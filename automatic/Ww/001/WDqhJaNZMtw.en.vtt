00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 staff speaks welcome to another 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.250
 video of saw here from canada big air 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.020
 lines and in this video we'll be 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.460
 taking a look at the newest series of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.070
 memories of the right color 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 the very fringes let's start giving 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 a look at the special features 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 that this new series of memories will 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 bring benefit to you who 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.840
 acquired in the case of a memory 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.369
 ddr3 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.769
 obviously it will work in any 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 motherboard that works with ddr3 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.340
 however it was developed to give a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 performance even more 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 intel third string processors 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 generation and especially from the fourth 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 generation where she received attention 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 to make it even easier to 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.670
 plus your overclock 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 the second special feature that is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.930
 necessary in relation to the other 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.449
 series of right color memory is that the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 c of them for who does not know what this is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 is that little chip that comes stuck in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.379
 to perceive is much thinner than the ordinary 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 making it a very compact memory 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.400
 already speaking of this internal part of the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 memory, another new feature of these 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 memories is to realize it than that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 part was green is one of those guys so 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 Stuck in the case of sales is is black but 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.659
 It's okay, just change the color. One is made with 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.700
 Eight layers of realizing this will do 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 with which she said pih the heat better and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.869
 which has more electric conduction 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670
 Nice to be able to work better with 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 you will need it to go 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.540
 seek a new sink forum from her that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.400
 is made entirely of aluminum with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 effect brushed due to lack of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.079
 sink now you all aluminum 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 and if radiator shuttle with some cuts and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.560
 with special regulations that 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.460
 will provide a cooling system 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.170
 much more efficient for xmb 1.3 than 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
 will be making this series available 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 an automatic overclock and like all 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 you must have already noticed 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.799
 it will come in several different colors 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.100
 we already have here available in the store the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.630
 silver red things and blue color too 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 promised that a version will be released 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 of gold that will come after 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.689
 Now I'll open up by saying here to 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.030
 You 're showing the face of these memories. 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.640
 of the new finishing of these sales and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.260
 content was very good from within 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.810
 box is very simple 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.170
 of the box had his certificate of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.430
 warranty and the kit is already packed inside 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.980
 of a basic box as you can 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.579
 see here are the three colors outside the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.439
 Cashier 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.290
 Let's get the first red one ever 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.750
 showed up in the video to show you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.569
 the radiator finish is really cool 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.150
 for you aluminum already in that part 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.340
 with the labels on the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.010
 color of memory for you to 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.370
 combine with your system and how 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.170
 I mentioned the types of them being more 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.329
 you can see that the memory is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.459
 more compact for example a corsair 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.129
 dominator a little thinner than the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:03.720
 old series comes says here is the hue 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:06.870
 silver changing with the blue tint 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.959
 the heads that come with the corsan logo 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.730
 well on top that also inscribed thigh 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.889
 comes from what is going to be exposed 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.690
 at the time you put it in your 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.519
 motherboard cut also announced that 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.329
 this new series sells itself will be tested 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:29.040
 available in 1600 neguete 1866mhz 2133 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:33.359
 megahertz 2,400 megahertz 2666 na 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.280
 gates two thousand and 800 megahertz 2933 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.930
 magath for you to have a better idea 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.510
 awareness of the size of these new 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.669
 memories wins for us put here 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.609
 she along with three other 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.160
 memory undac standard template question 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.250
 certain standard size to predict where it is 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.459
 bigger but as I mentioned here is a 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.530
 thing, see if it 's smaller than yours. 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.090
 predecessor as well as smaller than this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.919
 another previous issue because we 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.720
 place that has the same size 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.430
 Boy forces and only for you to have 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.349
 an idea of how it is going 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.720
 get rid of world full 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.819
 I got here a motherboard model of the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.310
 gigabyte that comes exactly in the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:17.329
 gray and blue tint 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:20.280
 I'll put it here for you from memory. 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.440
 blended pacheco and blended 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.310
 mainly with this new series 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.240
 in those launched exactly with the colors 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:45.440
 golden married and red and blue 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:48.950
 combining with those of good balls 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:54.680
 Nice to meet you perfectly. 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.820
 motherboard or if you want like this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 kit here

 the motherboard of the red wing is that the theme 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.700
 red 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.440
 they can put everything of the same color and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.110
 It was very cool too. 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:13.520
 from side to side 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.930
 How do you get the view on the motherboard? 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.930
 When you finish riding there. 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.100
 for more information on these memories 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.560
 about available frequency kits 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.360
 available voltage and all latency 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.100
 but would not leave a link in the description 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.320

 are many models to be able to speak 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.380
 for one here in this video, that's it 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.210
