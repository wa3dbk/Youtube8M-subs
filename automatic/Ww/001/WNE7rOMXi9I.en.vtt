00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.650 
has me right now it's like a elastic
wrist<00:02:15.629> strap<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:16.110> something<00:02:17.390> which<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> going

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
wrist strap or something which is going

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
wrist strap or something which is going
to<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:18.930> good<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.799> other

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
to be pretty good because the other

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.430 
to be pretty good because the other
wrist<00:02:20.160> strap<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.579> good<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.110> when<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.230> wash

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
wrist strap is good but when you wash

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.630 
wrist strap is good but when you wash
your<00:02:22.650> gloves<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.069> stuff<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.579> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
your gloves and stuff they kind of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.220 
your gloves and stuff they kind of
shrink<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.599> fit<00:02:24.810> into<00:02:24.930> place

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
shrink on you and kind of fit into place

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.930 
shrink on you and kind of fit into place
so<00:02:26.599> hopefully<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.750> won't<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
so hopefully this won't like do that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.360

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
out more so i'm probably gonna have to

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.600 
out more so i'm probably gonna have to
practice<00:04:12.440> with<00:04:12.590> these<00:04:12.770> for<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> while<00:04:13.550> to<00:04:14.030> uh<00:04:14.560> I

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
practice with these for a while to uh I

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.590 
practice with these for a while to uh I
don't<00:04:16.610> know<00:04:16.760> like<00:04:16.820> break<00:04:17.360> them<00:04:17.480> in<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:19.600> but

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600

right now they feel pretty good I think

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.590 
right now they feel pretty good I think
a<00:04:22.340> good<00:04:22.520> glove<00:04:22.880> wash<00:04:23.150> would<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:25.600> activate

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
a good glove wash would a like activate

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.170 
a good glove wash would a like activate
the<00:04:26.720> latex<00:04:27.260> on<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.590> front<00:04:27.830> make<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.280> more<00:04:28.460> grip

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
the latex on the front make it more grip

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.130 
yeah but the latex itself is pretty good
the<00:04:36.830> feel<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.430> really<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.670> padding<00:04:38.360> um<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
the feel is really a padding um the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.200 
the feel is really a padding um the
padding<00:04:39.470> on<00:04:39.590> my<00:04:40.040> competition<00:04:40.700> goes<00:04:40.820> really
