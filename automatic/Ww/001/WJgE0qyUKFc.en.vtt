00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180 
you're not really doing anything well
right<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.019> me<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.709> important

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
right there so for me the important

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.420 
right there so for me the important
stats<00:03:35.750> traditionally<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.959> fifa<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
stats traditionally on fifa and the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.530 
stats traditionally on fifa and the
reason<00:03:38.610> i'll<00:03:38.820> call<00:03:39.000> them<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> important

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
reason i'll call them the important

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.410 
reason i'll call them the important
stats<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.930> because<00:03:40.230> even<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:41.130> bronze<00:03:42.000> player

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
stats is because even on a bronze player

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.229 
stats is because even on a bronze player
had<00:03:42.780> decent<00:03:43.320> pace<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.799> decent<00:03:44.670> dribbling

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
had decent pace and decent dribbling

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.470 
had decent pace and decent dribbling
chances<00:03:46.049> are<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.860> could<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.340> successful<00:03:48.299> with

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
chances are you could be successful with

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.039 
chances are you could be successful with
them<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.200> style<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:50.100> play<00:03:50.810> dribbling<00:03:51.810> is

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
them for my style of play dribbling is

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.460 
them for my style of play dribbling is
one<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.580> most<00:03:54.470> important

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
one of if not the most important

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.650 
one of if not the most important
statistics<00:03:56.190> because<00:03:56.430> i<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.299> do<00:03:57.420> quick

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
statistics because i like to do quick

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.990 
statistics because i like to do quick
little<00:03:57.959> turns<00:03:58.320> i<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.950> awkward<00:03:59.519> things<00:03:59.760> with

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
little turns i do awkward things with

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.930 
little turns i do awkward things with
the<00:04:00.120> ball<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.720> keeping<00:04:01.709> control<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
the ball and keeping control of it is of

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.600 
the ball and keeping control of it is of
the<00:04:02.970> utmost<00:04:03.410> important<00:04:04.410> because<00:04:04.799> i<00:04:04.950> don't<00:04:05.340> try

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the utmost important because i don't try

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.690 
the utmost important because i don't try
to<00:04:06.180> play<00:04:06.590> ridiculous<00:04:07.590> passes<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> lot<00:04:08.280> i<00:04:08.430> tend

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
to play ridiculous passes a lot i tend

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.150 
to play ridiculous passes a lot i tend
to<00:04:08.760> take<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.209> easy<00:04:09.390> option<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.530> order<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.920> take

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
to take the easy option in order to take

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.270 
to take the easy option in order to take
the<00:04:11.280> easy<00:04:11.459> option<00:04:11.989> sometimes<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.560> kind<00:04:14.130> of

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
the easy option sometimes you kind of

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.860 
the easy option sometimes you kind of
get<00:04:14.370> yourself<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:14.850> twisted<00:04:15.360> around<00:04:15.480> so

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
get yourself a little twisted around so

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.710 
get yourself a little twisted around so
i<00:04:16.340> personally<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.790> not<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.479> player

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
i personally do not think that a player

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.469 
i personally do not think that a player
can<00:04:18.750> have<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.500> dribbling<00:04:19.950> stat<00:04:20.250> that's<00:04:20.489> really

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
can have a dribbling stat that's really

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.010 
can have a dribbling stat that's really
too<00:04:21.900> high<00:04:22.320> um<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:24.120> know<00:04:24.240> dribbling<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.750> feet<00:04:24.960> I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
too high um you know dribbling I feet I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.630 
too high um you know dribbling I feet I
think<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.289> improves<00:04:25.710> their<00:04:25.950> maybe<00:04:26.460> their

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
think it improves their maybe their

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.140 
think it improves their maybe their
balance

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
balance

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.249 
balance
as<00:04:27.270> well<00:04:27.449> in<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:27.690> game<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:27.900> their<00:04:28.080> ball

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
as well in this game are their ball

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.379 
as well in this game are their ball
control<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.370> they're<00:04:29.520> less<00:04:29.759> likely<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:30.210> be

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
control so they're less likely to be

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.140 
control so they're less likely to be
pushed<00:04:30.690> off<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.199> ball<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.650> think<00:04:31.949> they're<00:04:32.250> you

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
pushed off the ball I think they're you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.060 
pushed off the ball I think they're you
know<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.600> keep<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.350> ball<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.710> lot

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
know they just keep the ball a lot

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.129 
know they just keep the ball a lot
better<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:35.639> just<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.060> brilliant<00:04:36.509> brilliant

stat to have as a huge number m williams
passing<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.509> about<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:43.250> 75<00:04:44.250> now<00:04:44.520> because<00:04:44.850> i<00:04:44.880> take

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
passing is about a 75 now because i take

passing is about a 75 now because i take
the<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.530> think<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.889> about<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.070> seventh<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.490> could

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
the I think it's about a seventh I could

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.520 
the I think it's about a seventh I could
be<00:04:47.850> wrong<00:04:47.970> might<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.300> like<00:04:48.419> 78<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.259> because<00:04:49.500> I

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
be wrong might be like 78 but because I

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.029 
be wrong might be like 78 but because I
tend<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.919> take<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.280> easy<00:04:50.310> passing<00:04:51.300> option<00:04:51.780> I

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
tend to take the easy passing option I

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.990 
tend to take the easy passing option I
also<00:04:53.039> don't<00:04:54.169> necessarily<00:04:55.169> need<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:56.000> really

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
also don't necessarily need a really

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.390 
also don't necessarily need a really

really high passing statistic on my

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.310 
really high passing statistic on my

something<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.690> that's<00:05:03.720> fine<00:05:04.080> because<00:05:04.320> that's

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
something and that's fine because that's

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.860 
something and that's fine because that's
the<00:05:05.160> way<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.340> tend<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:05.850> play<00:05:05.970> this<00:05:06.150> game<00:05:06.360> I'm

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
the way I tend to play this game I'm

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.469 
the way I tend to play this game I'm
taking<00:05:07.260> an<00:05:07.380> easy<00:05:07.800> pass<00:05:08.250> into<00:05:08.940> my<00:05:09.060> center<00:05:09.330> for

taking an easy pass into my center for
now<00:05:09.660> sometimes<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:10.289> feel<00:05:10.440> like<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.800> little<00:05:11.340> bit

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
now sometimes I feel like a little bit

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.610 
now sometimes I feel like a little bit
of<00:05:11.610> an<00:05:11.789> improved<00:05:12.360> passing<00:05:12.930> statistic<00:05:13.440> could

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
of an improved passing statistic could

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.350 
of an improved passing statistic could
be<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> really<00:05:14.190> really<00:05:14.460> good<00:05:14.760> thing<00:05:15.030> for<00:05:15.240> my

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
that I get myself into driveling

about 10 times out of 10 and I was

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.310 
about 10 times out of 10 and I was
kicking<00:06:28.229> myself<00:06:28.500> because<00:06:28.800> I<00:06:29.220> done<00:06:29.909> enough<00:06:30.659> to

minute<00:06:33.539> now<00:06:33.780> I<00:06:33.840> thought<00:06:34.139> that<00:06:34.380> would<00:06:34.590> be

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
minute now I thought that would be

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.010 
minute now I thought that would be
enough<00:06:34.770> to<00:06:35.010> put<00:06:35.279> it<00:06:35.370> away<00:06:35.460> I<00:06:35.659> was<00:06:36.659> defending

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
his to legend strikers well enough not

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.970 
his to legend strikers well enough not
extremely

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
extremely

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.270 
extremely
but<00:06:41.970> well<00:06:42.240> enough<00:06:42.570> he'd<00:06:43.230> was<00:06:43.440> getting<00:06:43.800> chances

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
but well enough he'd was getting chances

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.980 
but well enough he'd was getting chances
um<00:06:44.580> that<00:06:45.120> he<00:06:45.240> was<00:06:45.390> unable<00:06:45.630> to<00:06:46.410> finish<00:06:47.150> but<00:06:48.150> four

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
um that he was unable to finish but four

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.930 
um that he was unable to finish but four
minutes<00:06:49.590> stoppage<00:06:49.800> time<00:06:50.040> and<00:06:50.460> you<00:06:50.610> can<00:06:50.760> see

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
minutes stoppage time and you can see

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.190 
minutes stoppage time and you can see
right<00:06:50.970> there<00:06:51.330> his<00:06:51.480> players<00:06:51.780> are<00:06:51.990> pushed

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
right there his players are pushed

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.470 
right there his players are pushed
forward<00:06:52.680> now<00:06:53.070> that<00:06:53.280> is<00:06:53.400> probably<00:06:53.790> because<00:06:53.880> he

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
forward now that is probably because he

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.020 
forward now that is probably because he
left<00:06:54.810> them<00:06:54.960> on<00:06:55.170> attacking<00:06:55.890> after<00:06:56.610> he<00:06:56.760> scored

left them on attacking after he scored

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.910 
left them on attacking after he scored
his<00:06:57.150> goal<00:06:57.450> and<00:06:57.660> I<00:06:57.960> thought<00:06:58.170> William<00:06:58.530> had<00:06:58.740> just

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
his goal and I thought William had just

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.140 
his goal and I thought William had just
won<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.190> game<00:06:59.340> for<00:06:59.370> me<00:06:59.580> I<00:06:59.670> couldn't<00:06:59.940> believe

won the game for me I couldn't believe

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.460 
won the game for me I couldn't believe
that<00:07:00.300> that<00:07:00.600> happened<00:07:00.960> I<00:07:00.990> thought<00:07:01.170> okay

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
that that happened I thought okay

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.080 
that that happened I thought okay
