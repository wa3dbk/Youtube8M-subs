00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
about the rocket though is that it does
take<00:01:38.069> quite<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.580> few<00:01:39.030> shots<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.630> kill<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.929> Titan

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
take quite a few shots to kill a Titan

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
take quite a few shots to kill a Titan
but<00:01:40.740> when<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.460> kill<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> tiny

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but when you actually do kill a tiny

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.419 
but when you actually do kill a tiny
which<00:01:42.149> rocket<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> rewarding<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
which rocket it is so rewarding and it

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.029 
which rocket it is so rewarding and it
feels<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.450> took<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.259> full<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
feels so good they took down a full and

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.980 
feels so good they took down a full and
be<00:01:47.250> tight<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.300> sidearm<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.869> guys

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
be tight and for your sidearm you guys

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.249 
be tight and for your sidearm you guys
want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> run<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.420> r45<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.690> auto<00:01:51.960> pistol

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
want to run the r45 it's auto pistol

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.040 
want to run the r45 it's auto pistol
it's<00:01:52.679> very<00:01:53.039> powerful<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.850> basically<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.690> think

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
it's very powerful and basically I think

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's very powerful and basically I think
you<00:01:55.110> guys<00:01:55.229> saw<00:01:55.470> me<00:01:55.500> use<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.069> beginning

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you guys saw me use it in the beginning

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.309 
you guys saw me use it in the beginning
of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.580> video<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.479> slap<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:58.049> it's

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
of the video I just slap it out it's

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.680 
of the video I just slap it out it's
fully<00:01:58.590> automatic<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.190> very<00:01:59.580> good<00:01:59.970> close<00:02:00.330> range

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
fully automatic is very good close range

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.870 
fully automatic is very good close range
of<00:02:00.780> its<00:02:00.899> deadly<00:02:01.560> I'll<00:02:01.679> tell<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.759> for

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of its deadly I'll tell you that and for

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
of its deadly I'll tell you that and for
the<00:02:02.940> tactical<00:02:03.360> ability<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.140> guys<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.409> on

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the tactical ability the guys are on

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
the tactical ability the guys are on
cloak<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.159> cloak<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.580> perfect<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.509> trying

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
cloak and cloak is perfect we're trying

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.259 
cloak and cloak is perfect we're trying
to<00:02:06.929> capture<00:02:07.170> hard<00:02:08.160> points<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.580> domination

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
to capture hard points on domination

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.330 
to capture hard points on domination
especially<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.130> can

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
especially because that way you can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.039 
especially because that way you can
cloak<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.850> then<00:02:12.180> no<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.780> able<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
cloak and then no one will be able to

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.539 
cloak and then no one will be able to
see<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:13.680> you're<00:02:13.799> camping<00:02:14.100> the

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
see you when you're camping the

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.550 
see you when you're camping the
hardpoint<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:15.959> walk<00:02:16.260> right

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
hardpoint and then when they walk right

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380 
hardpoint and then when they walk right
by<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.459> ahead<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.730> kill<00:02:18.030> them<00:02:18.269> or

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
by you you can go ahead and kill them or

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390 
by you you can go ahead and kill them or
even<00:02:18.480> back<00:02:18.870> kick<00:02:19.260> them<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.829> back<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> kill

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
even back kick them in the back and kill

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
even back kick them in the back and kill
them<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.670> way<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.600> ordinance<00:02:22.109> you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
them that way and for the ordinance you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.830 
them that way and for the ordinance you
guys<00:02:22.709> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> run<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.190> aarc<00:02:24.120> grenade<00:02:24.570> it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
guys want to run the aarc grenade it's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.500 
guys want to run the aarc grenade it's
most<00:02:25.200> effective<00:02:25.730> against<00:02:26.730> machines<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.390> it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
most effective against machines but it's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.360 
most effective against machines but it's
also<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:28.049> effective<00:02:28.230> against<00:02:28.920> pilots

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
also very effective against pilots

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
also very effective against pilots
themselves<00:02:29.519> which<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> enemy<00:02:30.900> players

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
themselves which are the enemy players

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500 
themselves which are the enemy players
and<00:02:31.799> basically<00:02:32.160> how<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> aarc<00:02:32.970> grenade<00:02:33.239> works

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and basically how the aarc grenade works

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.090 
and basically how the aarc grenade works
is<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> throw<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.380> at<00:02:34.500> people<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.980> it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
is that you throw it at people and it

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.550 
is that you throw it at people and it
stuns<00:02:35.579> them<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.000> shocks<00:02:36.329> them<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.350> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
stuns them and shocks them and then it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.530 
stuns them and shocks them and then it
just<00:02:37.590> readjust

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
just readjust

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.899 
just readjust

ruins their day like literally you can't

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.300 
ruins their day like literally you can't
