Nicolas<00:00:19.290> continent<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.160> we're<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
Nicolas continent and we're in the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.940 
Nicolas continent and we're in the
middle<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> hanging<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> show<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> moment

middle of hanging the show at the moment

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.480 
middle of hanging the show at the moment
we're<00:00:23.849> about<00:00:23.970> halfway<00:00:24.180> through<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.689> hang<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
we're about halfway through the hang and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.800 
we're about halfway through the hang and
we've<00:00:26.490> got<00:00:26.730> most<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> paintings<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.570> place

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
we've got most the paintings in place

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.780 
we've got most the paintings in place
that<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> sculpture<00:00:28.770> still<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> find

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
that the sculpture still has to find

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.780 
that the sculpture still has to find
it's<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.570> place<00:00:31.140> within<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> show<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.189> think

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it's in place within the show I think

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780 
it's in place within the show I think
here<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.300> story<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.199> of<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:35.190> artist<00:00:35.610> who

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
here the story was one of an artist who

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.869 
here the story was one of an artist who
works<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.930> intense<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.580> group

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
works in a very intense way on a group

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
works in a very intense way on a group
of<00:00:39.030> works<00:00:39.269> at<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> given<00:00:40.170> moment<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.710> then

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
of works at a given moment and then

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
of works at a given moment and then
quite<00:00:41.190> often<00:00:41.489> has<00:00:41.790> final<00:00:42.150> periods<00:00:42.600> between

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
quite often has final periods between

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.890 
quite often has final periods between
those<00:00:43.769> groups<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.519> so<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.540> show<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
those groups and so the show is

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.020 
those groups and so the show is
organized<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.830> way<00:00:46.979> that<00:00:47.309> reflects<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
organized in a way that reflects that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.939 
organized in a way that reflects that
with<00:00:48.330> each<00:00:48.720> room<00:00:49.049> given<00:00:49.559> over<00:00:49.799> to<00:00:49.830> a

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
with each room given over to a

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.070 
with each room given over to a
particular<00:00:50.280> theme<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.879> cycle<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
particular theme or cycle and the

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.649 
particular theme or cycle and the
challenge<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.589> is<00:00:52.979> you<00:00:53.790> do<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
challenge also is you do all this in

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.430 
challenge also is you do all this in
your<00:00:54.690> mind<00:00:55.250> when<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.400> selecting<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:56.909> show

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
your mind when you're selecting the show

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.619 
your mind when you're selecting the show
you<00:00:58.440> plead<00:00:58.769> desperately<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.640> people<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.540> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
you plead desperately with people to the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.740 
you plead desperately with people to the
end<00:01:00.839> these<00:01:01.080> precious<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.860> fragile<00:01:01.979> objects

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
end these precious and fragile objects

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
end these precious and fragile objects
and<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.199> hope<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.949> all

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and you just hope that when they all

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
and you just hope that when they all
come<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> room<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.690> they<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.049> speak

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
come into the room that they will speak

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
come into the room that they will speak
to<00:01:07.500> each<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.830> rather<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.610> crowd<00:01:08.909> each

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to each other rather than crowd each

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.590 
to each other rather than crowd each
other<00:01:09.270> out

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
other out

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020

Chompy<00:01:10.440> was<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.920> Iran<00:01:11.100> unusual<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.790> think

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Chompy was really Iran unusual I think

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
Chompy was really Iran unusual I think
from<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> early<00:01:12.780> years<00:01:13.350> being<00:01:14.119> equally

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
from the early years being equally

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.760 
from the early years being equally
active<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.810> both<00:01:15.930> painting<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.439> sculpture

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
active in both painting and sculpture

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
active in both painting and sculpture
and<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> first<00:01:17.729> room<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.960> artist

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and in this first room you see an artist

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.230 
and in this first room you see an artist
who<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.430> conscious<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.090> working

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
who you're very conscious of him working

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
who you're very conscious of him working
with<00:01:21.420> his<00:01:21.600> hands<00:01:21.990> he<00:01:22.170> doesn't<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.920> huge

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
with his hands he doesn't make huge

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.060 
with his hands he doesn't make huge
sculptures<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.900> paintings<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.860> much

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
sculptures the paintings are very much

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
sculptures the paintings are very much
about<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.520> graphic<00:01:26.910> mark<00:01:27.150> they're<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.260> much

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
about the graphic mark they're very much

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
about the graphic mark they're very much
about<00:01:28.620> his<00:01:28.800> own<00:01:28.980> reach<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
about his own reach and about the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
about his own reach and about the
movement<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.110> paint<00:01:31.410> or<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> brush

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
movement of the paint or the brush

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.430 
movement of the paint or the brush
across<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.910> canvas<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.260> very

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
across the canvas so you're very

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.380 
across the canvas so you're very
conscious<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.400> way<00:01:35.490> through<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.150> show

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
conscious all the way through this show

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.500 
conscious all the way through this show
I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.260> this<00:01:37.500> sense<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> man

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
I think of all this sense of a man

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.080 
I think of all this sense of a man
making<00:01:40.080> marks<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.830> trying<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> express

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
making marks and trying to express

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
making marks and trying to express
himself<00:01:42.650> both<00:01:43.650> in<00:01:43.890> painting<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.370> sculpture

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
himself both in painting and sculpture

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
himself both in painting and sculpture
as<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.600> leave<00:01:45.870> that<00:01:46.080> first<00:01:46.320> room<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.830> walk

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
as we leave that first room we walk

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.850 
as we leave that first room we walk
through<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.030> whole<00:01:48.600> series<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> drawings<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
through a whole series of drawings that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.580 
through a whole series of drawings that
were<00:01:50.430> almost<00:01:51.390> automatic<00:01:52.200> writing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
were almost automatic writing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
were almost automatic writing
you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.190> close<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.670> eyes<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you know you close your eyes and you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.030 
you know you close your eyes and you
make<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> mark<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.409> make<00:01:55.560> another<00:01:55.860> mark

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
make a mark and you make another mark

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
make a mark and you make another mark
and<00:01:56.340> another<00:01:56.580> mark<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.120> then<00:01:57.330> build<00:01:57.570> up

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and another mark and you then build up

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.070 
and another mark and you then build up
an<00:01:58.020> image<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.190> coming<00:01:59.670> from<00:01:59.900> within

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
an image which is coming from within

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.990 
an image which is coming from within
rather<00:02:01.800> than<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> representation<00:02:02.880> of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
rather than a representation of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149

something<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.080> became<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> principle

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
something and that became a principle

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.730 
something and that became a principle
that<00:02:05.340> really<00:02:05.670> was<00:02:06.000> underlay<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.560> work

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that really was underlay all the work

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.460 
that really was underlay all the work
from<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> point<00:02:08.369> onwards<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.170> room

from that point onwards in this room

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.500 
from that point onwards in this room
that<00:02:10.769> we've<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.129> moved<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:12.390> are

that we've now moved into these are

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
that we've now moved into these are
paintings<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.370> much<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.580> liquid

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
paintings that are much more liquid

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.479 
paintings that are much more liquid
they're<00:02:15.540> painted<00:02:16.049> across<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.769> whole<00:02:16.950> canvas

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
they're painted across the whole canvas

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.460 
they're painted across the whole canvas
obviously<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.629> particular<00:02:18.930> group<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
obviously the particular group that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.490 
obviously the particular group that
we're<00:02:19.590> looking<00:02:19.680> at<00:02:19.950> here

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
we're looking at here

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.550 
we're looking at here
it's<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.460> group<00:02:21.670> which<00:02:21.940> has<00:02:22.720> many<00:02:23.020> affinities

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
it's a group which has many affinities

it's a group which has many affinities
of<00:02:23.770> course<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> work<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.550> Turner<00:02:24.790> and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
of course with the work of Turner and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.290 
of course with the work of Turner and
Twombly<00:02:26.320> became<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.310> interested<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.030> think

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
Twombly became very interested I think

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.200 
Twombly became very interested I think
in<00:02:28.450> Turner's<00:02:28.810> work<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.580> late<00:02:30.730> seventies

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
in Turner's work in the late seventies

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.900 
in Turner's work in the late seventies
and<00:02:31.240> early<00:02:31.360> eighties<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:33.040> he<00:02:33.250> also<00:02:33.430> became

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
and early eighties and he also became

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.550 
and early eighties and he also became
very<00:02:34.180> interested<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> idea<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:35.170> bringing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
very interested in the idea of bringing

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.690 
very interested in the idea of bringing
into<00:02:35.830> these<00:02:35.980> paintings<00:02:37.320> ideas<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.920> he<00:02:39.490> had

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
into these paintings ideas that he had

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.570 
into these paintings ideas that he had
found<00:02:40.410> expressed<00:02:41.410> not<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:41.950> much<00:02:42.070> in<00:02:42.220> painting

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
found expressed not so much in painting

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.800 
found expressed not so much in painting
but<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.850> poetry<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:44.580> poets<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:45.730> Wilker<00:02:46.570> and

closer I think to the elements here we

closer I think to the elements here we
are<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.860> final<00:03:18.220> room<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.580> show<00:03:18.790> where

you see Trombley again reinventing his

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.470 
you see Trombley again reinventing his
whole<00:03:23.650> way<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.980> working<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:25.060> paintings<00:03:25.390> of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
whole way of working the paintings of

something totally new and I think that

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.970 
something totally new and I think that
they<00:03:56.860> make<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.100> very<00:03:57.190> interesting<00:03:58.620> end<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.890> the

they make a very interesting end to the

they make a very interesting end to the
