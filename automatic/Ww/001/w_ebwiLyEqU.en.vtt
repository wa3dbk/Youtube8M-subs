00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.259
 hi cuber are hypercubes welcome in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.440
 this new road to video 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.160
 battlefield 4 very close to the previous one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 because from the source I have 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 used to give you the latest news 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.029
 on the doe survival 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 here is the confirmation from 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.890
 electronic art of the survey to which 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 many gamers have been submitted 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 I don't believe in Italy to be honest a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
 what part of the survey was published 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.550
 only in English and then usually 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.649
 unfortunately we do not count enough then 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 keep screens and grow me if 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 you want these aspects to be butterfield 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 are made more important in Italy 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 who knows maybe one day when I arrive 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.309
 1500 members with something more 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.489
 in any case we talk about so important 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 Well the first has published the images 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.500
 of the survey I invite you to go to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 see after you've seen this video 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.040
 if you don't want to visit the link that I am 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.299
 put in description and ticked off 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 things far more precise even from 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.210
 extract to extract from this 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.030
 poll 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 first the type of questions was 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.320
 I would never be really precise 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.840
 waited for such a thing indeed 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.880
 there might even be going a little 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 better but there are things that are far more important 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.670
 big of what we talked about 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.300
 the other time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.910
 first of all 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.830
 as you will see from the site maybe with mine 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.690
 voice in the background 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.020
 you see the first image concerning 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.810
 a possible purchase method that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.920
 would like the gamer for battlefield 4 but 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.650
 moving his things that interest us 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.430
 really questions about naval warfare 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.030
 they were really tight and referred 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.060
 to a hypothetical name for an expansion 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.670
 pack then for a dlc on the part 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.250
 naval battlefield 4 even the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 assumptions as you will see from the article were 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.690
 of names as it goes to social networks 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.900
 tidal absolved stint aids rising ssis e 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.620
 things like that are all 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.130
 and it is the last era of psi and damn it 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.950
 kids involve everyone at the level for 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.590
 least metaphor for fighting 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.320
 naval ships between big big ships 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.170
 boats large vehicles and therefore it is 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.210
 possible at this point to see in 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.930
 even battlefield 4 maybe a nice one 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.650
 submarine after which it was asked for 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.650
 another 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.030
 another point of the survey 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.340
 new type of prototype weapons one 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.210
 combination of vehicles and from 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.740
 cicu fighting and was asked 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.040
 precisely the name for this other dlc that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.390
 could be prototype futur strike 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.370
 confidential classified and therefore 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.800
 however a dlc more infantry for we say 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.050
 promote the use of the infantry of the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.720
 there was fighting though maybe with 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.600
 some stranger weapon is usable 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.790
 in that mode 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:33.480
 after which others were requested 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.030
 some questions on the cover possible 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.860
 for battlefield 4 and the question that 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.060
 included the dinosaurs just came 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 after this cover 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.250
 in practice it was asked when 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.140
 treats of and fps games 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.780
 there are some themes that you would never want 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.090
 play in a fps and was asked 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.330
 precisely scifi that would be of the series 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.640
 far cry 3 blood dragon something of 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.630
 genre in any case is a sci fi that is the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.880
 classic generates seventies of 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.850
 science fiction is a bit exaggerated with lights 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.100
 exaggerated, etc. and then military moder 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.340
 second World War 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.170
 medieval policemen and thieves 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.430
 prehistoric and that is where the whole was born 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.130
 speech on the dinosaurs then 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.440
 it is essentially probable that the dais 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.990
 really want to publish is a 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.780
 dlc for battlefield 4 with one mode 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.380
 stranger than the modern one 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.690
 warfare but not necessarily linked 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.409
 simply dinosaurs indeed 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.689
 expansion 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.969
 who knows maybe based on the coop on 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.649
 fun that includes one of the 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.940
 categories that you see anyway on 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:46.530
 poll I linked to you 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.680
 at that point people started to 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.420
 ask to comment on this article 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.480
 this matters little because the survey 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.540
 it was already out even talk of 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.640
 even more important things 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.420
 and here we come to the environments 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.680
 destructible it seems that from a 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:12.000
 white talked with these with these 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.990
 surface with these scenario surveys 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.600
 dynamic dynamic scenarios means that 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.410
 substantially the maps are modified 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.920
 as through the destructibility of the 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.390
 objects of houses of parts of land that 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.160
 thus they would modify the layout of the 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.930
 map and fatic level would open a 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.150
 the scene beyond this attention 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.790
 concerns the vehicles have been made 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.700
 of questions concerning 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.280
 alarms of the operating methods of the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.070
 vehicle itself etc. and so on 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.210
 who knows maybe they could even propose 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.190
 what we talked about at 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.810
 ie planetside ammunition not 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.370
 endless on the media so that every now and then 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.169
 we have to go to some location of 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.050
 recharge that in seconds gives us back the 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.510
 shots in that way we avoid spam of 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.700
 bullets that some like to others 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.830
 less in any case always discuss 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.570
 maybe in the comments of this video 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.790
 another very important thing is the 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.860
 possibility to have a dynamic weather 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.960
 imagine an island of card that to a 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.400
 a certain point becomes a single storm 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.330
 where no more rain can be seen 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.510
 casino sea that gets moved well 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.670
 this is expected 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.750
 apparently unbeaten iv ie to have 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.070
 the dynamic weather guys like to say 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.380
 vegetables in the soup 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.390
 after this video there are many 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.490
 especially because almost all of them are 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.010
 close to official 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.230
 so go wild in the comments because 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.000
 road to beat 4 does not stop there i 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.310
 boys up to 29 October each time 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.570
 what good friends will see you in 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.670
 next video thanks for following 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.200
