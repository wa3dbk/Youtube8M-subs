hopefully by now you've seen our video

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.570 
hopefully by now you've seen our video
about<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> tint<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.140> roll-up<00:00:04.620> window<00:00:05.009> but

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
about how to tint a roll-up window but

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.600 
about how to tint a roll-up window but
there's<00:00:05.790> more<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> story<00:00:07.099> some<00:00:08.099> cars<00:00:08.460> have

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
there's more to the story some cars have

there's more to the story some cars have
frameless<00:00:09.389> windows<00:00:09.780> here's<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> handle

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
frameless windows here's how to handle

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:49.819 
frameless windows here's how to handle
those<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> pro<00:00:12.990> or<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> rockstar

cutting<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.500> film<00:00:54.710> for<00:00:55.040> our<00:00:55.160> frameless<00:00:55.610> door

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
cutting the film for our frameless door

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.150 
cutting the film for our frameless door
window<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:56.600> very<00:00:56.990> similar<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.470> cutting<00:00:57.770> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
window is very similar to cutting the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.670 
window is very similar to cutting the
film<00:00:58.460> on<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:58.760> rollup<00:00:59.300> window<00:00:59.870> with<00:01:00.290> a<00:01:00.320> frame

however<00:01:01.490> there<00:01:01.910> are<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.150> few<00:01:02.630> key<00:01:02.960> differences

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
however there are a few key differences

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.550 
however there are a few key differences
whether<00:01:04.580> use<00:01:04.820> single<00:01:05.180> cut<00:01:05.449> or<00:01:05.660> double<00:01:06.080> cut<00:01:06.290> and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
whether use single cut or double cut and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.080 
whether use single cut or double cut and
get<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.860> piece<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.220> film<00:01:07.460> ready<00:01:07.730> that<00:01:07.940> you're

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
get the piece of film ready that you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.560 
get the piece of film ready that you're
going<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.480> use<00:01:09.190> then<00:01:10.190> cut<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.670> front<00:01:10.970> edge<00:01:11.210> so

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
going to use then cut the front edge so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.030 
going to use then cut the front edge so
that<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:11.900> parallel<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.250> front<00:01:13.460> seal

that it's parallel to the front seal

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.580 
that it's parallel to the front seal
once<00:01:16.040> you've<00:01:16.250> done<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:17.440> reposition<00:01:18.440> the

once you've done this reposition the
film<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.310> front<00:01:19.670> edge<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.240> bottom
