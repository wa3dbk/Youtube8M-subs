the field a potassium deficiency is

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.460 
the field a potassium deficiency is
pretty<00:00:18.630> characteristic<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.580> marginal

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470

necrosis<00:00:22.789> along<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.970> edges<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.020> leaf<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
necrosis along the edges of the leaf and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
necrosis along the edges of the leaf and
this<00:00:26.310> begins<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> base<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.900> plant

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
this begins at the base of the plant

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.830 
this begins at the base of the plant
first<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.699> moves<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.960> plant<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.129> the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
first and then moves up the plant as the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.220 
first and then moves up the plant as the
deficiency<00:00:33.840> becomes<00:00:34.260> progressively<00:00:34.680> worse

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
deficiency becomes progressively worse
the<00:00:37.230> symptoms<00:00:37.680> express<00:00:38.190> themselves<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.000> way

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the symptoms express themselves this way

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
the symptoms express themselves this way
because<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.320> plant<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.890> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.340> mobilize

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
because the plant is able to mobilize

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.770 
because the plant is able to mobilize
the<00:00:42.360> potassium<00:00:42.720> from<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> older<00:00:43.860> leaves<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the potassium from the older leaves and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
the potassium from the older leaves and
send<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> newer<00:00:46.469> leaves<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.100> order<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
send it to the newer leaves in order to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.240 
send it to the newer leaves in order to
continue<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.300> grow<00:00:48.800> potassium<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.860> especially

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
continue to grow potassium is especially

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
continue to grow potassium is especially
important<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> plant<00:00:51.690> during<00:00:51.930> drought

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
important in the plant during drought

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040 
important in the plant during drought
because<00:00:52.800> potassium<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.420> important<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
because potassium is very important in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
because potassium is very important in
controlling<00:00:55.469> stone<00:00:55.950> model<00:00:56.239> opening<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
controlling stone model opening and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
controlling stone model opening and
closing<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.500> allows<00:00:58.890> co2<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.850> for

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
closing which allows co2 in for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.110 
closing which allows co2 in for
photosynthesis<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.620> also<00:01:01.890> controls<00:01:02.700> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
photosynthesis but also controls the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.680 
photosynthesis but also controls the
loss<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.660> moisture<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.039> plant<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
loss of moisture from the plant or

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.660 
loss of moisture from the plant or
transpiration<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> Stowe<00:01:08.430> mates

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
transpiration and so the Stowe mates

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
transpiration and so the Stowe mates
react<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.360> slowly<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:10.200> potassium<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> low

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
react very slowly when potassium is low

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.359 
react very slowly when potassium is low
and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.390> plant<00:01:12.750> ends<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.259> losing<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:14.009> water

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and the plant ends up losing more water

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.660 
and the plant ends up losing more water
than<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.149> would<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.539> it<00:01:15.690> had<00:01:15.720> adequate

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
than it would if it had adequate

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
than it would if it had adequate
potassium<00:01:17.670> potassium<00:01:18.509> also<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.679> responsible

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
potassium potassium also is responsible

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.880 
potassium potassium also is responsible
for<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.330> plant<00:01:21.599> being<00:01:21.959> able<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.319> take<00:01:22.679> up

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
for the plant being able to take up

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.660 
for the plant being able to take up
water<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:24.110> provides<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.470> driving<00:01:25.979> force<00:01:26.340> for

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
water it provides the driving force for

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.419 
water it provides the driving force for
a<00:01:26.700> root<00:01:26.970> uptake<00:01:27.929> of<00:01:27.959> water<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.009> again

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
a root uptake of water and so again

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.910 
a root uptake of water and so again
during<00:01:29.729> drought<00:01:30.179> when<00:01:30.899> accumulation<00:01:31.800> of

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.930

I think the drought and the inability
