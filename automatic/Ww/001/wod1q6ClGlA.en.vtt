00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.060
 I would live here, but the video is welcome. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.130
 this time guys 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.320
 need for speed anger I had to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 opportunity to play it at e3 to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.920
 gay invitation and I must say that it was 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 very faithful to be able to play these games 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.940
 not yet launched right 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 but I must confess that I am not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.619
 very fan of mega racing games fan 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 not a thing worth remembering 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.880
 of an interesting thing that I think is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 that racing games are much better 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 graphically if most of the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 other games 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 perhaps for the reason he only simulated the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.590
 car and the environment is easier than 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 a computer has achieved a loyalty 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 ever increasing graph 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 but no more nor is the 1st 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 It's very beautiful, and it's a game. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.870
 many other games there too on e3 nÃ© 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.289
 this is the need for speed angry and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 it looks like his cool thing actually 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.020
 is that you play a race actually 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.780
 have an open world open map you 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.129
 you can go to several places and on this map 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.449
 There are some races you can 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.250
 start right 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.439
 after you start just by this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 running you will be counting points that is the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.159
 sp the speedy bridges as you go 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 type 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.259
 completing the race by crashing into cars 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.840
 the police or doing the drift will 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.520
 earning more movie points and then 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.590
 of a certain period of time which is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 the race that happens goes 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 the game will launch cops behind 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 Do you speak Caraca Ferrou? 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.409
 but the coolest of all is that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 cops they can get intelligence 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.060
 but they can also be 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.790
 knows your own friends or guys 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 on the internet because the game will be good 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.729
 you forever right 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.009
 of course you can apparently 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.890
 play offline also no you do not have 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.840
 this need of the game if online is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.360
 Because I understood why I understood 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280
 more or less so, but it's nice of me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 I've also seen other racing games and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.049
 most of them bring this innovation 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 in the multiplayer sense of the thing, right? 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.850
 because I imagine playing with a game of 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.770
 other people's race should be a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 experience much more iron nÃ© 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 And you can also play with the police officer. 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.509
 Can you already catch the cop? 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.239
 subjective as 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.599
 if it is to destroy the cars and arrest them 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.549
 huh 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can even try to 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.290
 your friends just used on the face and the day 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.349
 I must confess that I am the most 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.150
 the world's horrible playing in the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.860
 You can see that the direct hit 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 sometimes I could do some 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.290
 beautiful things like that I kept like this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 Mega happy, right, and you'll see that one 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
 part of the game so I can start walking 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.909
 against me i'm very dumb 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.970
 There it is now that I found a race 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.730
 I was looking for a race, whatever. 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.370
 sane and titanium is an event for you 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.730
 enter does not press l1 you accept the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.950
 racing starts you can even get 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.170
 she win there you have to go if you 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.319
 Minimalism look you have to follow 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.569
 this green until the race is over and 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.760
 tv that one hour I know there I had to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.920
 forced battikha twitter as trade and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.450
 unlike the arrow comes from face what 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.180
 most have difficulty in games 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.889
 race is to make the curve what I eat 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.840
 always end up knocking on the wall or 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.329
 slowing down everyone passing by 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.760
 my front of course this video was 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.540
 shipped with liquid nitrogen 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 that you can use you take the rapidion 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.220
 and also you have an emmy pen that is 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.720
 impulsive but ibra there I do not know what it is 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.730
 mpe mpt with a grenade that turns off the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.949
 car you lose total control 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.720
 You can use that for the police there. 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.760
 was even trying to use it has 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.680
 that looking a little hard can be used 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.780
 the police and can use in other 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.780
 competitors have already used it myself 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.069
 I earn points while I'm dumb yet 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.669
 hit him right? 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.560
 so then you use that which is very good 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.720
 then I started already against houses or 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.819
 very good, the guy can see that there is 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.430
 certain green is being there from the bottom of the 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.739
 my car is means everything 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.489
 on the contrary, it is getting worse and 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.340
 funny dance is that it was that kind of 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.349
 a girl there that he was helping to 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.739
 people that were playing I was 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.599
 connected on the other hand nessun bc 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.229
 here I said I do not know that I'm in 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.300
 another hand mancini psychiatrist decided 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.340
 her publisher talked about investing but should 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.050
 because I was really seeing myself if I 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.750
 continuing my work here is very tiring 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.699
 ass but including also had one of the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.740
 guys who developed this game there he 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.349
 He said it really is the face against 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.539
 even the guy who made the game saw that 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.970
 I'm a complete idiot and should the 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.060
 racing games but that is part of 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.419
 she is accustomed to playing running is 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.729
 good and another interesting thing is that 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.949
 the game between the name of a building that 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.860
 this is crazy if this scenario so you 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.080
 try for various things you can go 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.840
 for a different way this is cool I 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.000
 I like it at least and you can live there. 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.860
 which has more lists of things like 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.759
 filled squares and 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.190
 others do not 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.440
 that's it, it's missions you have 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.169
 during a short run the more 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.970
 missions you complete the more points you 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.280
 will complete what these call for peace in 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.599
 a car and chased me drugs in the car 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.389
 Police in growth drive 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.789
 very wild even then if you 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.900
 complete all and if that tikrit it 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.490
 I followed more points and after you 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.080
 complete the race 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.270
 who wins I think there must be more 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.000
 points you lose earns less and you 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.650
 can compare and compete with everything 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.360
 world that was playing talk i did 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.560
 The more points you make, the more points you get. 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.599
 it's a hospital 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.520
 and more like jade there was when 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.800
 You're against me, I'm stupid to come. 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.919
 car and I got the car there the more 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.509
 Points you make more pieces and will buy 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.969
 such and such could not see much of it because 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.490
 the game was in phase to the total neither they 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.590
 nor did I record a little of the map and 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.969
 they said nothing but can write the map me 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.370
 gave a scold 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.479
 Then I said boy I'm going to map only 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.400
 I 'm not going to take 1 but there. 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.009
 Then you can leave the race too. 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.060
 That's what I did there when I was already 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:21.250
 It's horrible I'm leaving her and what? 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.770
 start again and this sp 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.620
 he stays there guys you keep up with him 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.320
 no matter how many things you do or 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.000
 no and you are only 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.460
 I got six points even when you go 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.320
 for such a garage and such is not the 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.720
 police case hits you several 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.420
 times and tietÃª capture 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.160
 you lose all your points what it is 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.320
 Damn it and you have to start it all. 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.500
 again it's good if you kinda 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.300
 save your points by going to the warehouse there 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.800
 that the hospital garage is not 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.420
 But that's it guys this is the need 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.130
 Thank you so much for everything, ever. 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.130
 There was and will be next time.
