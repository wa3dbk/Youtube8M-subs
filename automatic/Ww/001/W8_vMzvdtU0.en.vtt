took up really far for fine detailed
utility<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:11.939> versus<00:01:12.869> having<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.200> big<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
utility work versus having a big you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.889 
utility work versus having a big you
know<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> sloppy<00:01:15.270> work<00:01:15.600> around

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
know way to kind of sloppy work around

alright guys then we're gonna take a

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.559 
alright guys then we're gonna take a
look<00:01:31.830> at<00:01:32.039> some<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> combat<00:01:33.030> application

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
look at some of the combat application

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.270 
look at some of the combat application
of<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.750> knife<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.890> interesting

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
of this knife what are the interesting

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.040 
of this knife what are the interesting
things<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> angle<00:01:36.240> between<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> handle

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
things is the angle between the handle

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.820 
things is the angle between the handle
and<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.440> blade<00:01:37.470> you'll<00:01:38.310> notice<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.149> not<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
and the blade you'll notice it's not a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.219 
and the blade you'll notice it's not a
perfectly<00:01:40.830> linear<00:01:41.310> design<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.929> allows

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
perfectly linear design what this allows

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
perfectly linear design what this allows
you<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.979> again<00:01:44.220> primarily<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.850> Filipino

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you to do is again primarily a Filipino

you<00:01:50.429> can<00:01:50.459> see<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.179> know<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.690> additional

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
you can see you know the the additional

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.840 
you can see you know the the additional
positive<00:01:52.679> contact<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.340> gonna<00:01:53.429> have<00:01:53.700> with

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
positive contact you're gonna have with

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.340 
positive contact you're gonna have with
the<00:01:53.970> blade<00:01:54.209> just<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> angle<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the blade just because of the angle of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
the blade just because of the angle of
that<00:01:55.470> four<00:01:55.770> slashes<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.569> primarily<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that four slashes so this is primarily a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.889 
that four slashes so this is primarily a
