hair the hair started kind of matting up
getting<00:01:27.030> tangled<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.280> didn't<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.759> shed

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
getting tangled it didn't really shed

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
getting tangled it didn't really shed
unless<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.470> aggressively

brushing<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:34.140> hair<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:34.740> obviously

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
brushing the hair and then obviously

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
brushing the hair and then obviously
it's<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> shed<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.240> aggressively

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it's going to shed if I aggressively

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's going to shed if I aggressively
brush<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> hair<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.090> only

I'm<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.690> sure<00:01:56.870> what's<00:01:57.050> going<00:01:57.080> on<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.770> don't

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
I'm not sure what's going on I don't

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.980 
I'm not sure what's going on I don't
know<00:01:57.980> if<00:01:58.040> it's<00:01:58.220> something<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.700> did<00:01:59.120> but

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
know if it's something that I did but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.810 
know if it's something that I did but
the<00:02:00.110> hair<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.290> matting<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.160> didn't<00:02:01.430> expect

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the hair is matting and I didn't expect

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.550 
the hair is matting and I didn't expect
it<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.000> happen<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.690> she<00:02:02.810> was<00:02:02.930> telling<00:02:03.110> me<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
it to happen and she was telling me that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.110 
it to happen and she was telling me that
she<00:02:03.770> was<00:02:03.860> shocked<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:04.340> she's<00:02:04.700> never<00:02:04.880> got

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
she was shocked because she's never got

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120 
she was shocked because she's never got
enough<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:05.900> complaining<00:02:06.470> about<00:02:06.620> this<00:02:06.890> hair

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
enough but complaining about this hair

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.260 
enough but complaining about this hair
because<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.640> their<00:02:07.820> most<00:02:08.030> popular

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
because this is their most popular

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.240 
because this is their most popular
texture<00:02:09.080> which<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.440> understand<00:02:09.860> because<00:02:09.980> it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
texture which I understand because it's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.360 
texture which I understand because it's
beautiful<00:02:11.350> but<00:02:12.350> later<00:02:12.650> she<00:02:12.920> did<00:02:13.100> do<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
beautiful but later she did do the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.980 
beautiful but later she did do the
research<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.060> figure<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.810> was

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
research and figure it out but it was

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.840 
research and figure it out but it was
the<00:02:15.170> bags<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.530> conditioner<00:02:16.100> which<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.430> great

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the bags of conditioner which is great

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.090 
the bags of conditioner which is great
because<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.660> shows<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.650> she<00:02:18.860> does

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
because that shows you that she does

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.280 
because that shows you that she does
really<00:02:19.700> care<00:02:19.970> about<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> customer

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
really care about you and the customer

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.200 
really care about you and the customer
not<00:02:21.650> she<00:02:21.950> doesn't<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.430> want<00:02:22.520> her<00:02:22.790> money<00:02:22.910> like

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
not she doesn't just want her money like

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.680 
not she doesn't just want her money like
I<00:02:23.330> said<00:02:23.510> before<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:24.440> my<00:02:25.010> previous<00:02:25.670> review<00:02:26.300> she

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
I said before in my previous review she

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.540 
I said before in my previous review she
actually<00:02:26.870> did<00:02:27.200> take<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> time<00:02:27.800> out<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.100> figure

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
actually did take the time out to figure

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.720 
actually did take the time out to figure
out<00:02:28.820> what<00:02:28.940> was<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.310> after<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.550> couple

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
out what was going on so after a couple

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.930 
out what was going on so after a couple
of<00:02:32.300> emails<00:02:33.140> back<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.860> forth<00:02:34.130> she<00:02:34.280> came<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
of emails back and forth she came to the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640 
of emails back and forth she came to the
conclusion<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.720> because<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.110> left<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.440> bag

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
conclusion that because I left the bag

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.010 
conclusion that because I left the bag
and<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.400> hair<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:37.970> bags<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.510> conditioner

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
and the hair in the bags of conditioner

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.700 
and the hair in the bags of conditioner
for<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.470> long<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:40.570> stripped<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.660> protein<00:02:42.080> the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
for so long I stripped the protein the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.100 
for so long I stripped the protein the
natural<00:02:43.160> protein<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.000> oils<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.900> hair

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
natural protein and the oils of the hair

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.990 
natural protein and the oils of the hair
so<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:45.950> why<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.250> hair<00:02:46.460> was<00:02:46.610> getting<00:02:46.880> on

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
so that's why the hair was getting on

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.850 
so that's why the hair was getting on
matted<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.480> tangled<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.470> was<00:02:48.590> thinking

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
matted and tangled so I was thinking

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.200 
matted and tangled so I was thinking
okay<00:02:48.950> well<00:02:49.310> maybe<00:02:49.430> I'll<00:02:49.730> look<00:02:50.300> up<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:51.140> DIY

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
okay well maybe I'll look up like a DIY

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.720 
okay well maybe I'll look up like a DIY
protein<00:02:53.210> rich<00:02:53.510> deep<00:02:54.500> conditioner<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> did

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
protein rich deep conditioner so I did

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.100 
protein rich deep conditioner so I did
and<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.260> put<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.410> bag<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.850> took<00:02:59.420> off<00:02:59.600> my<00:02:59.630> new<00:02:59.870> part

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.000 
and I put the bag I took off my new part
and<00:03:00.290> put<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.740> bag<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:02.110> made<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.470> mixture

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and put it in a bag of I made a mixture

and put it in a bag of I made a mixture
of<00:03:04.130> eggs<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.120> mayonnaise<00:03:05.570> which<00:03:06.230> sounds

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
of eggs and mayonnaise which sounds

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.860 
of eggs and mayonnaise which sounds

really weird but whatever that's what I

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.380 
really weird but whatever that's what I
did<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:10.130> left<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:10.880> there<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.060> like
