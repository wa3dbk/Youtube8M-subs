00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.310 

not<00:01:04.830> bad<00:01:06.110> what<00:01:07.110> I've<00:01:07.260> inbound<00:01:09.110> patterns<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
not bad what I've inbound patterns of

not bad what I've inbound patterns of
behavior<00:01:11.390> Samson<00:01:12.390> Callender<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:14.360> think<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
behavior Samson Callender I think that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.170 
behavior Samson Callender I think that
sometimes<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:16.400> okay<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.730> northern<00:01:17.940> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
sometimes more okay so the northern of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.150 
sometimes more okay so the northern of
the<00:01:18.240> central<00:01:18.630> line<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.410> tooth<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
the central line are on the tooth but

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.480 
the central line are on the tooth but
then<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> only<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.490> 700

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
then he is only for and there are 700

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:33.680 
then he is only for and there are 700
