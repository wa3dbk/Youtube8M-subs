00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.180
 Real and today I came to help in 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.770
 some people who are having the mistake 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.570
 with minecraft i'm searching 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.359
 because I had a mistake here with 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.210
 minecraft and I searched and saw that many 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.679
 people have this error too but they do not have 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 answers right 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.550
 the errors and the answers are very 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.350
 or are they gringos 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.180
 It turns out that people do not understand much 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.720
 well then I came to give a solution 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.780

 Right, right. 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.299

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.220
