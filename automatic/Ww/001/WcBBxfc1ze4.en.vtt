header up there for pin CPU power so

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.400 
header up there for pin CPU power so
that's<00:03:43.640> something<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.150> keep<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.810> probably

that's something to keep it's probably

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that's something to keep it's probably
enough<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.130> power<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:47.210> 100<00:03:47.810> watt<00:03:47.900> CPU<00:03:48.410> but<00:03:49.070> I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
enough to power a 100 watt CPU but I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
enough to power a 100 watt CPU but I
don't<00:03:49.760> know<00:03:49.910> about<00:03:50.120> how<00:03:50.690> much<00:03:50.840> power<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.410> will

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
don't know about how much power it will

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.070 
don't know about how much power it will
apply<00:03:51.950> then<00:03:52.310> for<00:03:52.550> overclocking<00:03:53.240> I<00:03:53.480> would

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
apply then for overclocking I would

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.720 
apply then for overclocking I would
imagine<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.710> four<00:03:54.950> pins<00:03:55.160> enough<00:03:55.460> but<00:03:55.640> I've

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
imagine that four pins enough but I've

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.000 
imagine that four pins enough but I've
seen<00:03:55.910> other<00:03:56.090> boards<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:56.690> an<00:03:56.930> eight<00:03:57.140> pin<00:03:57.470> so

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
seen other boards with an eight pin so

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.280 
seen other boards with an eight pin so
I'm<00:03:58.130> not<00:03:58.310> sure<00:03:58.780> personally<00:03:59.780> I'm<00:03:59.840> not<00:03:59.870> sure<00:04:00.140> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
I'm not sure personally I'm not sure the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.960 
I'm not sure personally I'm not sure the
difference<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.860> an<00:04:01.310> eight<00:04:01.460> pin<00:04:01.760> would

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
difference that an eight pin would

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.320 
difference that an eight pin would
provide<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.170> think<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.220> four<00:04:04.430> pin<00:04:04.670> would<00:04:05.000> provide

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
provide I think a four pin would provide

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.380 
provide I think a four pin would provide
enough<00:04:05.630> power<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.050> do<00:04:06.760> overclocking<00:04:07.760> but

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
enough power to do overclocking but

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.360 
enough power to do overclocking but
usually<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.350> said<00:04:09.530> we<00:04:09.650> see<00:04:09.800> an<00:04:09.920> eight<00:04:10.100> pin

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
usually like I said we see an eight pin

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.240 
usually like I said we see an eight pin
but<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.180> don't<00:04:11.360> think<00:04:11.510> that's<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.840> deal<00:04:11.990> breaker

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
but I don't think that's a deal breaker

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.200 
but I don't think that's a deal breaker
got<00:04:13.250> our<00:04:13.370> stock<00:04:13.580> at<00:04:13.730> FM<00:04:14.000> two<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:16.000> there's<00:04:17.000> our

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
got our stock at FM two and there's our

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.320 
got our stock at FM two and there's our
front<00:04:17.510> panel<00:04:17.810> audio<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.340> did<00:04:19.609> see<00:04:19.910> we<00:04:20.239> got

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
front panel audio so I did see we got

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.200 
front panel audio so I did see we got
the<00:04:20.450> CPU<00:04:20.930> fan<00:04:21.230> header<00:04:21.290> there<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.490> had<00:04:22.700> one

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
the CPU fan header there and we had one

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.150 
the CPU fan header there and we had one
system<00:04:23.750> fan<00:04:24.050> header<00:04:24.320> there<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.860> you've<00:04:24.980> got

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
system fan header there so you've got

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.110 
system fan header there so you've got
just<00:04:25.400> two<00:04:25.669> fan

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
just two fan

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.840 
just two fan
headers<00:04:26.360> unfortunately<00:04:27.080> I'm<00:04:27.410> not<00:04:27.889> it's<00:04:28.669> hard

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
headers unfortunately I'm not it's hard

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.969 
headers unfortunately I'm not it's hard
to<00:04:28.970> see<00:04:29.150> through<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.540> viewfinder<00:04:30.020> but<00:04:30.620> I

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
to see through the viewfinder but I

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.050 
to see through the viewfinder but I
definitely<00:04:31.460> don't<00:04:31.639> see<00:04:32.060> anymore<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.370> another

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
definitely don't see anymore and another

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.430 
definitely don't see anymore and another
thing<00:04:35.210> about<00:04:35.330> overclocking<00:04:35.750> with<00:04:36.110> this<00:04:36.260> too

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
thing about overclocking with this too

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.090 
thing about overclocking with this too
you<00:04:36.710> might<00:04:36.949> without<00:04:37.760> having<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.780> V<00:04:39.050> RMS<00:04:39.260> with

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
you might without having the V RMS with

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.490 
you might without having the V RMS with
a<00:04:40.130> heatsink<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:41.240> might<00:04:41.540> be<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> good<00:04:41.990> idea<00:04:42.169> not

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
a heatsink it might be a good idea not

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.750 
a heatsink it might be a good idea not
to<00:04:42.560> get<00:04:42.889> too<00:04:43.040> aggressive<00:04:43.160> with<00:04:43.550> your

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
to get too aggressive with your

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.370 
to get too aggressive with your
overclocking<00:04:44.419> with<00:04:44.540> this<00:04:44.690> board<00:04:44.930> anyway<00:04:45.350> I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
overclocking with this board anyway I

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.010 
overclocking with this board anyway I
think<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.830> would<00:04:45.949> be<00:04:46.070> better<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.840> know<00:04:47.930> I'm

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
think it would be better to you know I'm

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.219 
think it would be better to you know I'm
kind<00:04:48.229> of<00:04:48.260> surprised<00:04:48.650> for<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.070> an<00:04:49.360> 85<00:04:50.360> X<00:04:50.600> chipset

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
kind of surprised for it an 85 X chipset

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.460 
kind of surprised for it an 85 X chipset
that<00:04:51.610> we're<00:04:52.610> not<00:04:52.760> heat<00:04:53.479> sinking<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.050> V<00:04:54.199> RMS

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
that we're not heat sinking the V RMS

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.300 
that we're not heat sinking the V RMS
but<00:04:55.750> yeah<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:56.780> would<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.139> if<00:04:57.860> you're<00:04:58.100> looking

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
but yeah I would just if you're looking

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.950 
but yeah I would just if you're looking
for<00:04:58.460> some<00:04:58.639> heavy-duty<00:04:58.970> overclocking<00:04:59.690> on<00:04:59.780> the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
for some heavy-duty overclocking on the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.680 
for some heavy-duty overclocking on the
FM<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.440> socket<00:05:00.949> I<00:05:00.979> may<00:05:01.520> look<00:05:01.729> elsewhere<00:05:02.120> just

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
FM to socket I may look elsewhere just

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.020 
FM to socket I may look elsewhere just
in<00:05:02.990> case<00:05:03.289> cuz<00:05:03.650> just<00:05:04.280> doesn't<00:05:04.729> look<00:05:04.850> like

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
in case cuz just doesn't look like

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.350 
in case cuz just doesn't look like
enough<00:05:05.180> cooling<00:05:06.460> capacity<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.910> really<00:05:08.210> get

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
enough cooling capacity to really get

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.719 
enough cooling capacity to really get
some<00:05:08.539> aggressive<00:05:08.840> overclocking<00:05:09.710> but<00:05:10.039> again

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
some aggressive overclocking but again

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.560 
some aggressive overclocking but again
that<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:10.970> my<00:05:11.090> opinion<00:05:11.570> so<00:05:12.760> moving<00:05:13.760> on<00:05:13.910> we<00:05:14.419> have

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
that is my opinion so moving on we have

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.969 
that is my opinion so moving on we have
a<00:05:14.600> PCI<00:05:15.169> Express<00:05:15.729> by<00:05:16.729> 16<00:05:17.570> slot<00:05:18.080> here<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.949> a

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
a PCI Express by 16 slot here that is a

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.659 
a PCI Express by 16 slot here that is a
2.0<00:05:19.610> we<00:05:20.360> have<00:05:20.860> adequate<00:05:21.860> spacing<00:05:22.130> there<00:05:22.520> which

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
2.0 we have adequate spacing there which

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.960 
2.0 we have adequate spacing there which
is<00:05:22.820> nice<00:05:22.970> so<00:05:23.389> definitely<00:05:24.380> could<00:05:24.669> have<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.699> dual

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
is nice so definitely could have a dual

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.120 
is nice so definitely could have a dual
slot<00:05:26.389> card<00:05:26.720> there<00:05:26.960> while<00:05:27.260> still<00:05:27.590> being<00:05:27.860> able

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
slot card there while still being able

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.730 
slot card there while still being able
to<00:05:28.310> access<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:29.000> by<00:05:29.150> one<00:05:29.419> slot<00:05:29.750> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.500> were<00:05:30.620> to

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
to access the by one slot if you were to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.950 
to access the by one slot if you were to
add<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.889> sound<00:05:31.220> card<00:05:31.460> or<00:05:31.669> something<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.210> then

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
add a sound card or something and then

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.150 
add a sound card or something and then
you<00:05:33.139> have<00:05:33.289> a<00:05:33.320> legacy<00:05:33.620> PCI<00:05:34.430> slot<00:05:34.970> there<00:05:35.419> as<00:05:35.750> well

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
you have a legacy PCI slot there as well

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.310 
you have a legacy PCI slot there as well
now<00:05:37.160> let's<00:05:37.190> take<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.669> look<00:05:37.970> at<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.570> front<00:05:39.050> or

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
now let's take a look at the front or

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.050 
now let's take a look at the front or
excuse<00:05:39.710> me<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.889> rear<00:05:40.250> i/o<00:05:41.050> okay<00:05:42.050> we've<00:05:42.229> got<00:05:42.440> a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
excuse me the rear i/o okay we've got a

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.570 
excuse me the rear i/o okay we've got a
USB<00:05:44.060> 2.0<00:05:44.720> mouse<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.320> keyboard<00:05:46.419> HDMI<00:05:47.470> VGA

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
USB 2.0 mouse and keyboard HDMI VGA

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.719 
USB 2.0 mouse and keyboard HDMI VGA
those<00:05:49.580> will<00:05:49.760> be<00:05:49.849> provided<00:05:50.270> by<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.419> APU<00:05:50.960> and

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
those will be provided by the APU and

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.400 
those will be provided by the APU and
two<00:05:52.729> USB<00:05:53.479> 3.0<00:05:54.320> two<00:05:55.039> USB<00:05:55.820> 2.0<00:05:56.510> our<00:05:56.720> Gigabit

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
two USB 3.0 two USB 2.0 our Gigabit

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.029 
two USB 3.0 two USB 2.0 our Gigabit
Ethernet<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.949> then<00:05:58.280> three<00:05:59.680> outputs<00:06:00.680> for

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
Ethernet and then three outputs for

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.200 
Ethernet and then three outputs for
audio<00:06:02.440> so<00:06:03.440> that<00:06:03.680> will<00:06:03.979> kind<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:04.639> wrap<00:06:04.849> up<00:06:04.880> I

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
audio so that will kind of wrap up I

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.379 
audio so that will kind of wrap up I
would<00:06:05.419> call<00:06:05.720> this<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.349> a<00:06:07.000> budget

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
would call this a a budget

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.820 
would call this a a budget
well<00:06:08.900> yeah<00:06:09.260> it's<00:06:09.410> probably<00:06:09.560> yeah<00:06:09.949> budget<00:06:10.849> a<00:06:11.000> 85

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
well yeah it's probably yeah budget a 85

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.070 
well yeah it's probably yeah budget a 85
X<00:06:12.830> chipset<00:06:13.669> board<00:06:14.150> I've<00:06:14.389> definitely<00:06:14.570> seen

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
X chipset board I've definitely seen

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.140 
X chipset board I've definitely seen
boards<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.010> were<00:06:16.160> a<00:06:16.190> little<00:06:16.430> pricier<00:06:16.940> with

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
boards that were a little pricier with

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.870 
boards that were a little pricier with
this<00:06:17.330> chipset<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:17.960> then<00:06:18.440> they<00:06:18.590> have<00:06:19.130> more

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
this chipset and then they have more

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.950 
this chipset and then they have more
features<00:06:20.360> like<00:06:20.630> more<00:06:20.930> USB<00:06:21.530> 2.0<00:06:22.160> ports<00:06:22.960> they've

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
features like more USB 2.0 ports they've

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.469 
features like more USB 2.0 ports they've
got<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.380> VRM<00:06:24.949> eat<00:06:25.220> sync<00:06:25.610> stuff<00:06:26.030> like<00:06:26.240> that

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
got the VRM eat sync stuff like that

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.230 
got the VRM eat sync stuff like that
eight<00:06:26.990> pin<00:06:27.410> CPU<00:06:27.949> powers<00:06:28.669> so<00:06:28.910> this<00:06:29.060> is

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
eight pin CPU powers so this is

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.540 
eight pin CPU powers so this is
definitely<00:06:29.539> in<00:06:30.289> my<00:06:30.349> opinion<00:06:30.620> on<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.340> lower

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
definitely in my opinion on the lower

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.209 
definitely in my opinion on the lower
end<00:06:31.880> of<00:06:32.090> an<00:06:32.240> 85<00:06:32.780> X<00:06:33.199> chipset<00:06:33.770> it's<00:06:33.919> just<00:06:34.099> like

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
end of an 85 X chipset it's just like

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.730 
end of an 85 X chipset it's just like
it's<00:06:34.370> got<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.610> chipset<00:06:35.060> but<00:06:35.240> not<00:06:35.930> quite<00:06:36.469> all

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
it's got the chipset but not quite all

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.570 
it's got the chipset but not quite all
the<00:06:36.919> features<00:06:37.340> that<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.580> would<00:06:37.909> be<00:06:38.030> looking

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
the features that I would be looking

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.200 
the features that I would be looking
or<00:06:38.699> in<00:06:38.939> like<00:06:39.599> a<00:06:39.629> performance<00:06:40.470> motherboard<00:06:41.430> but

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
or in like a performance motherboard but

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.820 
or in like a performance motherboard but
that<00:06:42.509> being<00:06:42.750> said<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:43.080> still<00:06:43.470> think<00:06:43.650> it's<00:06:43.770> a

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
that being said I still think it's a

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.860 
that being said I still think it's a
great<00:06:44.039> board<00:06:44.310> for<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.669> price<00:06:44.879> if<00:06:45.150> you're<00:06:45.330> you

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
great board for the price if you're you

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.850 
great board for the price if you're you
know<00:06:45.900> you're<00:06:46.110> gonna<00:06:46.199> go<00:06:46.409> with<00:06:46.590> an<00:06:46.710> a8

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
know you're gonna go with an a8

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.369 
know you're gonna go with an a8
processor<00:06:47.280> and<00:06:48.000> not<00:06:48.240> really<00:06:48.629> have<00:06:48.840> to<00:06:48.990> you

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379 
processor and not really have to you

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.200 
processor and not really have to you
know<00:06:49.580> overclock<00:06:50.580> it<00:06:50.610> or<00:06:50.879> anything<00:06:51.000> like<00:06:51.090> that

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
know overclock it or anything like that

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.240 
know overclock it or anything like that
I<00:06:51.389> think<00:06:51.539> it<00:06:51.780> would<00:06:51.930> do<00:06:52.050> great<00:06:52.259> but<00:06:53.009> I<00:06:53.039> would

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
I think it would do great but I would

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.980 
I think it would do great but I would
probably<00:06:53.400> look<00:06:53.669> elsewhere<00:06:54.000> if<00:06:54.270> you're<00:06:54.479> you

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
probably look elsewhere if you're you

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.080 
probably look elsewhere if you're you
know<00:06:55.050> heavy<00:06:55.439> overclocker<00:06:56.009> and<00:06:56.550> you<00:06:56.729> want<00:06:56.969> to

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
know heavy overclocker and you want to

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.119 
know heavy overclocker and you want to
you<00:06:57.389> know<00:06:57.479> do<00:06:57.719> some<00:06:57.900> insane<00:06:58.289> things<00:06:58.620> with<00:06:58.889> the

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
you know do some insane things with the

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.249 
you know do some insane things with the
processor<00:07:00.060> then<00:07:00.479> it<00:07:00.659> might<00:07:00.810> be<00:07:00.840> better<00:07:01.139> to

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 
processor then it might be better to

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:03.230 
processor then it might be better to
find<00:07:01.889> a<00:07:02.039> board<00:07:02.250> with<00:07:02.400> a<00:07:02.430> little<00:07:02.580> more<00:07:02.819> features

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
find a board with a little more features

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.540 
find a board with a little more features
in<00:07:03.479> the<00:07:03.719> cooling<00:07:04.229> and<00:07:04.409> power<00:07:04.949> delivery

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
in the cooling and power delivery

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.309 
in the cooling and power delivery
department<00:07:06.199> so<00:07:07.199> that<00:07:07.500> wraps<00:07:08.400> up<00:07:08.669> the<00:07:09.319> unboxing

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
department so that wraps up the unboxing

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.200 
department so that wraps up the unboxing
of<00:07:10.500> this<00:07:10.740> hifi<00:07:11.990> a85<00:07:12.990> you<00:07:13.830> know<00:07:13.949> what<00:07:14.099> it<00:07:14.849> is<00:07:15.000> a

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
of this hifi a85 you know what it is a

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.230 
of this hifi a85 you know what it is a
8/5<00:07:15.900> s3<00:07:16.530> okay<00:07:16.949> I<00:07:16.979> was<00:07:17.219> right<00:07:17.400> I<00:07:17.460> thought<00:07:17.669> for<00:07:18.210> a

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
8/5 s3 okay I was right I thought for a

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.640 
8/5 s3 okay I was right I thought for a
second<00:07:18.539> oh<00:07:18.599> my<00:07:18.780> god<00:07:18.960> almost<00:07:19.289> looks<00:07:19.500> like<00:07:19.560> a

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
second oh my god almost looks like a
