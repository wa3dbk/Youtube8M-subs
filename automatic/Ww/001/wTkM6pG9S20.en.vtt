00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.410
 it's a pleasure for me today to be able 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.780
 show us a little of my life and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.360
 show you a little of my career 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 I'm paying a visit to an athlete 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.660
 who advised that it is larissa de reis here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.660
 In Las Vegas 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.000

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.000
 two 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.199
 4 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 Larisa has a lot of coaches and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 it's the best you can do because you can not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 When it comes to Spain it is clear with 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.680
 who will train when he needs and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 I was stuck and I started a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.479
 person once my this trip 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.750
 we are here now in las vegas is for 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.549
 here in las vegas riding the with 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.549
 larissa race a privilege 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.039
 my first objective was to work for the 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.409
 muscular magazine of belo men I was two 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.659
 years working for it and after 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.700
 those two years we decided to bring the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.600
 publication for Spain that is already a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 reality 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.250
 is a magazine that sells a lot in 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 us all the professionals are 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.340
 within what is its content and all 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.110
 the first line coaches 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 they write their articles for good 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.629
 that all of us can learn and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.700
 keep seeing what is the trajectory 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.700
 of each of the professional athletes 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.470
 I am a coach I am an expert in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.560
 I have a nutrition technique 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.800
 focused with a training system 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.340
 we review what she is doing 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.780
 initially and I see that we can improve it 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.940
 and pick up a little what is the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.530
