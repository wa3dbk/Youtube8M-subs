00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you can actually make this work I've had

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
you can actually make this work I've had
this<00:00:46.680> tank<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.160> about<00:00:47.340> four<00:00:47.550> months<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this tank for about four months and I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
this tank for about four months and I
haven't<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> single<00:00:48.989> guppy<00:00:49.440> killed<00:00:49.710> and

haven't had a single guppy killed and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.369 
haven't had a single guppy killed and
this<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> mostly<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> very

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this is mostly because this is a very

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
this is mostly because this is a very
heavily<00:00:52.649> planted<00:00:53.399> tank<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.539> are<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> lot

of plants the Guppies can always hide

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.959 
of plants the Guppies can always hide
and<00:00:58.410> run<00:00:58.500> away<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.980> fish<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.430> also<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and run away from the fish but also the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
and run away from the fish but also the
betta<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.539> very<00:01:00.780> interested<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of your tank you can get real plants but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
of your tank you can get real plants but
you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.920> fake<00:01:20.189> plants<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.759> long<00:01:20.909> as

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you can also get fake plants as long as

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
you can also get fake plants as long as
you<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.240> enough<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.049> fish<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> have

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you get enough for your fish to have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
you get enough for your fish to have
hiding<00:01:22.799> places<00:01:23.360> also<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> tank<00:01:24.869> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
hiding places also if your that tank is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
hiding places also if your that tank is
very<00:01:25.200> big<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.070> fish<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.490> less<00:01:27.060> likely<00:01:27.479> be

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
very big the fish will less likely be

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
very big the fish will less likely be
territorial<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.250> attack

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
territorial and will not want to attack

your<00:01:29.880> Guppies<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.750> important<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
your Guppies which is very important so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
your Guppies which is very important so
try<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> minimum<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.689> 10<00:01:34.020> gallons<00:01:34.439> if

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
try to get a minimum of 10 gallons if

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.780 
try to get a minimum of 10 gallons if
you<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> smaller<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.310> 10<00:01:35.490> gallon<00:01:35.759> tank

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you get a smaller than 10 gallon tank

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690 
you get a smaller than 10 gallon tank
this<00:01:36.450> might<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.780> work<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> 20<00:01:38.579> gallon

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this might not work I got a 20 gallon

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.749 
this might not work I got a 20 gallon
tank<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.009> worked<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.579> me

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
tank and worked out pretty well for me

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
tank and worked out pretty well for me
because<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> fish<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.840> enough<00:01:43.350> space<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
because the fish have enough space to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
because the fish have enough space to
swim<00:01:44.189> around<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.119> their<00:01:45.360> own

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
swim around and all have their own

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
swim around and all have their own
personal<00:01:45.930> space<00:01:47.960> when<00:01:48.960> planning<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> community

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
personal space when planning a community

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
personal space when planning a community
tank<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.970> fish<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
tank I would get your fish that you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
tank I would get your fish that you
would<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> keep<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.439> your<00:01:52.530> betta<00:01:52.770> first

so then they can get acclimated to the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.399 
so then they can get acclimated to the
tank<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> stress<00:01:57.090> free<00:01:57.570> way<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
tank and it stress free way this is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.899 
tank and it stress free way this is
because<00:01:58.710> even<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.579> calm

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
because even if you get a very calm

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
because even if you get a very calm
betta<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.450> doesn't<00:02:00.719> necessarily<00:02:00.899> hurt<00:02:01.649> your

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
betta that doesn't necessarily hurt your

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
betta that doesn't necessarily hurt your
fish<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.670> mine<00:02:02.939> he<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:03.509> chases<00:02:03.719> them

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
fish like mine he still chases them

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.420 
fish like mine he still chases them
around<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.469> little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.100> could<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
around a little bit and that could be a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340 
around a little bit and that could be a
little<00:02:05.640> too<00:02:05.880> stressful<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.990> fish<00:02:07.200> if

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
little too stressful for your fish if

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
little too stressful for your fish if
you<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.280> tank<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> then

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you just put them in the tank and then

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.249 
you just put them in the tank and then
as<00:02:09.179> soon<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> tank<00:02:10.080> they're

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
as soon as they get in a tank they're

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.390 
as soon as they get in a tank they're
chased<00:02:10.530> around<00:02:10.709> by<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.069> crazy<00:02:11.430> fish

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
chased around by this crazy fish

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.710 
chased around by this crazy fish
so<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.970> better<00:02:13.120> if<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.540> them

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
so it's a little better if you got them

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.750 
so it's a little better if you got them
first<00:02:13.930> also<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.709> lot<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.890> people<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.280> asked<00:02:15.610> me

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
first also a lot of people have asked me

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.229 
first also a lot of people have asked me
if<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.540> put<00:02:17.010> goldfish<00:02:18.010> with<00:02:18.280> bettas<00:02:19.000> and

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
if you can put goldfish with bettas and

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.880 
if you can put goldfish with bettas and
that<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.629> no<00:02:19.959> because<00:02:20.200> goldfish<00:02:20.739> are

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
that is no because goldfish are

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.710 
that is no because goldfish are
Coldwater<00:02:21.430> fish<00:02:21.640> they<00:02:21.879> like<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.209> water<00:02:22.540> a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
Coldwater fish they like to water a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.800 
Coldwater fish they like to water a
little<00:02:23.019> colder<00:02:23.379> around<00:02:24.450> 68<00:02:25.450> degrees<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
little colder around 68 degrees and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.509 
little colder around 68 degrees and
bettas<00:02:28.810> our<00:02:29.079> warm<00:02:29.590> water<00:02:29.829> fish<00:02:30.099> where<00:02:30.370> they

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
bettas our warm water fish where they

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.490 
bettas our warm water fish where they
like<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.849> get<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.329> their<00:02:31.480> water<00:02:31.659> at<00:02:31.870> 78

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
like to get have their water at 78

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
like to get have their water at 78
sometimes<00:02:33.190> even<00:02:33.430> 80<00:02:33.670> degrees<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.840> kind

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
sometimes even 80 degrees and that kind

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.050 
sometimes even 80 degrees and that kind
of<00:02:35.200> temperature<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:36.069> make<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.519> goldfish

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
of temperature can make the goldfish

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.819 
of temperature can make the goldfish
sick<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.659> it<00:02:37.870> wouldn't<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.530> idea<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
sick so it wouldn't be a good idea to

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.330 
sick so it wouldn't be a good idea to
put<00:02:39.069> them<00:02:39.190> together

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
put them together

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.680 
put them together
also<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.489> plan<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.790> getting<00:02:43.000> female<00:02:43.510> but

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
also if you plan on getting female but

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.720 
also if you plan on getting female but
us<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.049> wouldn't<00:02:44.500> advise<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.190> keep<00:02:45.370> them<00:02:45.549> with

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
us I wouldn't advise to keep them with

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.539 
us I wouldn't advise to keep them with
Guppies<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.629> it<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:46.959> kind<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.769> tricky<00:02:48.519> to

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
Guppies because it is kind of tricky to

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.660 
Guppies because it is kind of tricky to
keep<00:02:48.879> them<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.209> Guppies<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.750> would<00:02:50.590> get<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.980> lot

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
keep them with Guppies I would get a lot

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.940 
keep them with Guppies I would get a lot
of<00:02:51.819> female<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:52.299> us<00:02:52.480> probably<00:02:53.049> like<00:02:53.260> 5<00:02:53.739> or<00:02:53.769> 6

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
of female but us probably like 5 or 6

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.130 
of female but us probably like 5 or 6
because<00:02:54.549> if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:54.910> less<00:02:55.180> they<00:02:55.450> will<00:02:55.480> kind

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
because if you get less they will kind

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.170 
because if you get less they will kind
of<00:02:56.260> fight<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.430> want<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:57.730> more<00:02:57.970> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
of fight so you want to get more the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.729 
of fight so you want to get more the
thing<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.480> bettas<00:02:58.840> will<00:02:58.989> always<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.440> slightly

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
thing is bettas will always be slightly

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.069 
thing is bettas will always be slightly
aggressive<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:01.239> more<00:03:01.420> fish<00:03:01.629> you<00:03:01.659> have<00:03:01.930> in

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
aggressive and the more fish you have in

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.899 
aggressive and the more fish you have in
a<00:03:02.170> bigger<00:03:02.349> tank<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.980> more<00:03:03.250> spread<00:03:03.640> out<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
a bigger tank that more spread out the

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.539 
a bigger tank that more spread out the
aggression<00:03:04.359> is<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.930> just<00:03:05.109> ends<00:03:05.920> up<00:03:06.159> in<00:03:06.400> them

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
aggression is so it just ends up in them

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.339 
aggression is so it just ends up in them
chasing<00:03:06.970> each<00:03:07.030> other<00:03:07.239> maybe<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.690> nipper<00:03:07.989> too

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
chasing each other maybe a nipper too

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.319 
chasing each other maybe a nipper too
and<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.190> fish<00:03:09.370> won't<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.760> hurt<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.209> they'll

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
and the fish won't be hurt and they'll

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.819 
and the fish won't be hurt and they'll
be<00:03:10.450> perfectly<00:03:10.870> fine<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.349> that's<00:03:11.470> how<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.650> can

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
be perfectly fine and that's how you can

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.160 
be perfectly fine and that's how you can
make<00:03:12.129> that<00:03:12.340> tank<00:03:12.609> work<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.180> fish<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.109> you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
make that tank work and fish that you

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.470 
make that tank work and fish that you
can<00:03:14.319> keep<00:03:14.560> with<00:03:14.829> female<00:03:15.250> Bettis<00:03:15.609> in<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.239> group

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
can keep with female Bettis in a group

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.809 
can keep with female Bettis in a group
would<00:03:16.930> be<00:03:16.989> tetras<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.010> large<00:03:18.220> group<00:03:18.430> because

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
would be tetras in a large group because

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.289 
would be tetras in a large group because
the<00:03:18.970> tetras<00:03:19.359> would<00:03:19.569> feel<00:03:19.780> secure<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:21.609> school

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
the tetras would feel secure in a school

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.069 
the tetras would feel secure in a school
a<00:03:22.540> fish<00:03:23.319> but<00:03:23.739> also<00:03:23.799> at<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.190> same<00:03:24.400> time<00:03:25.079> they

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
a fish but also at the same time they

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.420 
a fish but also at the same time they
can<00:03:26.260> swim<00:03:26.470> very<00:03:26.560> quickly<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.220> they<00:03:27.340> actually

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
can swim very quickly so they actually

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.569 
can swim very quickly so they actually
can't<00:03:27.790> get<00:03:27.940> nipped<00:03:28.239> by<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.660> betta<00:03:29.230> unlike<00:03:30.190> my

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
can't get nipped by the betta unlike my

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.099 
can't get nipped by the betta unlike my
Guppies<00:03:31.030> who<00:03:31.269> can<00:03:31.540> get<00:03:31.750> nipped<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:34.690> setting

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
Guppies who can get nipped when setting

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.780 
Guppies who can get nipped when setting
