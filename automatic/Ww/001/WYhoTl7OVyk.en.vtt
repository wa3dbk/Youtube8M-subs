00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
am I think that probably our forwards or

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.470 
am I think that probably our forwards or
forwards<00:00:43.020> went<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.950> those<00:00:44.940> are<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
forwards went very well but those are it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
forwards went very well but those are it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.460 
kind of contributed to the loss oh I
think<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.869> both<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.200> many<00:01:34.380> are

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
think it's a bit of both on many are

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.840 
think it's a bit of both on many are
they<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.799> played<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.280> rugby<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.670> well

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
they they played some good rugby as well

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.039 
they they played some good rugby as well
and<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.150> though<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.600> would<00:01:36.750> add<00:01:36.869> some

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and you know though they would add some

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.530 
and you know though they would add some
unforced<00:01:37.439> errors<00:01:37.710> too<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> bit<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
unforced errors too so so it's a bit of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.910 
unforced errors too so so it's a bit of
both<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.840> mean<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.890> way

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
both on mean would you know we go way

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
both on mean would you know we go way
too<00:01:41.100> many<00:01:41.280> penalties<00:01:41.520> early<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> game<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
too many penalties early in the game I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
too many penalties early in the game I
think<00:01:42.659> we're<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.079> nine<00:01:43.530> before

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
think we're up to about nine before

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
think we're up to about nine before
half-time<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.790> mean<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> can't<00:01:45.450> afford<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> do

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
half-time I mean you can't afford to do

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.679 
half-time I mean you can't afford to do
that<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.490> can't<00:01:47.729> combine<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that and you know you can't combine that

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.940 
that and you know you can't combine that
with<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> turnovers<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.590> did<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.890> got

swing the ball to the middle of the
field<00:02:18.580> attacked<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.150> then<00:02:19.240> put<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> over<00:02:19.990> our

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.200 
the first half and we just needed to
come<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.190> little<00:02:24.310> bit<00:02:24.430> more<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.730> them
