they're going to be missing out on a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.250 
they're going to be missing out on a
pretty<00:04:00.739> good<00:04:00.949> game<00:04:01.220> but<00:04:01.879> hopefully<00:04:02.389> you<00:04:03.169> know

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
pretty good game but hopefully you know

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.020 
pretty good game but hopefully you know
swings<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.799> roundabouts<00:04:04.280> theoretically

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
swings and roundabouts theoretically

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.740 
swings and roundabouts theoretically
anyway<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.760> ideal<00:04:07.760> situation<00:04:08.060> as<00:04:09.370> ideal<00:04:10.370> and

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
anyway the ideal situation as ideal and

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.509 
anyway the ideal situation as ideal and
in<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:11.989> scenario<00:04:12.319> anyway<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:13.190> ideal

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
in this scenario anyway the ideal

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.990 
in this scenario anyway the ideal
situation<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.479> that<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.379> get<00:04:15.560> a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
situation is that you get a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.140 
situation is that you get a
counterbalance<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.599> yes<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.949> miss<00:04:19.190> l<00:04:19.400> on<00:04:19.639> game

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
counterbalance so yes you miss l on game

report<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.680> update<00:05:35.130> rather<00:05:35.460> than<00:05:35.700> the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
report the update rather than the

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.180

original<00:05:36.420> rumor<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.440> at<00:05:37.560> least<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.860> can<00:05:37.980> take

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
original rumor so at least we can take

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.190 
original rumor so at least we can take
some<00:05:38.400> solace<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:38.940> at<00:05:39.330> least<00:05:39.570> theory

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
some solace in that at least theory

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.980 
some solace in that at least theory
theoretically<00:05:41.210> loool<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.480> up<00:05:42.570> having<00:05:42.840> one<00:05:42.960> of

theoretically loool it up having one of
those<00:05:43.110> days<00:05:43.350> i<00:05:43.410> think<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:43.770> because<00:05:43.860> my<00:05:43.980> brain

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790

you've almost drops his own microphone
which<00:06:07.260> is<00:06:07.410> about<00:06:07.650> as<00:06:07.800> professional<00:06:08.370> as<00:06:08.490> you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
which is about as professional as you

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.930 
which is about as professional as you
can<00:06:08.760> get<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:10.260> is<00:06:10.620> well<00:06:11.220> technically<00:06:11.760> I'm

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
can get that is well technically I'm

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.820 
can get that is well technically I'm
more<00:06:12.120> drag<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:12.780> microphone<00:06:13.380> off<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.650> desk

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
more drag the microphone off the desk

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.110 
more drag the microphone off the desk
with<00:06:14.010> my<00:06:14.130> foot<00:06:14.460> which<00:06:14.700> is<00:06:14.850> even<00:06:15.090> more

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
with my foot which is even more

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.330 
with my foot which is even more
Provident<00:06:15.810> well<00:06:15.960> somehow<00:06:16.290> my<00:06:16.980> foot<00:06:17.220> have

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
Provident well somehow my foot have

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.530 
Provident well somehow my foot have
become<00:06:17.640> encapsulated<00:06:18.570> in<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.960> wire<00:06:20.390> so<00:06:21.390> do

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
become encapsulated in the wire so do

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.660 
become encapsulated in the wire so do
check<00:06:21.600> that<00:06:21.960> out<00:06:21.990> if<00:06:22.110> you<00:06:22.440> so<00:06:22.620> desire<00:06:22.980> anyway

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
check that out if you so desire anyway

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.790 
check that out if you so desire anyway

stuff<00:06:33.630> there's<00:06:33.810> probably<00:06:34.050> going<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.230> be<00:06:34.290> one

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560

to<00:06:34.740> two<00:06:34.920> more<00:06:35.100> videos<00:06:35.430> on<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.640> I'm<00:06:35.910> sure<00:06:36.360> how

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
to two more videos on it I'm sure how

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.600 
to two more videos on it I'm sure how
much<00:06:36.750> more<00:06:36.810> I<00:06:37.140> want<00:06:37.170> to<00:06:37.410> cover<00:06:37.650> there's<00:06:38.490> a

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
much more I want to cover there's a

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.030 
much more I want to cover there's a
couple<00:06:38.820> of<00:06:39.000> bits<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.300> have<00:06:39.540> a<00:06:39.570> feeling

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
couple of bits I have a feeling

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.040 
couple of bits I have a feeling
maybe<00:06:40.220> pains<00:06:40.520> in<00:06:40.730> the<00:06:40.760> butt<00:06:40.850> and<00:06:41.330> by<00:06:41.570> which<00:06:41.840> I

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
maybe pains in the butt and by which I

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.300 
maybe pains in the butt and by which I
mean<00:06:42.080> that<00:06:42.500> they're<00:06:42.710> going<00:06:42.860> to<00:06:42.920> take<00:06:43.100> an

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
mean that they're going to take an

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.600 
mean that they're going to take an
inordinately<00:06:43.780> search<00:06:44.780> on<00:06:44.990> my<00:06:45.140> part<00:06:45.470> to<00:06:45.650> do<00:06:46.100> and

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
inordinately search on my part to do and

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.360 
inordinately search on my part to do and
that's<00:06:47.480> probably<00:06:47.750> going<00:06:48.170> to<00:06:48.230> mean<00:06:48.470> the<00:06:48.830> in

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
that's probably going to mean the in

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.430 
that's probably going to mean the in
conjunction<00:06:50.120> with<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.510> fact<00:06:50.720> that<00:06:50.840> if<00:06:51.110> I<00:06:51.230> have

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
conjunction with the fact that if I have

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.410 
conjunction with the fact that if I have
to<00:06:51.530> do<00:06:51.650> a<00:06:51.680> lot<00:06:51.860> of<00:06:51.920> research<00:06:52.430> typically<00:06:53.300> that

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
to do a lot of research typically that

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.420 
to do a lot of research typically that
means<00:06:53.600> i<00:06:53.870> have<00:06:53.900> to<00:06:54.050> write<00:06:54.350> a<00:06:54.410> lot<00:06:54.740> to<00:06:55.130> actually

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
means i have to write a lot to actually

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.160 
means i have to write a lot to actually
explain<00:06:55.850> it<00:06:56.060> because<00:06:56.180> here's<00:06:56.900> how<00:06:57.050> it

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
explain it because here's how it

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.450 
explain it because here's how it
basically<00:06:57.470> works<00:06:57.680> if<00:06:57.980> it's<00:06:58.160> quite

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
basically works if it's quite

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.160 
basically works if it's quite
complicated<00:06:58.790> for<00:06:59.150> me<00:06:59.180> to<00:06:59.240> learn<00:06:59.600> its<00:06:59.840> most

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
complicated for me to learn its most

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.530 
complicated for me to learn its most
likely<00:07:00.620> complicated<00:07:01.550> to<00:07:01.670> explain<00:07:01.730> it's<00:07:02.390> not

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
likely complicated to explain it's not

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.480 
likely complicated to explain it's not
always<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:03.110> case<00:07:03.140> of<00:07:03.530> girls<00:07:03.770> but<00:07:04.010> it

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
always the case of girls but it

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.670 
always the case of girls but it
generally<00:07:04.670> is<00:07:05.000> so<00:07:05.510> i<00:07:05.540> don't<00:07:05.870> want<00:07:05.990> to<00:07:06.050> just<00:07:06.200> put

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
generally is so i don't want to just put

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.020 
generally is so i don't want to just put
the<00:07:06.800> stuff<00:07:07.010> down<00:07:07.040> that<00:07:07.430> no<00:07:07.580> one<00:07:07.730> be<00:07:07.850> able<00:07:07.940> to

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
the stuff down that no one be able to

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.550 
the stuff down that no one be able to
understand<00:07:08.540> out<00:07:08.750> unless<00:07:08.870> you<00:07:09.110> do<00:07:09.230> the<00:07:09.350> same

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
understand out unless you do the same

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.560 
understand out unless you do the same
research<00:07:10.040> as<00:07:10.190> I<00:07:10.340> did<00:07:10.580> so<00:07:10.760> I<00:07:11.210> prefer<00:07:11.540> to

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
research as I did so I prefer to

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.210 
research as I did so I prefer to
actually<00:07:12.020> put<00:07:12.260> that<00:07:12.440> information<00:07:12.650> down<00:07:13.070> and

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
actually put that information down and

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.370 
actually put that information down and
break<00:07:13.460> it<00:07:13.670> down<00:07:13.880> so<00:07:14.240> it's<00:07:14.660> possible<00:07:14.930> there's

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
break it down so it's possible there's

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.070 
break it down so it's possible there's
going<00:07:15.500> to<00:07:15.560> be<00:07:15.590> two<00:07:15.890> more<00:07:16.100> parts<00:07:16.540> I<00:07:17.540> would<00:07:17.960> like

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
going to be two more parts I would like

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.020 
going to be two more parts I would like
to<00:07:18.110> go<00:07:18.320> through<00:07:18.590> the<00:07:18.740> Xbox<00:07:19.130> Live<00:07:19.340> deployment

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 
critical and crucial and if possible I'd

critical and crucial and if possible I'd
like<00:07:30.050> to<00:07:30.230> draw<00:07:30.410> some<00:07:30.620> comparisons<00:07:30.800> and<00:07:31.520> maybe

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.730

figure<00:07:32.030> out<00:07:32.210> what<00:07:32.510> we<00:07:33.500> can<00:07:33.680> use<00:07:33.710> from<00:07:34.160> that<00:07:34.400> too

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:36.850 
figure out what we can use from that too

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.200
