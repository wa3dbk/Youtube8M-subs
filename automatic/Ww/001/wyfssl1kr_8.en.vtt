liveaboards<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.600> sure<00:01:56.810> look<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
liveaboards for sure look at that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.709 
liveaboards for sure look at that
another<00:01:58.289> one<00:01:58.469> tarp<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.880> roof<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.270> couple

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
another one tarp up on the roof a couple

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.480 
another one tarp up on the roof a couple
of<00:02:00.810> frontiers<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> used<00:02:02.249> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
of frontiers it's like the one I used to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.529 
of frontiers it's like the one I used to
live<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:04.850> industrial<00:02:05.850> areas<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> are

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
live in industrial areas like this are

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.809 
live in industrial areas like this are
the<00:02:06.630> best<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.959> that<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:08.160> you're

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the best for that because if you're

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
the best for that because if you're
going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.299> in<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.479> larger<00:02:09.780> class<00:02:09.989> c<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
going to be in a larger class c or a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.690 
going to be in a larger class c or a
these<00:02:10.679> are<00:02:10.830> pretty<00:02:10.979> much<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.190> areas<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.580> have

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
these are pretty much the areas you have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.280 
these are pretty much the areas you have
to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.180> where<00:02:12.360> there's<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:13.140> all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
to be in where there's it's all

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:33.819 
to be in where there's it's all
industrial<00:02:14.720> no<00:02:15.720> one<00:02:15.870> else<00:02:15.989> around<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:32.459> right

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
hundreds 120 watt panel on the roof to
150<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> 30<00:02:59.639> watt<00:02:59.849> for<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> back<00:03:00.239> oh

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
150 this is a 30 watt for the back oh

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.180 
150 this is a 30 watt for the back oh
alright<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:03.209> new<00:03:03.329> battery<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.989> 108<00:03:04.980> amp

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
alright so the new battery is 108 amp

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.490 
alright so the new battery is 108 amp
hours<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.819> other<00:03:05.849> battery<00:03:06.269> i<00:03:06.299> have<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.630> 110<00:03:07.290> so

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
hours the other battery i have is 110 so

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.009 
hours the other battery i have is 110 so
they're<00:03:07.650> basically<00:03:07.709> identical<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.900> can

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
they're basically identical and you can

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.430 
they're basically identical and you can
see<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.319> here<00:03:10.440> sitting<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.859> my<00:03:10.980> step<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.459> now

solar let me show you what you can do so

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
solar let me show you what you can do so
instead<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.450> standard<00:03:45.510> solar<00:03:46.079> connectors

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
instead of the standard solar connectors
which<00:03:47.160> most<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.910> be<00:03:48.060> familiar<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
which most of you be familiar with this

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.619 
which most of you be familiar with this
is<00:03:49.440> 2<00:03:50.280> into<00:03:50.489> 1<00:03:50.760> right<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.150> i<00:03:51.180> already<00:03:51.359> have<00:03:51.599> a

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
is 2 into 1 right so i already have a

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.569 
is 2 into 1 right so i already have a
panel<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.200> roof<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.500> back<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.010> this

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
panel on the roof at the back and this

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.099 
panel on the roof at the back and this
one's<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:53.940> near<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.239> back<00:03:54.389> too<00:03:54.599> so<00:03:54.900> just

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
one's going near the back too so just

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.860 
one's going near the back too so just
going<00:03:55.289> to<00:03:55.350> be<00:03:55.440> able<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.739> take<00:03:55.970> both<00:03:56.970> cords<00:03:57.720> from

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
going to be able to take both cords from

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.779 
going to be able to take both cords from
both<00:03:58.139> panels<00:03:58.440> plug<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.919> into<00:03:59.039> this<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.519> then

00:03:59.779 --> 00:03:59.789 
both panels plug it into this and then

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:00.950 
both panels plug it into this and then
out<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.329> one<00:04:00.539> to<00:04:00.720> them

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
out to the one to them

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.390 
out to the one to them
mean<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> wiring<00:04:01.860> that's<00:04:02.130> already<00:04:02.310> in

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
mean this is a wiring that's already in

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.500 
mean this is a wiring that's already in
the<00:04:02.580> roof<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.880> goes<00:04:03.030> all<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.180> way<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the roof and goes all the way to the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.450 
the roof and goes all the way to the
solar<00:04:03.720> charge<00:04:03.990> controller<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.920> 2<00:04:04.980> into<00:04:05.220> one

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
solar charge controller so 2 into one

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.640 
solar charge controller so 2 into one
very<00:04:05.700> nicely<00:04:05.910> very<00:04:06.810> net<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.110> was<00:04:07.260> only<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.500> few
