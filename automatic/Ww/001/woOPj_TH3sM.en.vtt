 The fact that it gets big 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.220

 ran a lot at breakfast but how is it? 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 very quality as food for 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.230
 quality as on several occasions the last 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.789
 The average 56 meals could eat at 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 every three hours 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.930
 It's also interesting if you can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 eat like every two hours 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 but how good it is good damn good 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 today against a single game is also very 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 important many people do not have this 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.830
 in mind but it's interesting you bought 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.409
 omd because a single aid in retention 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 of water in the muscles just like you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 Supports getting big you do not have to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 that you do not care about aesthetics with 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.130
 What is the definition at that time, then? 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.900
 interesting to use this mechanism for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 play direct water with your muscles and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.720
 pants cause this swelling 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.960
 talking in water another tip also the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.009
 third tip is you drink lots of water 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.930
 enough water that the water the muscle is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.570
 composed mostly of water and water 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.720
 protein sends a lot of water 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 need to rotate also giving continuity 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.829
 and satisfactory amount of water - 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 every three hours 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.599
 in this item between one and a half hours between 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.510
 babies 15 ml of water between meals 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.069
 if you're going to have a break 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 the hours between meals that in one 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.280
 three-hour interval for babies 500ml 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.370
 of water also always intercalating 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.819
 meal passed from half water meal to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.860
 new and half water and so on 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.340
 another other technique other tip 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.140
 interesting is you if you clear your diet 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.159
 I'm talking if you cries to us. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:41.329
 to stay on your diet because it is a 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:44.030
 circus is what is changing and comes back to 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.879
 where began a circle 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.980
 in this case then for example you 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:54.620
 started eating today goes 3 thousand calories 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.310
 tomorrow you go 3 thousand and 3 thousand 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.739
 then you fall when you go up then it's 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.359
 Good thing you make this change not stay 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 always in the sameness 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.599
 because then you confuse the body confuse 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.000
 then the organism is not here and 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.220
 do not enter tied it is the stage of 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.200
 adaptation and not be adapted to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.349
 that situation you are always looking for 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.900
 a way he is always changing 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.819
 is constantly changing 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.449
 it is important that the mass gain 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.549
 muscle for you then genetics 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:30.829
 favored and so it is important to 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 also the day of garbage day you will 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.280
 listening to the shack will eat more 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.699
 because it will give this confused in the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.199
 your body and it will compensate 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.120
 the next day 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.910
 I found bodybuilding this is always 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.730
 confused the body in the diet in training 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.359
 is always looking for new mechanisms the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.209
 body and strengthening and that is 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.430
 perfect rest I mean 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.609
 with dedication you spend the day i march 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.449
 slow to get the wettest laziness 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.340
 I well 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:08.090
 sunday quality and this is very 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.979
 important because during much sleep 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.909
 pride is expected in your body 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:16.760
 Human creciente and seven goals and should have 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.549
 have read somewhere that the body 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.370
 grow a rest and it really is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.300
 happens when you train the fibers 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.300
 the muscle fiber was destroyed and in the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.110
 rest rebuilds only rebuilds 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.870
 strengthened and bigger with more protein and 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.220
 more water between the victory goes always 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.410
 Growing up, I'm looking for growth. 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.110
 You find out later to repair roads. 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.090
 then repair you knock home to 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.350
 then build the most beautiful and most 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.970
 strong 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.880
 It's more or less so, so it's 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.220
 It's interesting that you take well to sleep with 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 quality without interruptions 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.190
 a quiet and comfortable place for you 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.120
 who is hurt and wants to gain a lot of weight 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.370
 muscular 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.639
 It's also interesting that you stop with 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.870
 erotic in any way for 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.660
 to run 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.460
 if you do parallel sports it is 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.300
 interesting we have to stop 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.880
 that you will feel the change in the hour 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.370
 If you do run, swim, play soccer. 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.389
 It's good that you stop or reduce 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.820
 these wells parallel the europium 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.099
 do treadmill if a scenario 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.780
 I'm a mirror, you want but you do not have to 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.570
 What are you running on the mat? 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.800
 if it's getting heavy I should both 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.260
 weight and not pedro iron and that's what you 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.900
 You have to do to get to loading cargo 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.270
 damn, destroy, get out of there 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.300
 wheelchair puts the last tip 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.740
 intensity interferes with keeping workout 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.930
 always the footprint get focused during 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.449
 that that 50 minutes an hour from 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.270
 training give your maximum and always seek 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.570
 take a step forward in the charges you 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.539
 like 50 mothers you put 60 and so on 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.789
 successively is always changing the 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.780
 training or make a video about techniques 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.370
 always confusing the body that this is the 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.070
 key 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.070
 A hug was shared with the next one.
