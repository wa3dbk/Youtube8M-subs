00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.540
 i 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 I have always said that I would love 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
 do some action movie 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 Tarantino is one of my directors 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 favorites and I would love to do something 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.770
 that style I do not know at the end of the record 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 how he works with everything he knows 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.790
 so take advantage of that I like the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.140
 sport and everything physical so to 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.140
 play a role like that I would love 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.640
 it's true that I have little time 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.610
 little time but I think all the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.650
 world takes time out of the case lead 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.690
 Some slippers go where you go and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.840
 to be able to run down the street and 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.490
 now not because the girl is more 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.560
 big but when it was a little bit more 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.570
 I would take her to run to the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
 retirement and I was already in the cart 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.410
 directly he gets to sleep he finds out about 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 I was going nowhere and that is pushing very 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.740
 good exercise 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.560
 if not 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.780
 I lived in my house with my 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.210
 brother who has always been very 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.440
 athlete and such but I think that at 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.290
 final this a little whatever you go 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.250
 inculcating and you can always take time 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.400
 from wherever it is to do sports 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.080
 I think time is taking it out 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.020
 because if something you really like it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.380
 you try to adapt to the environment to be able 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 do what 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.510
 I have concrete with a single lamb like 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.190
 we were both the winners of the night 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470
 both men and us two and said 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.930
 Well, he launched this challenge to make a 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.150
 fiat long 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.769
 maybe it was a bit of a way 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.819
 do that I got to do that challenge 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.760
 because maybe yes but like that you 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.780
 you're proposing and you never do and if 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.640
 I really want to do it 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.920
 I still do not start training but hey 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.069
 little by little with the time of the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.069
 triathlons 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.360
 more June spring and spring summer 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.360
 then to start 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 ah
