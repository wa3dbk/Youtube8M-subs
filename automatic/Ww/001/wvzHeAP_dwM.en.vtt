00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi girls until you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome to my channel then 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.640
 I find you today for a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
 tuto hairstyle that throws a max 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.900
 it's a bun super easy to make 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 but which is especially embellished with a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
 maxi super nice braid that I did 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.020
 face on African haste you're going 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 immediately see the tutorial he is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.840
 really very very simple and he 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.119
 especially does not require a lot of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 material so I used some powder 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 wanted me from at bamboo style who 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 so lets achieve this maxi 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.420
 also braids flat tongs and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 small elastics from monop 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 so we'll start by taking a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 section of hair that leaves from above 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 the head and that goes right behind the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
 ears 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.969
 we take the rest of the hair and we 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 attach as you can see so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 it's well delineated from the top of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.219
 head to behind the ears 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 so as you can see I did not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.250
 not made my roots of course I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.250
 did not have time but that would not 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 delay the parenthesis of the roots being 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 finished now so you brush 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.739
 your hair that's great 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 importantly you must have none evo 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.370
 flap and where on one side the side that you 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.379
 so prefer from the side of view she 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 you feel more comfortable and there 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.540
 you take three sections of hair and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 you braided in a very African way in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 folding the ends of the ends 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 in the middle from below is so at 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 each time to add a wick to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 middle be it by the left or by 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 the right you add a pitcher of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 free metz and therefore the more you are 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.140
 more the braid will take volume and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.280
 so you will taste it until 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.759
 that there is no more free mach 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.680
 simply 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.210
 and when you caught all the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 wicks you continue in braid 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 classic that you're going attached with a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.189
 little rubber band that comes 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.450
 the solution especially from monop you 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.040
 so you end up with a truce that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.150
 part of an ear and that goes to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.220
 the other and that ends in 13 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 classic so it takes all the above 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.909
 of the head 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.800
 so then I just click the powder 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.050
 bamboo style for volume 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.880
 and this max that braid that is not 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
 still a maxi braid so I put 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 everywhere everywhere on the top braid 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 down 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 then I'm going to come and pat history 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.330
 which is no white traces because 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.650
 this product there when we do not tap it 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.630
 leave ugly white traces not 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.720
 beautiful at all so the texture is the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.430
 hair and that makes it possible to make 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.200
 braid a maxi braid so like you 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.330
 can see it I went down the elastic 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 to leave a little slack and so 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.220
 I'm coming to shoot the strands of the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.290
 braid so that they grow bigger than she 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 become flatter and much more 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 wide so I'm doing it from the bottom and I 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.290
 goes back to the top and I do it on 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.080
 all the braid is so now you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.050
 do you have a super nice maxi braid you 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.540
 go take all your hair all the way 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.610
 mass so that's free and you go 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.860
 fold everything down on one side 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.700
 side of the press 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.380
 then you will realize a little 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.510
 simple swirl bun you 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.160
 take you wind as you go 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 where you enlist you come to position 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 the flat clamps will pliers bun 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.360
 forgiveness all around in order to secure the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.100
 bun and who does not get rid of and who 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.580
 especially hold all day where 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.590
 all evening and so to finish I 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.450
 will come accessorized this little bun 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
 very simple with a super nice and strips 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 who comes from secret stones that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.709
 I have since eternity and who is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.209
 superb 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.670
 so the benefits of his feet in front 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.230
 it sells is that the elastic 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.790
 really should be there to cut 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.840
 heads only little snag it's not the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.819
 color of her hair that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.370
 but it does not matter the headband is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.269
