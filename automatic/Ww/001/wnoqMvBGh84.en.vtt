00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.139
 hey i am very beautiful that you will be back 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.039
 to be there 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 today it is about central dogma of 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.190
 Molecular Biology has a great name 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.470
 not so complicated behind that 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.480
 there once said that we starting from 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 the dna a description in the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 messenger rna and from there to then 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.059
 get protein that is actually the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.960
 entire statement of the inside is but 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 more so we want a bit 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.739
 watch out so we have our dna 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.649
 On it we have our plan of the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.350
 This body is now over the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 process of transaction to one 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.569
 certain part read to which 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.339
 divide 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.899
 that depends on which protein 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.139
 can be at the exit be it like that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 a certain part of the dna read and 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:03.719
 this one part is called messenger rna then 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 messenger because it's just a messenger 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.900
 is the one that brings the part of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.410
 Message we for our last 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.530
 need product and that will turn 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.570
 read it again and in the process 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.410
 a protein is produced 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 in the process of the transaction and that's it 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.230
 what the central but only said, 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.050
 though that's not just this 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.130
 order what is then only from 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.510
 the proximity to the protein 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 When I go back we can not get protein 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.430
 that will be unwritten then so 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.710
 the protein will create a blueprint 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.660
 and this part of the building plan will be in the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 total plan of the body installed 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.910
 this is not the only way it works 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.710
 the one part step backwards 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.360
 I can take these viruses 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.480
 this step 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.420
 You can choose from a part of a part 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.150
 to restore information to dna 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.860
 example cause the viruses 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.390
 can something then build their 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.320
 information you in the form of rna 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.289
 have as dna in our body cells 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.019
 and bring our cells would be 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.930
 to produce then again from 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.859
 sufficient and others 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.269
 but one thing is that that is that 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.390
 the basic bill that one 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.519
 except what you get for protein maybe 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.049
 should still know that is out 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.189
 basic units consist of the 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:35.609
 so-called amino acids recently with 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:38.379
 sap and an amino acid alone 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.859
 relatively small we can do this whole 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.569
 but we can bring in a chain 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.760
 So several amino acids in a row 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.129
 link 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.780
 this is called a peptide bond and 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.189
 we have 20 different menus at the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 means we also have a relative 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.169
 selection and from a certain number of 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.739
 amino acids is the name of the peptide 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.669
 So if we have 9 from 9 amino acids 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.579
 we call this one after the other 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:07.150
 Whole molecule is what creates polio 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.519
 peptide and if we still have it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.469
 More have up to 99 amino acids 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.739
 one after the other then the poly is called 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:17.019
 peptide and if we still have more left 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.870
 more - an interval then we have 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.449
 proteins and that are ultimately ours 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.419
 functional units in the body that 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.370
 what is coded by the dna 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.379
 I hope I could continue with it 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.650
 Help a lot of success while learning to 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.650
 next
