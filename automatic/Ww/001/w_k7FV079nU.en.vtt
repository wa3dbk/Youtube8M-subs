from<00:01:23.520> our<00:01:23.670> side<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> other

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
from our side but I think all the other

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
from our side but I think all the other
operating<00:01:25.680> companies<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.640> the
