00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
that's me you Raymond and Zach I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.250 
that's me you Raymond and Zach I
couldn't<00:00:38.790> remember<00:00:39.090> who<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> guess<00:00:40.110> was

couldn't remember who you I guess was

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410 
couldn't remember who you I guess was
referring<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> Tom<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.460> probably<00:00:41.820> refers<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
referring to Tom it probably refers to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
referring to Tom it probably refers to
Tom<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> most<00:00:43.140> he<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.680> most<00:00:44.280> involved<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
eSports tech may have a hope I don't

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.799

think<00:00:47.640> Raymond<00:00:47.940> gives<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.300> shits<00:00:48.600> about

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
think Raymond gives any shits about

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.299 
think Raymond gives any shits about
eSports<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> talk<00:00:50.280> about

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
eSports what I want to talk about

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
eSports what I want to talk about
specifically<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> Korean<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> European

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
specifically is the Korean and European

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
specifically is the Korean and European
dominance<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> League<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> Legends<00:00:55.140> zone

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
dominance of the League of Legends zone

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
dominance of the League of Legends zone
really<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.399> look<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.300> just

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really if you look at it it's not just

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
really if you look at it it's not just
legal<00:00:58.440> legend<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> starcraft

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
legal legend there's also the starcraft

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700 
legal legend there's also the starcraft
dominance<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> guess<00:01:00.870> Koreans<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.500> have

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
dominance I guess Koreans don't have

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
dominance I guess Koreans don't have

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
job of taking games off top to your
teams<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.759> closeness<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.170> me

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
teams with now the closeness of it to me

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
teams with now the closeness of it to me
always<00:01:49.829> dictates<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.970> competitive<00:01:51.420> scene

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
always dictates a more competitive scene

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.710 
always dictates a more competitive scene
so<00:01:52.350> Europe<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.790> more<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so Europe right now has a lot more of a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
so Europe right now has a lot more of a
competitive<00:01:55.320> scene<00:01:55.530> than<00:01:55.829> North<00:01:56.040> America<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
competitive scene than North America the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
competitive scene than North America the
curse<00:01:56.939> dignitas<00:01:57.719> TSM<00:01:58.439> they're<00:01:58.770> able<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
curse dignitas TSM they're able to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.459 
curse dignitas TSM they're able to
pretty<00:01:59.460> easily<00:01:59.729> handle<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.750> lower<00:02:00.960> tier<00:02:01.200> team

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
pretty easily handle the lower tier team

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
pretty easily handle the lower tier team
yes<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.640> guys<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:03.000> point<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
yes I know you guys will point out that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
yes I know you guys will point out that
they've<00:02:03.899> lost<00:02:04.200> against<00:02:04.770> these<00:02:04.920> teams<00:02:05.130> before

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
they've lost against these teams before

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
they've lost against these teams before
I<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.240> venture<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> say<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I would venture to say that that is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.160 
I would venture to say that that is
really<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:08.039> curse<00:02:08.520> TSM<00:02:09.450> dignitas

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
really just because curse TSM dignitas

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.140 
really just because curse TSM dignitas
they<00:02:10.379> didn't<00:02:10.709> perform<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:11.580> they

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
they didn't perform really well they

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.730 
they didn't perform really well they
underestimated<00:02:12.930> their<00:02:13.230> opponents

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
underestimated their opponents

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.130 
underestimated their opponents
sure<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.730> teams<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.210> complexity<00:02:15.930> are

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
sure I think teams like complexity are

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.380 
sure I think teams like complexity are
doing<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> pretty<00:02:16.740> good<00:02:16.860> job<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.400> rising<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.180> I'm

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
doing a pretty good job of rising up I'm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.230 
doing a pretty good job of rising up I'm
becoming<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.470> tier<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.160> team<00:02:20.520> do<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.000> think

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
becoming a more tier one team do I think

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.300 
becoming a more tier one team do I think
that<00:02:21.510> complexity<00:02:22.110> stands<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.680> chance<00:02:22.710> against

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that complexity stands a chance against

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.700 
that complexity stands a chance against
TSMC<00:02:23.970> or<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.170> complexity

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
TSMC or do I think that complexity

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.640 
TSMC or do I think that complexity
stands<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.310> chance<00:02:26.340> against<00:02:27.000> dignitas<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:28.590> I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
stands a chance against dignitas do I

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.140 
stands a chance against dignitas do I
think<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:28.980> complexity<00:02:29.520> stands<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> chance

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
think that complexity stands a chance

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.700
