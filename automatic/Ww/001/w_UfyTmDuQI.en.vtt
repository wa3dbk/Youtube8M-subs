and then you have some clarified butter

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880 
and then you have some clarified butter
and<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.939> happens<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:34.650> the

bring on high heat and and that butter
is<00:01:48.210> basically<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.570> come<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> boil<00:01:49.310> as

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is basically gonna come up to a boil as

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.460 
is basically gonna come up to a boil as
soon<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> comes<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> boil<00:01:52.020> lower<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
soon as it comes up to a boil lower the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.780 
soon as it comes up to a boil lower the
heat<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.009> bit<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:53.610> still

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
heat just a little bit but we will still

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.130 
heat just a little bit but we will still
want<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> keep<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> high<00:01:54.780> simmer

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
want to kind of keep it at a high simmer

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
want to kind of keep it at a high simmer
low<00:01:56.130> boil<00:01:56.430> simmer<00:01:57.180> means<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
low boil simmer means kind of just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.249 
low boil simmer means kind of just
bubbling<00:01:58.380> away<00:01:58.670> not<00:01:59.670> too<00:01:59.880> high<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.840> total

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
bubbling away not too high not a total

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.230 
bubbling away not too high not a total
full<00:02:01.469> boil<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.340> part<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:03.030> like

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
full boil but just like part maybe like

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.580 
full boil but just like part maybe like
three-quarters<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.990> pot<00:02:04.380> will<00:02:04.560> be

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
three-quarters of the pot will be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
three-quarters of the pot will be
bubbling<00:02:05.340> away<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.899> that's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
bubbling away and what that is that's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.300 
bubbling away and what that is that's
gonna<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.680> gonna<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> cook

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
gonna do is that's gonna kind of cook

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
gonna do is that's gonna kind of cook
off<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.459> milk<00:02:08.759> fast<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.179> they're<00:02:09.270> gonna<00:02:09.360> sell

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
off the milk fast and they're gonna sell

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
off the milk fast and they're gonna sell
it<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.800> gonna<00:02:10.860> sink<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it up and they're gonna sink to the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850 
it up and they're gonna sink to the
bottom<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> pan<00:02:12.170> about<00:02:13.170> 80

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
bottom of the pan about 80

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
bottom of the pan about 80
hopefully<00:02:14.160> 80%<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.850> will<00:02:15.120> sink<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
hopefully 80% of this will sink to the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.870 
hopefully 80% of this will sink to the
bottom<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> pan<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.710> other<00:02:16.830> 20%<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
bottom of the pan the other 20% which is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.300 
bottom of the pan the other 20% which is
gonna<00:02:18.060> kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.270> skim<00:02:18.480> off<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> ladle<00:02:19.310> and
