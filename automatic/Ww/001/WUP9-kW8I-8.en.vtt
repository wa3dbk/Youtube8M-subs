00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in the beginning this video that I'm

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
in the beginning this video that I'm

just trying to dye my hair without using
the<00:01:38.100> bleacher

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the bleacher

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
the bleacher
so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> tried<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> put<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> virgin<00:01:39.750> snow<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.960> my

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so I tried to put the virgin snow on my

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.569 
so I tried to put the virgin snow on my
black<00:01:40.290> hair<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> nothing<00:01:40.950> changed<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.400> that's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
black hair and nothing changed so that's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.800 
black hair and nothing changed so that's
why<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> didn't<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.540> neat

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
why I didn't really do it as neat

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330

the<00:01:44.430> black<00:01:44.610> part<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:44.939> hair<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> does

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
