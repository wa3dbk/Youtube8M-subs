00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
yet we can't really advance on to the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
yet we can't really advance on to the
next<00:01:18.750> level<00:01:19.110> until<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.530> practice<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.189> often

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
next level until they practice so often

the<00:01:20.850> lessons<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.509> fairly<00:01:22.020> repetitive<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.610> mean

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the lessons of fairly repetitive I mean

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
the lessons of fairly repetitive I mean
it's<00:01:24.420> my<00:01:24.570> job<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> teacher<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.470> try<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
it's my job as a teacher to try and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
it's my job as a teacher to try and
bring<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> some<00:01:26.939> new<00:01:26.970> things<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:28.009> there's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
bring in some new things but there's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
bring in some new things but there's
only<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.700> much<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.630> they're

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
only is so much you can do if they're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.429 
only is so much you can do if they're
not<00:01:30.960> practicing<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.689> students<00:01:34.259> like

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
not practicing so so for students like

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
not practicing so so for students like
that<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.400> probably<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.970> eighty

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that which is probably about eighty

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840 
that which is probably about eighty
percent<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.350> students<00:01:37.860> something<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> an

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
percent of my students something like an

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
percent of my students something like an
online<00:01:39.150> course<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.110> absolutely<00:01:40.710> perfect

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
online course is absolutely perfect

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.450 
online course is absolutely perfect
because<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.570> own<00:01:42.630> pace<00:01:43.460> it's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because you can go at your own pace it's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.270 
because you can go at your own pace it's
yeah<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.119> definitely<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
yeah it's definitely the way to go of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
yeah it's definitely the way to go of
the<00:01:47.430> future<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.270> those<00:01:48.450> kinds<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> students

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the future for those kinds of students

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.039 
the future for those kinds of students
