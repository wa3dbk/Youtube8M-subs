00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
on that but this ripped like completely

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.550 
on that but this ripped like completely
like<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.359> toes<00:01:05.600> are<00:01:05.810> gone<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.259> it's<00:01:06.409> almost

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
like the toes are gone so it's almost

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.039 
like the toes are gone so it's almost
like<00:01:06.770> you'd<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.789> skating<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.390> sandal<00:01:08.869> or

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
like you'd be skating in a sandal or

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.099 
like you'd be skating in a sandal or
something<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.939> like<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.060> design<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.689> thought<00:01:12.049> it

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
something I like the design I thought it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.959 
something I like the design I thought it
was<00:01:12.229> pretty<00:01:12.380> sick<00:01:12.710> purple<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.310> know<00:01:13.430> but<00:01:13.729> like

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
was pretty sick purple you know but like

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.139 
was pretty sick purple you know but like
I<00:01:14.240> think<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.840> came<00:01:15.020> with<00:01:15.170> black<00:01:15.409> shoe<00:01:16.189> laces<00:01:16.460> it

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
I think it came with black shoe laces it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.120 
I think it came with black shoe laces it
might<00:01:17.299> have<00:01:17.420> come<00:01:17.509> with<00:01:17.659> white<00:01:17.869> but<00:01:18.109> you<00:01:18.350> know

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
might have come with white but you know

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.410 
might have come with white but you know
I<00:01:19.159> don't<00:01:19.399> think<00:01:19.549> these<00:01:19.670> are<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.969> original

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
I don't think these are the original

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.870 
I don't think these are the original
that<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.890> came<00:01:22.100> with<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.310> cuz<00:01:22.609> like<00:01:22.759> you

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
that I that came with it cuz like you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.249 
that I that came with it cuz like you
know<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.030> had<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.210> replace<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.750> whatever<00:01:24.020> but

know I had to replace and whatever but

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.560 
know I had to replace and whatever but
this<00:01:24.829> wasn't<00:01:25.100> about<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.729> bottom<00:01:26.210> lasted

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.179 
this wasn't about you the bottom lasted
a<00:01:26.659> pretty<00:01:26.869> good<00:01:27.049> while<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.829> know<00:01:27.859> just
