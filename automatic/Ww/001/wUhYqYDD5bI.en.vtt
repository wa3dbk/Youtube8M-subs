the other hand the Wii U lacks any sort
of<00:00:36.230> presence<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:36.860> goes<00:00:37.100> almost<00:00:37.340> entirely

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
of presence and goes almost entirely

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.330 
of presence and goes almost entirely
incognito<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.380> that's<00:00:39.710> actually<00:00:39.950> kind<00:00:40.280> of

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
incognito and that's actually kind of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.520 
incognito and that's actually kind of
cool<00:00:40.520> okay<00:00:41.240> perhaps<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:41.900> could<00:00:42.020> have<00:00:42.170> used<00:00:42.200> a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
cool okay perhaps it could have used a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.740 
cool okay perhaps it could have used a
little<00:00:42.560> more<00:00:43.130> style<00:00:43.460> but<00:00:44.210> this<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
little more style but this is the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.080

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
feel of the Xbox one interface is clunky

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.380 
feel of the Xbox one interface is clunky
and<00:01:06.079> unintuitive<00:01:06.679> it<00:01:07.219> is<00:01:07.490> unfortunate<00:01:08.179> that<00:01:08.329> a

is that if you don't pin your games and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.840 
is that if you don't pin your games and
you<00:01:20.929> didn't<00:01:21.289> play<00:01:21.439> them<00:01:21.649> recently<00:01:22.219> you<00:01:22.609> have

you didn't play them recently you have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.910 
you didn't play them recently you have
to<00:01:22.999> go<00:01:23.149> into<00:01:23.359> your<00:01:23.479> games<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.109> apps<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.590> find
