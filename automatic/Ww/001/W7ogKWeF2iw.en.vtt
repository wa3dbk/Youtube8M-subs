armored let's look at this all this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.630 
armored let's look at this all this
right<00:02:41.350> here<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.650> 30<00:02:41.950> millimeters<00:02:42.460> that's

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
right here this is 30 millimeters that's

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.320 
right here this is 30 millimeters that's
the<00:02:42.790> thickest<00:02:43.270> armor<00:02:43.810> available<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:45.330> most

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the thickest armor available on it most

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.060 
the thickest armor available on it most
of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.570> rest<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.140> like<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:47.710> to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
of the rest of it is like up here to

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.240 
of the rest of it is like up here to
Coppola's<00:02:48.580> are<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.970> 25<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:50.050> back<00:02:50.860> here<00:02:51.100> to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.470 
Coppola's are just 25 and back here to
rare<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.820> only<00:02:52.480> eight<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.350> mean<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:54.240> just<00:02:55.240> think

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
rare is only eight I mean I just think

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.470 
rare is only eight I mean I just think
can<00:02:55.780> see<00:02:56.020> tier<00:02:56.650> 10<00:02:56.920> vehicles<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.240> doesn't

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
can see tier 10 vehicles so it doesn't

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.940 
can see tier 10 vehicles so it doesn't
even<00:02:58.540> really<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.930> enough<00:02:59.230> armor<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.650> resist

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
even really have enough armor to resist

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.990 
even really have enough armor to resist
high-explosive<00:03:00.100> shells<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.790> bit

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
high-explosive shells this this is a bit

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.930 
high-explosive shells this this is a bit
worrisome<00:03:04.570> already<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.460> does<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.670> get<00:03:06.820> in

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
worrisome already so what does it get in

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.840 
worrisome already so what does it get in
terms<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.360> gunman<00:03:08.250> well<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.520> gets<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.530> seer

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
terms of a gunman well it gets the seer

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.390 
terms of a gunman well it gets the seer
good<00:03:13.380> ok<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.530> wanting<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.860> come<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.220> from

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
good ok it's not wanting to come up from

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.740 
good ok it's not wanting to come up from
that<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.820> we'll<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:17.580> flips<00:03:18.580> he'll<00:03:19.270> just<00:03:19.540> have

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that so we'll just flips he'll just have

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.570 
that so we'll just flips he'll just have
to<00:03:20.940> get<00:03:21.940> up<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.270> way<00:03:22.450> here<00:03:23.320> we<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.470> as<00:03:23.680> two

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
to get up this way here we go as two

to get up this way here we go as two
hundred<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.910> three<00:03:25.120> millimeters<00:03:25.570> of

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
hundred and three millimeters of

hundred and three millimeters of
penetration<00:03:26.220> 240<00:03:27.220> damage<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:28.000> mean<00:03:28.630> look<00:03:28.960> at

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
penetration 240 damage I mean look at

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.340 
penetration 240 damage I mean look at
the<00:03:29.200> specs<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.800> looks<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.130> like<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.790> l71<00:03:31.540> 8.8

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
the specs it looks just like the l71 8.8

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.650 
the specs it looks just like the l71 8.8
centimeter<00:03:32.890> from<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:34.180> tiger<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.540> gets

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
centimeter from the tiger but it gets

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.220 
centimeter from the tiger but it gets
something<00:03:37.900> new<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.790> gets<00:03:40.150> heat<00:03:40.720> as<00:03:40.900> its

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
something new it gets heat as its

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.980 
something new it gets heat as its
premium<00:03:41.770> ammunition<00:03:42.400> instead<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.090> pcr<00:03:43.720> and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
premium ammunition instead of a pcr and

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.350 
premium ammunition instead of a pcr and
an<00:03:44.530> enjoys<00:03:44.830> 250<00:03:45.460> millimeters<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.910> penetration

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
an enjoys 250 millimeters of penetration

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.110 
an enjoys 250 millimeters of penetration
instead<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.020> what<00:03:47.440> if<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.590> tiger<00:03:47.800> one<00:03:48.310> with

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
instead of what if the tiger one with

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.710 
instead of what if the tiger one with
its<00:03:49.330> l71<00:03:50.320> get<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:51.280> gets<00:03:53.190> 237

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
its l71 get it gets 237

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.450 
its l71 get it gets 237
so<00:03:56.290> definitely<00:03:56.470> ammunition<00:03:57.070> type<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.370> a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
so definitely ammunition type of a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.950 
so definitely ammunition type of a
little<00:03:57.700> more<00:03:57.820> penetration<00:03:58.300> of<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> premium

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
little more penetration of the premium

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.110 
little more penetration of the premium
ammunition<00:03:59.830> but<00:03:59.980> other<00:04:00.130> than<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.370> it's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
ammunition but other than that it's

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.890 
ammunition but other than that it's
pretty<00:04:01.270> much<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.020> tiger<00:04:02.770> one's<00:04:03.010> l71<00:04:03.730> gun<00:04:05.400> okay

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
pretty much a tiger one's l71 gun okay

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.060 
pretty much a tiger one's l71 gun okay
accuracy<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:07.930> actually<00:04:08.470> somewhat<00:04:08.770> comparable

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
accuracy is actually somewhat comparable

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.720 
accuracy is actually somewhat comparable
point<00:04:09.580> 336<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:10.630> isn't<00:04:10.900> far<00:04:11.080> from<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.730> three

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
point 336 this isn't far from the three

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.310 
point 336 this isn't far from the three
four<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.210> were<00:04:13.300> used<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.600> out<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> tiger

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
four that were used to out of the tiger

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.539 
four that were used to out of the tiger
the<00:04:14.640> saving<00:04:15.640> time<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.970> only<00:04:16.060> 1.9<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:18.220> is

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
the saving time is only 1.9 to this is

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.220 
the saving time is only 1.9 to this is
actually<00:04:19.060> pretty<00:04:19.209> good<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.870> has<00:04:20.049> eight

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
actually pretty good it has eight

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.810 
actually pretty good it has eight
degrees<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> gun<00:04:20.769> depression<00:04:20.980> 15<00:04:21.549> degrees

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
degrees a gun depression 15 degrees

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.280 
degrees a gun depression 15 degrees
again<00:04:22.090> elevation<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.960> as<00:04:23.530> DPM<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.130> uh<00:04:25.290> well

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
again elevation and as DPM is uh well

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.770 
again elevation and as DPM is uh well
that's<00:04:26.470> okay<00:04:27.150> really<00:04:28.150> does<00:04:28.300> should<00:04:28.480> be<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
that's okay really does should be I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.720 
that's okay really does should be I
would<00:04:29.080> think<00:04:29.110> should<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.830> better<00:04:30.100> considering

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
would think should be better considering

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.730 
would think should be better considering
the<00:04:30.910> poor<00:04:31.180> armor<00:04:31.600> not<00:04:32.230> exactly<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> best

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
the poor armor not exactly the best

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.700 
the poor armor not exactly the best
penetration<00:04:33.610> or<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.940> best<00:04:34.950> dps<00:04:35.950> so<00:04:37.710> yeah

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
penetration or the best dps so yeah

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.410 
penetration or the best dps so yeah
really<00:04:39.100> would've<00:04:39.340> thought<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.580> would<00:04:39.820> hit<00:04:40.120> a

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
really would've thought that would hit a

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.420 
really would've thought that would hit a
little<00:04:41.380> high<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.800> number<00:04:41.980> let's<00:04:42.250> look<00:04:42.310> at

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
little high of a number let's look at

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.800 
little high of a number let's look at
the<00:04:42.520> taiga<00:04:42.790> one<00:04:42.940> again<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:43.420> real<00:04:43.570> quick

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the taiga one again here real quick

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.909 
the taiga one again here real quick
Aurelia<00:04:44.440> time<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.860> 6.4<00:04:45.580> seconds<00:04:46.770> ticking<00:04:47.770> on

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
Aurelia time is 6.4 seconds ticking on

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.530 
Aurelia time is 6.4 seconds ticking on
and<00:04:48.130> young<00:04:48.280> pram<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.760> hear<00:04:48.910> only<00:04:49.060> goes<00:04:49.360> up<00:04:49.390> to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
and young pram to hear only goes up to

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.680 
and young pram to hear only goes up to
6.0<00:04:50.110> for<00:04:50.230> one<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:53.850> hmm<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:57.480> really<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.600> be

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
6.0 for one so hmm is I really to be

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.970 
6.0 for one so hmm is I really to be
honest<00:04:58.930> about<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.320> not<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.680> looking

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
honest about it's not really looking

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.190 
honest about it's not really looking
like<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.280> greatest<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:01.120> tank<00:05:01.360> destroyers<00:05:01.960> at

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
like the greatest to tank destroyers at

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.710 
like the greatest to tank destroyers at
the<00:05:02.560> moment<00:05:03.900> now<00:05:04.900> gamma<00:05:05.770> factor<00:05:06.330> this<00:05:07.330> isn't

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
the moment now gamma factor this isn't

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.020 
the moment now gamma factor this isn't
really<00:05:07.960> known<00:05:08.410> I'm<00:05:09.220> guessing<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:09.790> it's

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
really known I'm guessing that it's

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.760 
really known I'm guessing that it's
going<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.330> be<00:05:10.540> high<00:05:10.840> now<00:05:11.140> this<00:05:11.290> thing<00:05:11.530> looks

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
going to be high now this thing looks

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.370 
going to be high now this thing looks
like<00:05:11.919> a<00:05:12.280> big<00:05:12.820> daddy<00:05:13.450> version<00:05:14.020> of<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.229> yag

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
like a big daddy version of the yag

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.120 
like a big daddy version of the yag
panzer<00:05:14.890> 4<00:05:14.919> it<00:05:15.729> just<00:05:15.880> has<00:05:16.030> yag<00:05:16.360> panzer<00:05:16.840> 4

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
panzer 4 it just has yag panzer 4

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.670 
panzer 4 it just has yag panzer 4
written<00:05:18.130> all<00:05:18.580> over<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:19.270> let's<00:05:20.080> see<00:05:20.260> where<00:05:20.470> is

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
written all over it let's see where is

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.420 
written all over it let's see where is
that<00:05:20.950> thing<00:05:21.010> by<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.490> way<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:23.169> up<00:05:23.290> here

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
that thing by the way it's up here

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.190 
that thing by the way it's up here
I<00:05:26.380> mean<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:27.620> just<00:05:27.950> look<00:05:28.250> at<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.840> just<00:05:29.840> look<00:05:30.050> at

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
I mean just just look at it just look at

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.820 
I mean just just look at it just look at
that<00:05:30.350> that's<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.760> then<00:05:31.970> we're<00:05:32.090> gonna<00:05:32.150> grab

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
that that's it and then we're gonna grab

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.240 
that that's it and then we're gonna grab
this<00:05:34.660> they<00:05:35.660> look<00:05:36.170> similar<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.860> they<00:05:36.950> look<00:05:37.100> to

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
this they look similar and they look to

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.730 
this they look similar and they look to
have<00:05:37.370> relatively<00:05:38.180> similar<00:05:38.570> guns<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.290> really

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
have relatively similar guns I really

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.080 
have relatively similar guns I really
think<00:05:39.950> that<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:40.250> is<00:05:40.310> going<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.850> want<00:05:41.000> it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
think that this is going to want it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.860 
think that this is going to want it
being<00:05:41.300> like<00:05:41.450> a<00:05:41.480> tier<00:05:41.870> 8<00:05:42.110> version<00:05:42.380> of<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:43.870> Yak

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
being like a tier 8 version of the Yak

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.590 
being like a tier 8 version of the Yak

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
panzer 4 i'm kind of surprised are

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.390 
panzer 4 i'm kind of surprised are
actually<00:05:47.930> wanting<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.350> add<00:05:48.530> this<00:05:48.830> tank<00:05:49.160> to<00:05:49.370> the

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
actually wanting to add this tank to the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.270 
actually wanting to add this tank to the
game<00:05:49.670> though<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.180> mean<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:51.560> was<00:05:51.680> just<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:51.980> rush

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
game though I mean it was just a rush

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.400 
game though I mean it was just a rush
together<00:05:52.670> of<00:05:52.910> a<00:05:53.000> bunch<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.360> old<00:05:53.540> you<00:05:53.990> otherwise

together of a bunch of old you otherwise

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.310 
together of a bunch of old you otherwise
useless<00:05:54.890> parts<00:05:55.810> vehicle<00:05:56.810> that's<00:05:56.990> all<00:05:57.140> this

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
useless parts vehicle that's all this

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.160 
useless parts vehicle that's all this
vehicle<00:05:57.740> really<00:05:57.980> was<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.640> it's<00:05:59.510> not<00:05:59.720> really

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
vehicle really was and it's not really

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.000 
vehicle really was and it's not really
the<00:06:00.200> best<00:06:00.500> in<00:06:00.980> armor<00:06:01.460> or<00:06:01.730> armament<00:06:03.010> there's

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
the best in armor or armament there's

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.220 
the best in armor or armament there's
nothing<00:06:04.340> particularly<00:06:04.670> special<00:06:04.850> about<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.960> I

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
nothing particularly special about it I

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
nothing particularly special about it I
really<00:06:06.590> have<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.770> say<00:06:06.950> it<00:06:07.100> has<00:06:07.220> a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
really have to say it has a

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.950 
really have to say it has a
500-horsepower<00:06:07.790> engine<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:08.690> gives<00:06:08.870> it

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
500-horsepower engine that gives it

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.850 
500-horsepower engine that gives it
almost<00:06:09.350> 20<00:06:09.800> horsepower<00:06:10.160> per<00:06:10.610> ton<00:06:11.680> that's<00:06:12.680> not

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
almost 20 horsepower per ton that's not

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.250 
almost 20 horsepower per ton that's not
that<00:06:12.980> bad<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:13.520> it<00:06:14.210> goes<00:06:14.360> 70<00:06:14.780> kilometers<00:06:15.230> an

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
that bad and it goes 70 kilometers an

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.510 
that bad and it goes 70 kilometers an
hour<00:06:15.440> for<00:06:15.860> 20<00:06:16.340> reverse<00:06:16.640> I<00:06:16.910> mean<00:06:17.120> I<00:06:18.520> really

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
hour for 20 reverse I mean I really

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.280 
hour for 20 reverse I mean I really
think<00:06:19.850> this<00:06:20.030> is<00:06:20.210> going<00:06:20.420> to<00:06:20.750> just<00:06:20.960> be<00:06:21.110> one<00:06:21.260> of

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
think this is going to just be one of

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.740 
think this is going to just be one of
those<00:06:21.410> fast<00:06:21.940> stealthy<00:06:22.940> tight<00:06:23.210> tank

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
those fast stealthy tight tank

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.390 
those fast stealthy tight tank
destroyers<00:06:24.290> because<00:06:24.500> it's<00:06:24.650> just<00:06:24.710> got<00:06:25.310> it

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
destroyers because it's just got it

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.870 
destroyers because it's just got it
written<00:06:25.670> all<00:06:26.030> over<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:27.400> it'll<00:06:28.400> be<00:06:28.490> good<00:06:28.610> will

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
written all over it it'll be good will

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.850 
written all over it it'll be good will
be<00:06:29.030> bad<00:06:29.210> I<00:06:29.480> can't<00:06:29.750> tell<00:06:29.930> that<00:06:30.080> quite<00:06:30.350> yet<00:06:30.380> I

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
be bad I can't tell that quite yet I

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.770 
be bad I can't tell that quite yet I
have<00:06:31.340> a<00:06:31.430> feeling<00:06:31.730> this<00:06:31.820> might<00:06:32.000> actually<00:06:32.270> be<00:06:32.510> a

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
have a feeling this might actually be a

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.660 
have a feeling this might actually be a
pretty<00:06:32.810> good<00:06:33.350> tank<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.770> mean<00:06:34.070> it<00:06:34.280> hugs<00:06:34.550> the

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
pretty good tank I mean it hugs the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.010 
pretty good tank I mean it hugs the
ground<00:06:34.760> so<00:06:35.150> obviously<00:06:35.390> I<00:06:35.450> have<00:06:35.600> a<00:06:35.660> good<00:06:35.810> cam

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
ground so obviously I have a good cam

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.280 
ground so obviously I have a good cam
factor<00:06:36.470> that's<00:06:36.920> insanely<00:06:37.430> fast<00:06:37.910> so<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:39.080> can

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
factor that's insanely fast so I can
