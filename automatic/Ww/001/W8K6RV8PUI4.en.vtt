00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that's the soda trap that takes those

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.000 
that's the soda trap that takes those
things<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.260> removed<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.740> sprayed

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
off in another location and basically

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
off in another location and basically
that's<00:00:21.539> also<00:00:21.900> removed<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> clean

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's also removed so they can clean

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.240 
that's also removed so they can clean
these<00:00:23.789> surfaces<00:00:24.420> right<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.619> pop

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
these surfaces right here the pop

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
these surfaces right here the pop
nozzles<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.849> been<00:00:30.029> removed<00:00:30.390> already<00:00:31.170> prior

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
nozzles have been removed already prior

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.760 
nozzles have been removed already prior
there<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.270> degreaser<00:00:33.780> soaking<00:00:36.770> heave

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
there in the degreaser soaking heave

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.310 
there in the degreaser soaking heave
through<00:00:38.219> every<00:00:38.879> single<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.489> usually

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
through every single one in here usually

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
through every single one in here usually
that's<00:00:43.320> done<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.800> save<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that's done to save time the way you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.770 
that's done to save time the way you
take<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.850> turn<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:50.969> clockwise<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
take them off is turn them clockwise and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
take them off is turn them clockwise and
then<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> pull<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.590> off<00:00:52.710> some<00:00:53.100> people

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
then you can pull them off some people

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.350 
then you can pull them off some people

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
as you can see the circle here there's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
as you can see the circle here there's
two<00:01:17.729> pieces<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> nozzle<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> got<00:01:19.799> pop

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
two pieces to a nozzle and you got pop
