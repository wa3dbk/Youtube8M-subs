00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
performance from him and then you've
also<00:01:22.500> got<00:01:22.650> Memphis<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> pay<00:01:23.400> he<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.670> started

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
also got Memphis to pay he was started

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
also got Memphis to pay he was started
in<00:01:24.060> behind<00:01:24.390> Rooney<00:01:24.750> who<00:01:25.110> had<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> quiet<00:01:25.799> game<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
in behind Rooney who had a quiet game to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
in behind Rooney who had a quiet game to
be<00:01:26.340> fair<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> him<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.939> did<00:01:27.210> Wayne<00:01:27.360> Rooney<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
be fair to him as did Wayne Rooney to be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
be fair to him as did Wayne Rooney to be
honest<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.170> Memphis<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.920> pay<00:01:29.100> maybe<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.970> its

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
honest but Memphis to pay maybe not its

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.640 
honest but Memphis to pay maybe not its
natural<00:01:30.360> position<00:01:30.450> there<00:01:30.840> perhaps<00:01:31.110> feels<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
natural position there perhaps feels a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.940 
natural position there perhaps feels a
little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.880> comfortable<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.390> wide

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
little bit more comfortable out wide

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.080 
little bit more comfortable out wide
certainly<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> quiet<00:01:35.579> performance

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
certainly it was a quiet performance

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.310

positive<00:03:51.690> display<00:03:52.349> positive<00:03:52.829> performance

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980
