00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.440 
me is just a really sensitive pose and
this<00:00:09.510> model<00:00:10.290> has<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> real<00:00:10.740> insight<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.849> I

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
this model has a real insight and I

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.850 
this model has a real insight and I
think<00:00:12.660> he's<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:12.960> sensitive<00:00:13.200> okay<00:00:13.650> we're

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
think he's very sensitive okay we're

a<00:00:30.330> look<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> arm<00:00:31.640> here's<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> top<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a look at the arm here's the top of the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.160 
a look at the arm here's the top of the
deltoid<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.399> coming<00:00:35.399> down

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
deltoid here coming down

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.540 
deltoid here coming down
okay<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> deltoid<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:38.100> connects<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
okay the deltoid actually connects to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
okay the deltoid actually connects to
the<00:00:38.700> back<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> sternum<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the back of the sternum and to the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
the back of the sternum and to the
clavicle<00:00:41.250> notice<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.329> rhythms

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
in under the coracoid process way back

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
in under the coracoid process way back
there<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> other<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.730> goes<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:01.050> split<00:01:01.410> off

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
there the other one goes will split off

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.720 
there the other one goes will split off
and<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.949> what's<00:01:02.129> called<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and the what's called the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.250 
and the what's called the
coracobrachialis<00:01:04.100> right<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:06.260> bicep

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
coracobrachialis right over here bicep

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
coracobrachialis right over here bicep
brachii<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.220> supinator

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
brachii is a supinator

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.429 
brachii is a supinator
will<00:01:09.540> allow<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.680> direction<00:01:11.130> and

will allow you to go this direction and
so<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.340> connect<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.259> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so one of them will connect to the to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.340 
so one of them will connect to the to
the<00:01:16.520> radius<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:18.060> thumb<00:01:18.299> side<00:01:18.630> and

the radius which is your thumb side and
the<00:01:19.560> other<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> connects<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> what's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the other one connects this to what's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.999 
the other one connects this to what's
called<00:01:20.759> fashio<00:01:21.090> okay<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:22.770> we're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
called fashio okay there we go we're

lower arm in a second look at the leg

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
lower arm in a second look at the leg
here<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.799> cool<00:01:47.100> piece<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
here this is a really cool piece of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.240 
here this is a really cool piece of
tracing<00:01:48.329> paper<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:50.460> online<00:01:51.060> teaching<00:01:52.250> okay

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so over here we have the box shape

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.730 
so over here we have the box shape
fitting<00:01:55.909> for<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> leg<00:01:57.540> since<00:01:58.049> fitting<00:01:58.439> into

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
fitting for the leg since fitting into

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
fitting for the leg since fitting into
the<00:01:58.920> box<00:01:59.310> shape<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> pelvis<00:02:00.920> gluteus

this<00:02:04.350> way<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> gluteus<00:02:05.070> medius<00:02:05.280> actually

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
this way the gluteus medius actually

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
this way the gluteus medius actually
comes<00:02:06.180> down<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.110> connects<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> great

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
comes down and connects to the great
