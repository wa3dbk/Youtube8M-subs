00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.150
 the cpu 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.810
 once the processor is placed in its 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.080
 Socket we can arrange to place the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.080
 heatsink 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.200

 feeding 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.800
 and the hard drive

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.900
 making sure that it fits completely 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.900
