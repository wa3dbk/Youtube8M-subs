00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this game if you shoot a portal the one

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.000 
this game if you shoot a portal the one
that<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> were<00:00:46.320> standing<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.920> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that you were standing and it like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
that you were standing and it like
launches<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
launches you out a little bit but you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
launches you out a little bit but you
could<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> floors<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.219> patch

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
could do it on the floors but they patch

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
could do it on the floors but they patch
that<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> did<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.809> shoot<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that so I did is if I shoot the one that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
that so I did is if I shoot the one that
was<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> floor<00:00:52.949> against<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> wall<00:00:53.610> the

was on the floor against the wall the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
was on the floor against the wall the
same<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:54.510> happens<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> lot

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
