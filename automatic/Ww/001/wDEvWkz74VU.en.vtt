00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
the other make sure that they're the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.660 
the other make sure that they're the
same<00:01:49.630> shape<00:01:49.690> if<00:01:50.679> you<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:50.950> finish<00:01:51.399> one<00:01:51.640> eye

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
same shape if you just finish one eye

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.940 
same shape if you just finish one eye
completely<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.869> then<00:01:53.410> move<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.710> other<00:01:53.740> eye

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
completely and then move the other eye

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.609 
completely and then move the other eye
you<00:01:54.399> really<00:01:54.940> have<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> tough<00:01:55.660> time<00:01:55.929> matching<00:01:56.259> it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
you really have a tough time matching it

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.560 
you really have a tough time matching it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
so it's better to do them both at the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.219 
so it's better to do them both at the
same<00:01:58.690> time<00:01:58.929> progress<00:01:59.380> at<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.770> same<00:01:59.979> time<00:02:00.280> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
