00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
about the little ink holder that I make

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
about the little ink holder that I make
with<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> pin<00:00:10.370> it's<00:00:11.370> very<00:00:11.759> simple<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.389> lot<00:00:13.230> of

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
with the pin it's very simple a lot of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.010 
with the pin it's very simple a lot of
you<00:00:13.440> guys<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.740> probably<00:00:14.210> putting<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.719> into

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
you guys are probably putting it into

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.439 
you guys are probably putting it into
the<00:00:16.260> flame<00:00:16.500> too<00:00:17.190> much<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.820> melting<00:00:18.270> too

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the flame too much and it's melting too

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960 
the flame too much and it's melting too
fast<00:00:18.720> okay<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.500> guess<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> need<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
fast okay I guess that you need to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.210 
fast okay I guess that you need to
rotate<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:21.779> slowly<00:00:22.140> very<00:00:22.500> patiently<00:00:23.359> so

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
rotate it very slowly very patiently so

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
rotate it very slowly very patiently so

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
is about that much off from the flame

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.540 
is about that much off from the flame
keep<00:03:48.400> rotating<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:49.090> very<00:03:49.600> evenly<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:51.490> it

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
keep rotating it very evenly and it

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.010 
keep rotating it very evenly and it
comes<00:03:51.760> off<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> little<00:03:52.360> tube<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:55.020> now

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
comes off to a little tube like that now

comes off to a little tube like that now
what<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.350> need<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> do<00:03:56.770> is<00:03:58.020> cut<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.140> one

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
what you need to do is cut this one

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.380 
what you need to do is cut this one
right<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.650> center<00:04:00.600> okay<00:04:01.860> use<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.070> in

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
right in the center okay use this in

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.090 
right in the center okay use this in
here

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
here

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.970 
here
and<00:04:06.730> what<00:04:06.940> you're<00:04:07.060> going<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.270> do<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.750> make<00:04:08.740> this

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
and what you're going to do is make this

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.560 
and what you're going to do is make this
fit<00:04:09.460> into<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:10.060> tubing<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.830> right<00:04:12.480> there's<00:04:13.480> a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
fit into that tubing all right there's a

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.080 
fit into that tubing all right there's a
lot<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.780> ways<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.050> can<00:04:14.290> do<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.730> put<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.820> over<00:04:15.910> a

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
lot of ways you can do it put it over a

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.800 
lot of ways you can do it put it over a
flame<00:04:16.390> again<00:04:18.270> after<00:04:19.270> you<00:04:19.360> put<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.570> over<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
flame again after you put it over the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.650 
flame again after you put it over the
flame<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:21.010> lightly<00:04:21.310> press<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:21.880> down<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
flame just lightly press it down and it

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.770 
flame just lightly press it down and it
goes<00:04:22.840> very<00:04:23.170> it's<00:04:23.880> gets<00:04:24.880> smaller<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.720> smaller

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
goes very it's gets smaller and smaller

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.420 
goes very it's gets smaller and smaller
and<00:04:26.290> smaller<00:04:26.530> okay<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:29.530> that's<00:04:29.800> how<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.130> make

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
and smaller okay so that's how you make

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.110 
and smaller okay so that's how you make
a<00:04:30.730> little<00:04:31.360> too
