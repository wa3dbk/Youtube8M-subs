00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.540
 Y 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.410
 this piece of pottery is the closest thing 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.200
 to a human face we are going to mark with 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.480
 white paint all the bottom of the eye 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.060
 and later that I already know that the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.610
 paint we are going to use in this case 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.779
 coffee color to make the girl of the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.140
 eyes we mark our centers 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.509
 we extend the painting in a circular 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.190
 until leaving the lateral surfaces 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.170
 of the white eye that are small 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.930
 remember that we have to extend the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 eye girl as much as you can 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 and round up trying to make them look 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.890
 similar always that's the secret of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.890
 make eyes look even 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.490
 once the paint dries we mark the 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.240
 Likewise with striped dots 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.940
 from the center and extend the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.940
 sideways paint in round shape 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.000
 without reaching the lower part of the eye 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.870
 we delineate the contour of coffee 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.760
 with the tip of the brush to make it the 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.760
 line as thin as possible 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.500
 let's delineate the top part of the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
 eye 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.710
 with tip we slide the brush 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.060
 we swell the line above and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.869
 we ended up on tip 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.240
 in this case we are retouching 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.080
 continually 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.530
 because it is necessary that the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.530
 eye when we do it on the sheet as not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.410
 we have not set a limit for 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.560
 matter but here the important thing is that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.069
 we are similar no matter how many 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.799
 Sometimes we have to pass the brush 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.920
 the top line should have more 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.920
 thickness than the beginning and the end 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.110
 we match 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.280
 if it is thicker on one side then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.280
 we swell the other 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 Y 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.569
 the lower part of the eye in the same way 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.660
 We are going to use the same technique 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.750
 tip we go down point but it must be the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.560
 line much thinner than the part of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.180
 above and the tabs again of the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 center out 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.140
 raising a bit the brush so that 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.650
 give us a tip at the end of the tab 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.500
 as abundant as everyone wants 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.780
 in this case I turn the piece because 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.959
 there will be people who accommodate us 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.720
 this way and there will be others that without 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.500
 need to move the piece so they can 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.500
 do 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.020
 we fill gaps 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.390
 so they look similar 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.830
 the tabs below are smaller and 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.830
 spaced 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.850
 remember that we must follow the line 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.600
 as if we were marking the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.600
 again 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.740
 the eyebrows 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:55.270
 likewise tip we lower the brush and 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.270
 we do it in a curve 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.919
 and we end up in stock 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.490
 we make the corrections that are 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.490
 necessary to thicken or lose weight 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.410
 and the light in this case as we assume a 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.930
 human eye let's do simulating with 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.970
 some small stripes with the tip of the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.970
 Brush the shine 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.520
 the correct way again we mark 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.129
 our lines below the eye 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.090
 and we will continue our line as 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:38.430
 if we were drawing the new mind 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.360
 but taking out the brush in a half circle 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.740
 with small strokes out of the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.740
 center out
