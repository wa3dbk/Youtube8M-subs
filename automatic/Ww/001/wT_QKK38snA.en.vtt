only supposed to be finger tight now for
my<00:00:56.699> application<00:00:56.879> since<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> already<00:00:57.839> have<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
my application since we already have to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
my application since we already have to
triple<00:00:58.829> filters<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.819> truck<00:01:00.149> mount<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
triple filters in the truck mount we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.259 
triple filters in the truck mount we
don't<00:01:01.139> need<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> extra<00:01:01.620> assembly<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.059> my

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
don't need this extra assembly so in my

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.479 
don't need this extra assembly so in my
particular<00:01:03.620> installation<00:01:04.620> we<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.250> went

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
particular installation we just went

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
particular installation we just went
from<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.210> eighth<00:01:06.360> inch<00:01:06.630> npt<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
from the eighth inch npt which is the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
from the eighth inch npt which is the
output<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.190> high-pressure<00:01:08.880> solution

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
output of the high-pressure solution

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.700 
output of the high-pressure solution
line<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> quarter<00:01:10.890> inch<00:01:11.270> NPT<00:01:12.270> adapter<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
line to a quarter inch NPT adapter to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.790 
line to a quarter inch NPT adapter to
the<00:01:13.920> carpet<00:01:14.730> cleaning<00:01:14.990> assembly<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
the carpet cleaning assembly and you can

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.890 
the carpet cleaning assembly and you can
see<00:01:16.980> we<00:01:17.190> eliminated<00:01:18.120> quite<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.690> mess

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
see we eliminated quite a bit of mess

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380 
see we eliminated quite a bit of mess
here<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:20.670> ain't<00:01:20.910> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> work<00:01:21.150> for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
here and this ain't going to work for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
here and this ain't going to work for
everybody<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.260> particular

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
everybody but for my particular

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
everybody but for my particular
installation<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> work<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
installation it's going to work like a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
installation it's going to work like a
charm<00:01:24.690> all<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.800> one<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:26.340> things<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
charm all right one of the next things I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.210 
charm all right one of the next things I
want<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.120> actually<00:01:27.420> test<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.890> spray

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
want to do is actually test the spray

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
want to do is actually test the spray
bar<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:30.180> reason<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.660> do<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bar and the reason I want to do this is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.130 
bar and the reason I want to do this is
because<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.650> only<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.300> one<00:01:33.300> input<00:01:33.870> into

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
because it only has one one input into

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
because it only has one one input into
the<00:01:34.260> spray<00:01:34.530> bar<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.190> my<00:01:35.520> thought<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the spray bar so my thought would be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.530 
the spray bar so my thought would be
that<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.770> strongest<00:01:38.390> where<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that it would be the strongest where it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
that it would be the strongest where it
actually<00:01:39.690> comes<00:01:40.050> out<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.860> would

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
actually comes out and then you would

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.250 
actually comes out and then you would
have<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.250> weakest<00:01:41.640> spray<00:01:41.940> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.840> edges

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
have the weakest spray on the edges

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.200 
have the weakest spray on the edges
whatever's<00:01:43.650> farthest<00:01:44.130> away<00:01:44.310> from<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
whatever's farthest away from where it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
whatever's farthest away from where it
goes<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.410> test<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> without<00:01:47.280> getting

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
goes in so to test this without getting

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.530 
goes in so to test this without getting
soaking<00:01:47.880> wet<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.350> air<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> simple

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
soaking wet we use air we have a simple

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
soaking wet we use air we have a simple
hose<00:01:51.660> that<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> made<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.530> shop<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
hose that we made here in the shop it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
hose that we made here in the shop it
flows<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:53.730> my<00:01:53.790> air<00:01:54.000> compressor<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
flows into my air compressor and then it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
flows into my air compressor and then it
has<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.290> carpet<00:01:55.680> cleaning<00:01:55.860> uh<00:01:56.010> coupler<00:01:56.970> on<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
has a carpet cleaning uh coupler on the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.070 
has a carpet cleaning uh coupler on the
end<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.560> blow<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:58.950> any<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.520> my<00:02:00.080> wands

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
end so I can blow out any of my wands

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.990 
end so I can blow out any of my wands
and<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.860> everything<00:02:02.220> else<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> check

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and you know everything else and check

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.550 
and you know everything else and check
and<00:02:03.150> see<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.480> have<00:02:03.600> any<00:02:03.750> clogged<00:02:03.930> jets<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and see if we have any clogged jets and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.420 
and see if we have any clogged jets and
all<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.980> good<00:02:05.130> stuff<00:02:05.160> without

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
all that kind of good stuff without

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
all that kind of good stuff without
getting<00:02:05.550> soaking<00:02:06.030> wet<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.930> real<00:02:07.200> great

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
getting soaking wet this is a real great

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109 
getting soaking wet this is a real great
thing<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.800> make<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.369> inside<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.879> shop

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
thing to make and have inside your shop

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
thing to make and have inside your shop
so<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.629> gonna<00:02:09.780> plug<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.379> let's<00:02:10.530> get

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
so I'm gonna plug that in and let's get

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I'm gonna plug that in and let's get
going<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.760> right<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:12.030> got

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
going on that all right we got

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.839 
going on that all right we got
everything<00:02:12.420> hooked<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.580> now<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.640> can

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
everything hooked up so now we can

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.710 
everything hooked up so now we can
actually<00:02:14.970> take<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> tool<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:16.110> turn<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> on

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.090 

okay<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.990> valve<00:02:23.170> does<00:02:23.440> turn<00:02:23.680> all<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.070> way

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
okay so the valve does turn all the way

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.630 
okay so the valve does turn all the way
to<00:02:24.250> completely<00:02:24.700> shut<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.120> off<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.520> don't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
to completely shut it off then I don't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.860 
to completely shut it off then I don't
know<00:02:27.730> if<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.880> can<00:02:28.000> hear<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> camera

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
know if you can hear that to the camera

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.080 
know if you can hear that to the camera
but<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.860> actually<00:02:36.190> feels<00:02:36.430> pretty<00:02:36.490> good<00:02:36.850> across

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
but it actually feels pretty good across

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150 
but it actually feels pretty good across
the<00:02:37.210> whole<00:02:37.600> length<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.860> feels<00:02:39.040> like

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
the whole length of it it feels like

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.480 
the whole length of it it feels like
there's<00:02:39.340> about<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.700> same<00:02:39.940> airflow<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
there's about the same airflow on the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.340 
there's about the same airflow on the
sides<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:43.000> serious<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> middle<00:02:43.780> which

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
sides as serious in the middle which

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.900 
sides as serious in the middle which
that<00:02:44.650> actually<00:02:44.950> surprised<00:02:45.340> me<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
that actually surprised me so that's a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.670 
that actually surprised me so that's a
great<00:02:46.150> thing<00:02:46.210> about<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.750> design<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
great thing about this design is that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.910 
great thing about this design is that
you<00:02:47.860> do<00:02:48.010> have<00:02:48.190> even<00:02:49.020> consistent<00:02:50.020> clean<00:02:50.350> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you do have even consistent clean and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 
you do have even consistent clean and
you<00:02:51.070> don't<00:02:51.160> soak<00:02:51.580> anything<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> middle

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you don't soak anything in the middle

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.370 
you don't soak anything in the middle
and<00:02:52.630> then<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> sides<00:02:53.050> are<00:02:53.230> dry

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and then the sides are dry

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.420 
and then the sides are dry
leave<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> opening<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.100> up<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.400> a

see how you can definitely feel it so

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.140 
see how you can definitely feel it so
just<00:03:11.069> have<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> forward<00:03:11.760> angle<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:17.150> so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
just have a forward angle to it to so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.210 
just have a forward angle to it to so
our<00:03:18.390> next<00:03:18.569> thing<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.930> let's<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.500> inside<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.159> a

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
our next thing is let's get inside of a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890 
our next thing is let's get inside of a
national<00:03:20.549> clients<00:03:20.730> house<00:03:21.060> let's<00:03:21.540> try<00:03:21.840> to

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
see if it comes through because when it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.890 
see if it comes through because when it
goes<00:03:26.069> back<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> boardroom<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.150> may<00:03:27.720> get

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
goes back to the boardroom it may get

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.420 
goes back to the boardroom it may get
fired<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.530> if<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.799> gets<00:03:28.859> fired<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.310> gets

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
fired and if it gets fired it gets

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.679 
fired and if it gets fired it gets
