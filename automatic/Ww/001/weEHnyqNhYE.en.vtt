sensitivity<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.079> what<00:03:33.889> I<00:03:33.919> have<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.160> say

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
sensitivity up and what I have to say

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.559 
sensitivity up and what I have to say
about<00:03:34.400> sensitivity<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.120> know<00:03:35.239> some

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
about sensitivity I know some

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.500 
about sensitivity I know some
commentators<00:03:35.959> may<00:03:36.260> say<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> know<00:03:37.419> you<00:03:38.419> know

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
commentators may say you know you know

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.479 
commentators may say you know you know
hi<00:03:38.690> says<00:03:38.930> high<00:03:39.470> sensitivity<00:03:40.010> isn't

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
hi says high sensitivity isn't

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.099 
hi says high sensitivity isn't
necessarily<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.150> key

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
necessarily the key

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.140 
necessarily the key
well<00:03:42.440> my<00:03:42.590> sensitivity<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.220> at<00:03:43.340> eight<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.730> I

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
well my sensitivity is at eight and I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.789 
well my sensitivity is at eight and I
know<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:44.750> do<00:03:44.840> every<00:03:45.290> single<00:03:45.440> thing

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
know that I can do every single thing

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.559 
know that I can do every single thing
that<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:46.069> person<00:03:46.430> with<00:03:46.669> low<00:03:46.819> sensitivity<00:03:47.090> can

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
that a person with low sensitivity can

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.360 
that a person with low sensitivity can
do<00:03:47.720> but<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> know<00:03:48.379> that<00:03:48.560> they<00:03:48.739> can't<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.099> all<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
do but I know that they can't do all the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.770 
do but I know that they can't do all the
things<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:49.639> I<00:03:49.760> can<00:03:49.970> do<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.299> that's<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.629> way

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
things that I can do and that's the way

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.990 
things that I can do and that's the way
that<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.019> like<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.319> think<00:03:51.590> about<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.760> if

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
that I like to think about it because if

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.210 
that I like to think about it because if
you<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.269> get<00:03:53.480> acclimated<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.980> higher

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
you can get acclimated to a higher

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.860 
you can get acclimated to a higher
sensitivity<00:03:55.579> if<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.150> can<00:03:56.269> get<00:03:56.389> used<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.750> it

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
sensitivity if you can get used to it

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.860 
sensitivity if you can get used to it
that<00:03:57.049> means<00:03:57.590> that<00:03:58.010> over<00:03:58.459> time<00:03:58.639> if<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.389> use<00:03:59.720> it

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
that means that over time if you use it

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.559 
that means that over time if you use it
enough<00:04:00.139> you<00:04:00.500> will<00:04:00.739> be<00:04:00.799> able<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.430> control<00:04:02.329> it

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
enough you will be able to control it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.420 
enough you will be able to control it
and<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:03.079> won't<00:04:03.290> feel<00:04:03.470> fast<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.069> it'll<00:04:04.310> feel

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
and it won't feel fast to you it'll feel

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.150 
and it won't feel fast to you it'll feel
normal<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.879> you<00:04:04.970> but<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.359> can<00:04:05.510> also<00:04:06.129> you<00:04:07.129> know

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
normal to you but you can also you know

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.729 
normal to you but you can also you know
you<00:04:07.340> can<00:04:07.609> do<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> 720<00:04:08.690> off<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.930> building<00:04:09.290> or<00:04:09.470> you

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
you can do a 720 off a building or you

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.319 
you can do a 720 off a building or you
know<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:09.919> can<00:04:10.069> turn<00:04:10.250> on<00:04:10.400> somebody<00:04:10.790> who's

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
know you can turn on somebody who's

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.119 
know you can turn on somebody who's
shooting<00:04:11.629> on<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.930> which<00:04:12.470> actually<00:04:12.829> did<00:04:12.949> quite

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
shooting on you which actually did quite

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.390 
shooting on you which actually did quite
a<00:04:13.190> few<00:04:13.370> times<00:04:13.579> in<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.879> game<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:15.829> you<00:04:16.250> know<00:04:16.370> I

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
a few times in this game so you know I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.370 
a few times in this game so you know I
recommend<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.150> move<00:04:17.660> your<00:04:17.810> sensitivity<00:04:18.289> up

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
recommend you move your sensitivity up

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.930 
recommend you move your sensitivity up
slowly<00:04:18.680> don't<00:04:19.070> try<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.400> jump<00:04:19.639> too<00:04:19.910> high

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
slowly don't try and jump too high

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.020 
slowly don't try and jump too high
sensitivity<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:21.440> I'll<00:04:22.250> say<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.610> again<00:04:22.699> my

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
sensitivity but I'll say it again my

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.719 
sensitivity but I'll say it again my
sensitivity<00:04:23.449> is<00:04:23.630> 8<00:04:23.810> right<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:24.979> at<00:04:25.130> 8:24

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
sensitivity is 8 right here at 8:24

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.390 
sensitivity is 8 right here at 8:24
coast<00:04:26.000> rig<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.210> got<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:26.690> worried<00:04:27.400> somebody

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
coast rig I got really worried somebody

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.820 
coast rig I got really worried somebody
backed<00:04:28.580> out<00:04:28.760> of<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.940> game<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.389> I<00:04:30.169> was<00:04:30.620> about

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
backed out of the game and I was about

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.860 
backed out of the game and I was about
the<00:04:30.979> flip<00:04:31.190> shit<00:04:31.430> if<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:32.210> would<00:04:32.419> have<00:04:32.539> ended

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
the flip shit if that would have ended

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.620 
the flip shit if that would have ended
but<00:04:33.500> luckily<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:34.250> host<00:04:34.669> migration<00:04:34.880> didn't<00:04:35.479> fail

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
but luckily a host migration didn't fail

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.080 
but luckily a host migration didn't fail
this

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
this

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.740

whoo finally and I've still got to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.000 
whoo finally and I've still got to
patrol<00:04:40.050> these<00:04:40.200> three<00:04:40.380> areas<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:40.890> we're

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
patrol these three areas when we're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.140 
patrol these three areas when we're
getting<00:04:41.160> kind<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.340> worried<00:04:41.670> because<00:04:41.700> somebody

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
getting kind of worried because somebody

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
just called in a care package luckily I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.070 
just called in a care package luckily I
get<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> nuke<00:04:44.790> but<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.240> decided<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.810> wasn't

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
get the nuke but I decided that wasn't

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.840 
get the nuke but I decided that wasn't
good<00:04:46.350> enough<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.800> was<00:04:46.950> going<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.130> continue<00:04:47.370> on

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
good enough I was going to continue on

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.220 
good enough I was going to continue on
this<00:04:48.450> rampage<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.410> risk<00:04:49.680> dying<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:51.020> take<00:04:52.020> off<00:04:52.140> a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
this rampage and risk dying I take off a

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.290 
this rampage and risk dying I take off a
guy<00:04:52.380> who's<00:04:52.620> rushed<00:04:52.800> me<00:04:52.950> at<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.130> stairs<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.760> if

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
guy who's rushed me at the stairs and if

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.370 
guy who's rushed me at the stairs and if
I<00:04:54.420> didn't<00:04:54.720> say<00:04:54.960> already<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.620> ump-45<00:04:56.460> um<00:04:57.380> some

I didn't say already this ump-45 um some

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.050 
I didn't say already this ump-45 um some
people<00:04:58.410> might<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.160> use<00:04:59.370> cold-blooded<00:04:59.970> on

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
people might like to use cold-blooded on

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.340 
people might like to use cold-blooded on
it<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.360> recommend<00:05:00.900> if<00:05:01.050> you're<00:05:01.170> going<00:05:01.260> to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
it but I recommend if you're going to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.930 
it but I recommend if you're going to
use<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> silencer<00:05:01.710> which<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.370> my<00:05:02.520> opinion<00:05:02.580> is

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
use a silencer which in my opinion is

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.420 
use a silencer which in my opinion is
the<00:05:03.060> best<00:05:03.120> attachment<00:05:03.750> for<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:05.010> want<00:05:05.340> to

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
the best attachment for it you want to

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.270 
the best attachment for it you want to
use<00:05:05.460> stopping<00:05:06.120> power<00:05:06.440> not<00:05:07.440> cold-blooded<00:05:07.770> not

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
use stopping power not cold-blooded not

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.890 
use stopping power not cold-blooded not
hardline<00:05:08.730> nothing<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.360> because<00:05:09.780> this
