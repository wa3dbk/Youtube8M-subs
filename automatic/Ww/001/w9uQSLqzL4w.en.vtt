fit<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.860> first<00:00:47.129> open

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
fit it in there so I mean you first open

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.069 
fit it in there so I mean you first open
it<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.570> thing<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> know

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it it's just the first thing you know

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.279 
it it's just the first thing you know
the<00:00:49.170> main<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.710> power<00:00:49.950> outlet<00:00:51.289> normally

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the main thing is power outlet normally

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
the main thing is power outlet normally
it's<00:00:53.129> pretty<00:00:53.399> small<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.989> then<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.170> just

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it's pretty small and so then you just

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.189 
it's pretty small and so then you just
open<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.480> no<00:01:00.480> usually<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:00.989> happen

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
open this up no usually doesn't happen

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.750 
open this up no usually doesn't happen
and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> usually<00:01:01.980> comes<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> piece<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and it usually comes with a piece of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
and it usually comes with a piece of
plastic<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.680> but<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.949> see

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
plastic right here but as you can see

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.590 
plastic right here but as you can see
you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.990> really<00:01:06.990> small<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:09.450> like

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
you know it's really small and it's like

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.789 
you know it's really small and it's like
the<00:01:10.320> palm<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.710> my<00:01:10.740> hand

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
the palm of my hand

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.730 
the palm of my hand
you<00:01:12.950> know<00:01:13.329> there's<00:01:14.329> no<00:01:14.450> buttons<00:01:14.869> on<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.200> either

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
you know there's no buttons on it either

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.730 
you know there's no buttons on it either
so<00:01:16.429> I<00:01:16.460> mean<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:17.450> just<00:01:18.020> turns<00:01:18.259> on<00:01:18.439> you're<00:01:18.679> not

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so I mean it just turns on you're not

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.510 
so I mean it just turns on you're not
the<00:01:18.920> worry<00:01:19.039> about<00:01:19.280> turning<00:01:19.609> it<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:20.000> wrong

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
the worry about turning it on the wrong

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.709 
the worry about turning it on the wrong
so<00:01:22.520> these<00:01:22.729> are<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.939> connections<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.509> really

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
so these are the connections I really

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.289 
so these are the connections I really
can't<00:01:23.899> get<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.170> right<00:01:24.350> right<00:01:24.409> now<00:01:24.799> but<00:01:25.299> there's

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
can't get it right right now but there's

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.749 
can't get it right right now but there's
just<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.689> connection<00:01:26.929> for<00:01:27.409> your<00:01:28.039> audio<00:01:28.399> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
just a connection for your audio and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.889 
just a connection for your audio and
your<00:01:29.390> power<00:01:29.630> source<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:32.000> mean<00:01:32.270> it's<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
your power source but I mean it's a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.740 
your power source but I mean it's a
pretty<00:01:33.439> cool<00:01:33.770> little<00:01:34.009> mbb<00:01:34.579> really<00:01:35.090> can't<00:01:35.329> be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
pretty cool little mbb really can't be

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.559 
pretty cool little mbb really can't be
late<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.530> kind<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.829> in<00:01:37.009> there<00:01:37.569> pretty

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
late so it's kind of in there pretty

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.929 
late so it's kind of in there pretty
small<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.780> get<00:01:41.959> this<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:43.759> get

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
small and so then you get this you get

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.370 
small and so then you get this you get
an<00:01:44.149> aux<00:01:44.390> cord<00:01:44.719> double-sided<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:48.170> really

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
an aux cord double-sided it's really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.660 
an aux cord double-sided it's really
cool<00:01:48.590> too<00:01:48.709> it's<00:01:48.829> pretty<00:01:49.099> it<00:01:49.220> looks<00:01:49.429> pretty

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
cool too it's pretty it looks pretty

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.969 
cool too it's pretty it looks pretty
long<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.909> haven't<00:01:50.239> opened<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.810> look<00:01:51.049> pretty

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
long I haven't opened it look pretty

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.819 
long I haven't opened it look pretty
long<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:53.989> the<00:01:54.229> second<00:01:54.649> thing<00:01:54.799> that

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
long and then the second thing that

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.630 
long and then the second thing that
comes<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:57.229> your<00:01:57.380> stereo<00:01:57.890> system<00:01:58.489> or

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
comes with it for your stereo system or

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.949 
comes with it for your stereo system or
whatever<00:01:58.819> you're<00:01:59.119> gonna<00:01:59.209> plug<00:01:59.539> this<00:01:59.689> into

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
whatever you're gonna plug this into

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.370 
whatever you're gonna plug this into
because<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.500> really<00:02:00.799> doesn't<00:02:01.009> matter<00:02:05.380> then

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
because it really doesn't matter then

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.719 
because it really doesn't matter then
you<00:02:06.770> plug<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.969> audio<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.929> back<00:02:09.729> so

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
you plug in the audio in the back so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.170 
you plug in the audio in the back so
it's<00:02:10.879> pretty<00:02:11.150> simple<00:02:11.629> straightforward<00:02:13.180> comes

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
it's pretty simple straightforward comes

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.309 
it's pretty simple straightforward comes
with<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:16.819> little<00:02:16.940> manual<00:02:17.239> Spanish<00:02:18.079> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
with with your little manual Spanish and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.629 
with with your little manual Spanish and
English<00:02:18.470> but<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.459> straight

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
English but then you just go straight

ready to like destroy my room cuz I just

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.009 
ready to like destroy my room cuz I just
purchased<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.820> when<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> have<00:04:21.450> your<00:04:21.570> Xbox

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
purchased it so when you have your Xbox

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.600 
purchased it so when you have your Xbox
on<00:04:22.200> this<00:04:22.410> won't<00:04:22.590> function<00:04:22.800> right<00:04:23.160> next<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.580> it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
on this won't function right next to it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.820 
on this won't function right next to it
it<00:04:23.849> functions<00:04:24.240> right<00:04:24.450> here<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.710> know

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
it functions right here and you know

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.200 
it functions right here and you know
it's<00:04:25.979> not<00:04:26.099> that<00:04:26.160> pretty<00:04:26.340> far<00:04:26.849> but<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.150> think

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it's not that pretty far but I think

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.650 
it's not that pretty far but I think
that's<00:04:27.450> why<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.570> usually<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:29.660> it

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
that's why I usually have it and it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.610 
that's why I usually have it and it
still<00:04:31.020> reaches<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:31.729> once<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:32.910> go<00:04:33.470> all<00:04:34.470> right

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
still reaches so once you go all right

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.290 
still reaches so once you go all right
