00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.730
 I immediately answer the question no is not 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.530
 true that I'm definitely on TV 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.330
 facebook is understanding what i am 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.640

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.230
 video to inform even those you 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.420
 follow on youtube and I'm not up 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.119
 facebook and a few months I've been 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.800
 contacted by the editorial staff of la3 that is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.320
 a channel that is both digital 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.990
 terrestrial that on sky have decided to 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.210
 insert my videos into a program 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.850
 which is called tutorial where exactly 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.480
 certain tutorials are broadcast 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.040
 some youtuber the program is connected 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.920
 to a vote that is carried out on 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.530
 facebook and you can vote for the youtuber that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480
 the more you like it only via facebook 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.780
 the program then goes on all the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.060
 days on the a3 to know the channel of the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.920
 digital terrestrial and sky I refer you 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.150
 to the facebook page or whatever you do 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.519
 I can also write in the box 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.560
 information where I tell you precisely about 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.020
 as a digital terrestrial channel and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.540
 sky you can find the transmission goes 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.730
 aired every day at 17 30 though 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.430
 I know there are replicas either 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.890
 the morning that night very late in 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.140
 deep night to know everyone anyway 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 I refer you to their website and you will have everything 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 as the update of the schedules 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.960
 when there will be replication or when there 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.340
 the program will obviously not be there 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.320
 I can tell when i will go on 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 my tutorials because we are so many 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.940
 and then randomly will be chosen 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.430
 tutorial from youtube for those who then 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.479
 so when you click on which up there 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.790
