my connections are good not sure what's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.159 
my connections are good not sure what's
wrong<00:00:25.399> and<00:00:25.700> they<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.239> not<00:00:26.540> addressed<00:00:26.779> the

address of 31 for some reason 31 is a
unaddressed<00:00:33.460> address<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:35.630> doesn't<00:00:35.960> do

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
unaddressed address so it doesn't do

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.200 
unaddressed address so it doesn't do
anything<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:36.560> basically<00:00:36.950> what<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.910> first
