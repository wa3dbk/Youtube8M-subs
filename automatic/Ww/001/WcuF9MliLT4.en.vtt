establishing the need for something okay
something<00:00:21.840> as<00:00:21.930> simple<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> tire<00:00:22.710> rotation

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
something as simple as a tire rotation

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.970 
something as simple as a tire rotation
it<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.269> something<00:00:24.510> simple<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
it was something simple as a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.200 
it was something simple as a
transmission<00:00:25.980> flush<00:00:26.250> not<00:00:26.789> always<00:00:26.970> too<00:00:27.119> much

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
transmission flush not always too much

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.990 
transmission flush not always too much
the<00:00:27.420> need<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.529> well<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> lot<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> times

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the need for that well a lot of times

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.250 
the need for that well a lot of times
people<00:00:30.269> look<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> transmission<00:00:30.960> fluid

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
people look at the transmission fluid

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
people look at the transmission fluid
they<00:00:31.500> say<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> transmission<00:00:32.520> flow<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
they say well the transmission flow is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.540 
they say well the transmission flow is
black<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.239> therefore<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.660> needs<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.110> done

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
black so therefore it needs to be done

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
black so therefore it needs to be done
wrong<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> ever<00:00:36.840> change<00:00:37.110> oil<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
wrong you know you ever change oil and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
wrong you know you ever change oil and
then<00:00:37.829> immediately<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.489> oil<00:00:38.700> looks<00:00:38.969> dirty

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
then immediately the oil looks dirty

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.459 
then immediately the oil looks dirty
right<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> back<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.170> there's<00:00:40.320> sort<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
right off the back so there's sort of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.470 
right off the back so there's sort of
some<00:00:40.620> crud<00:00:40.860> built<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> engine<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
some crud built up in the engine so you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.569 
some crud built up in the engine so you
can't<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:42.989> color<00:00:43.170> alone<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.340> going

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
can't go by color alone that's not going

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
can't go by color alone that's not going
to<00:00:44.640> work<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.200> we

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to work and then the other one that we

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
to work and then the other one that we
hear<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:47.280> change<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> transmission

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
hear is well change the transmission

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
hear is well change the transmission

cometh on the counter we ask them very

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
cometh on the counter we ask them very
simply<00:01:26.840> when's<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> last<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.530> rotated
