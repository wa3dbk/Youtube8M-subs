00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.860 

and<00:05:34.180> if<00:05:34.420> we<00:05:34.570> put<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:34.930> reverse<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:36.720> can<00:05:37.720> see

you can see the actual back up camera
right<00:05:45.670> there<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.600> let's<00:05:46.810> say<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.020> I'm<00:05:47.140> going<00:05:47.260> to

right there so let's say if I'm going to
go<00:05:47.410> park<00:05:47.680> up<00:05:47.860> next<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.460> Sierra<00:05:49.440> you'll

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
go park up next to the Sierra you'll

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.260 
go park up next to the Sierra you'll
actually<00:05:50.620> begin<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.250> see<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:51.550> on<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.060> left

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
actually begin to see it on the left

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.170 
actually begin to see it on the left
side<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.840> screen

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.150 

let's<00:05:58.810> say<00:05:58.960> you're<00:05:59.140> trying<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.560> connect<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.130> a

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.400 

it's<00:06:09.530> starting<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:09.919> show<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.340> pickup

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
it's starting to show that pickup

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.770 
it's starting to show that pickup
so<00:06:13.010> there's<00:06:13.190> actually<00:06:13.670> an<00:06:13.730> aerial<00:06:14.120> view<00:06:14.150> and

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780
