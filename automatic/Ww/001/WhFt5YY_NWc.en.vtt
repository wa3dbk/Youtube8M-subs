00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey guys welcome to my tech tips today

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys welcome to my tech tips today
I'm<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> speed<00:00:03.959> up

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
I'm going to show you how to speed up

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
I'm going to show you how to speed up
any<00:00:04.440> game<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.250> Steam<00:00:06.710> basically<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.830> works

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
any game on Steam basically it works

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.280 
any game on Steam basically it works
with<00:00:08.429> command<00:00:08.940> lines<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.599> put<00:00:09.809> into<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
with command lines that you put into the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.919 
with command lines that you put into the
launch<00:00:10.769> options<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> game<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.480> every<00:00:12.780> time

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
launch options to the game so every time

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
launch options to the game so every time
you<00:00:13.110> start<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.710> reads<00:00:13.980> these<00:00:14.540> these<00:00:15.540> launch

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
you start it it reads these these launch

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
you start it it reads these these launch
options<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.730> yeah<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> lot<00:00:18.060> quicker

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
options and yeah it's a lot quicker

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.140 
options and yeah it's a lot quicker
so<00:00:19.109> basically<00:00:20.070> I've<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.580> commands<00:00:20.910> down

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
so basically I've got the commands down

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240 
so basically I've got the commands down
here<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.600> I've<00:00:21.689> written<00:00:21.840> into<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.590> little

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
here that I've written into a little

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
here that I've written into a little
WordPad<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.630> gonna<00:00:24.720> explain<00:00:25.050> what<00:00:25.199> they

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
WordPad I'm just gonna explain what they

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.880 
WordPad I'm just gonna explain what they
do<00:00:26.390> sigh<00:00:29.029> -<00:00:30.029> 32-bit<00:00:30.900> basically<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.710> app

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
do sigh - 32-bit basically what app

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
do sigh - 32-bit basically what app
that's<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.340> useful<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:33.350> 64-bit<00:00:34.350> machines<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that's only useful on 64-bit machines so

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.049 
that's only useful on 64-bit machines so
if<00:00:36.120> you're<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.390> running<00:00:36.570> windows<00:00:37.230> 64-bit

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
if you're not running windows 64-bit

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
if you're not running windows 64-bit
don't<00:00:39.059> put<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.600> leave<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.710> out

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
don't put that in leave that one out

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.639 
don't put that in leave that one out
because<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.820> won't<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.149> anything<00:00:42.649> okay

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
because it just won't do anything okay

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.400 
because it just won't do anything okay
the<00:00:43.710> next<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.129> no<00:00:44.430> vid<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.750> simply<00:00:46.170> takes

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the next one no vid this simply takes

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.610 
the next one no vid this simply takes
our<00:00:46.649> intro<00:00:47.100> videos<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> made<00:00:48.899> by<00:00:49.200> or

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
our intro videos so if it's made by or

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
our intro videos so if it's made by or
sponsored<00:00:50.550> by<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.210> Nvidia<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sponsored by something like Nvidia and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
sponsored by something like Nvidia and
has<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.770> splash<00:00:53.010> screen<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
has a little splash screen when it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
has a little splash screen when it
starts<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> takes<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> boots<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> lot

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
starts it takes out so it boots a lot

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.060 
starts it takes out so it boots a lot
quicker<00:00:56.690> -<00:00:57.690> hi

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
quicker - hi

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
quicker - hi
basically<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> does<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.539> actually

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
basically what that does I can actually

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.399 
basically what that does I can actually
show<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:05.460> sec<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> what

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
show you just do this one sec so what

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.310 
show you just do this one sec so what
you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.890> let's<00:01:08.189> say<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.970> chrome<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> be

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you can do let's say I want chrome to be

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.609 
you can do let's say I want chrome to be
really<00:01:11.159> fast<00:01:11.400> okay<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
really fast okay so what you can do is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.670 
really fast okay so what you can do is
right-click<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.810> set<00:01:15.810> priority<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
right-click on it and set priority and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.070 
right-click on it and set priority and
put<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.009> high<00:01:17.250> real<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.390> doesn't<00:01:18.659> rework

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
put it on high real time doesn't rework

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
put it on high real time doesn't rework
a<00:01:19.320> probably<00:01:19.619> crashing<00:01:19.979> machine<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.490> high

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a probably crashing machine but high

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
a probably crashing machine but high
works<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> does<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> allocates

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
works and what that does is it allocates

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.179 
works and what that does is it allocates
more<00:01:23.670> memory<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.390> CPU<00:01:25.110> usage<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
more memory and more CPU usage to the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
more memory and more CPU usage to the
application<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> happen<00:01:28.979> by

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
application so that's going to happen by

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.530 
application so that's going to happen by
default<00:01:29.700> every<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.240> open<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> game

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
default every time you open up the game

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.929 
default every time you open up the game
using<00:01:33.540> high<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.710> next<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> no<00:01:35.430> border

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
using high the next one is no border

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
using high the next one is no border
that's<00:01:36.119> simply<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> run<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> game<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that's simply if you run a game in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
that's simply if you run a game in
Windows<00:01:38.670> mode<00:01:39.140> that'll<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.290> away<00:01:40.470> two

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
Windows mode that'll take away two

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.359 
Windows mode that'll take away two
border<00:01:41.630> doesn't<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> quicker<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:44.100> next

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
border doesn't make it quicker the next

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
border doesn't make it quicker the next
one<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.850> threads<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> works<00:01:46.680> if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
one is threads for now that works if

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.319 
one is threads for now that works if
you've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.500> quad-core<00:01:49.500> CPU<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.329> Intel

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you've got a quad-core CPU like a Intel

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
you've got a quad-core CPU like a Intel
i5<00:01:52.729> I'm<00:01:53.729> using<00:01:54.000> an<00:01:54.149> i7<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.340> actually

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
i5 I'm using an i7 so really actually

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.969 
i5 I'm using an i7 so really actually
said<00:01:56.729> -<00:01:56.880> eight<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> sake<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
said - eight but for the sake of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.030 
said - eight but for the sake of
demonstration<00:01:59.159> doesn't<00:02:00.119> matter<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.770> next

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
demonstration doesn't matter the next

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.600 
demonstration doesn't matter the next
one<00:02:02.189> heap<00:02:02.460> size<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.780> does<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.619> heap

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
one heap size now what that does is heap

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.520 
one heap size now what that does is heap
size<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> amount<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> memory<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
size is the amount of memory is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.999 
size is the amount of memory is
allocated<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.700> our<00:02:08.849> application<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.590> I've

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
allocated for our application so I've

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.740 
allocated for our application so I've
got<00:02:11.310> four<00:02:11.730> gig<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.360> ram

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
got four gig of ram

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
got four gig of ram
so<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> set<00:02:15.230> out<00:02:15.260> two<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.340> zero<00:02:16.370> nine<00:02:16.790> seven<00:02:16.819> one

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so I set out two to zero nine seven one

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.110 
so I set out two to zero nine seven one
five<00:02:17.629> two<00:02:18.019> if<00:02:18.470> you're<00:02:19.040> only<00:02:19.220> using<00:02:19.400> two<00:02:19.819> Giga

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
five two if you're only using two Giga

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.899 
five two if you're only using two Giga
RAM<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.010> basically<00:02:22.220> go<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.790> your

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
RAM then you basically go to your

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.970 
RAM then you basically go to your
calculator<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:23.989> divide<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.530> number<00:02:24.739> by

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
calculator and you divide that number by

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.869 
calculator and you divide that number by
two<00:02:25.450> okay<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:27.079> that<00:02:27.290> number<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:28.189> one

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
two okay and you put that number in one

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.119 
two okay and you put that number in one
lap<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.390> like<00:02:29.659> whatever<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.920> you're

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
lap of like whatever it is if you're

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.100 
lap of like whatever it is if you're
using<00:02:31.159> eight<00:02:31.640> gig<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.450> double<00:02:32.840> it

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
using eight gig you double it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.740 
using eight gig you double it
it's<00:02:33.530> simply<00:02:33.950> allocating<00:02:34.610> half<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.569> amount

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's simply allocating half the amount

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.099 
it's simply allocating half the amount
of<00:02:35.870> RAM<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.440> have<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.099> application

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
of RAM that you have to that application

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.800 
of RAM that you have to that application
and<00:02:39.109> that<00:02:39.349> makes<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.829> lot<00:02:39.980> quicker<00:02:40.810> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and that makes it a lot quicker so

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.229 
and that makes it a lot quicker so
basically<00:02:42.349> just<00:02:43.510> copy<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.750> paste<00:02:44.989> these<00:02:46.239> and

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
basically just copy and paste these and

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.190 
basically just copy and paste these and
you<00:02:47.659> started<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.079> your<00:02:48.230> Steam<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.799> assume<00:02:50.200> so
