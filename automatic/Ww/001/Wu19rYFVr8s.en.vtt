00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
together so looks like these this is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.840 
together so looks like these this is
just<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> stand<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> looks

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
let's move the stand out of the way and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
let's move the stand out of the way and
get<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
get to the back of this so this is like

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
get to the back of this so this is like
a<00:01:41.880> soft<00:01:42.270> plastic<00:01:43.229> rubbery<00:01:43.649> feel<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:44.460> it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a soft plastic rubbery feel now it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060 
a soft plastic rubbery feel now it's
hard<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.119> against<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> white<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
hard to see against the white here but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
hard to see against the white here but
you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> has<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> word<00:01:48.090> contour<00:01:48.750> on

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you can see it has the word contour on

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
you can see it has the word contour on
it<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.710> written<00:01:52.950> behind<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.570> got

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it so it's written behind here it's got

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.660 
it so it's written behind here it's got
like<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> soft<00:01:55.229> rubbery<00:01:55.680> feel<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.520> looks

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
like a soft rubbery feel and it looks

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
like a soft rubbery feel and it looks
like<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.939> iPad<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> sit<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like the iPad is just going to sit in

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.590 
like the iPad is just going to sit in
here<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.310> front<00:01:59.880> piece<00:02:00.119> looks

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
here and then this front piece looks

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
here and then this front piece looks
like<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> clap<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.950> Eric

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
like it's going to clap right on Eric

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.810 
like it's going to clap right on Eric
clip<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> front<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:04.820> assuming

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
clip right on the front now assuming

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.520 
clip right on the front now assuming
this<00:02:06.000> hole<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> ambient<00:02:07.290> light

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this hole here is for the ambient light

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.490 
this hole here is for the ambient light
sensor<00:02:08.450> possibly<00:02:09.450> future<00:02:09.810> camera<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> don't

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
sensor possibly future camera I don't

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
sensor possibly future camera I don't
know<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:11.129> probably<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.790> ambient<00:02:12.150> light

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
know but probably the ambient light

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300 
know but probably the ambient light
sensor<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.319> let<00:02:13.739> me<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.950> ahead

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
sensor so let me go ahead

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.070 
sensor so let me go ahead
and<00:02:15.380> use<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> couple<00:02:17.220> days<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
and use this for a couple days so this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.240 
and use this for a couple days so this
is<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.450> case<00:02:22.080> itself<00:02:22.530> looks<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.099> we've

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
is the the case itself looks like we've

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.850 
is the the case itself looks like we've
got<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.520> stand<00:02:23.900> use<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.349> couple<00:02:25.530> days

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
got to stand use this for a couple days

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
got to stand use this for a couple days
and<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.970> what<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:29.760> how<00:02:29.910> how<00:02:30.360> it

it<00:04:39.009> looks<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:40.419> going<00:04:40.569> to<00:04:40.630> go<00:04:40.780> together

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
it looks like it's going to go together

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.540 
it looks like it's going to go together
like<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.960> there<00:04:44.349> we<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.400> goes

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
like this there we go so it goes

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.740 
like this there we go so it goes
together<00:04:45.729> like<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.210> an<00:04:46.300> X<00:04:46.569> here<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:48.539> it<00:04:49.539> looks

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
together like in an X here and it looks

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.870 
together like in an X here and it looks
like<00:04:49.840> we<00:04:50.050> can<00:04:50.199> prop<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.800> ipad<00:04:51.250> ipad<00:04:51.639> up<00:04:51.819> a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
like we can prop the ipad ipad up a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640 
like we can prop the ipad ipad up a
couple<00:04:52.120> different<00:04:52.509> ways<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.440> looks<00:04:53.560> like

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
couple different ways so it looks like

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.670 
couple different ways so it looks like
we<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:53.979> prop<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.250> sideways<00:04:55.139> at<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.440> angle

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
we can prop it sideways at that angle

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.680 
we can prop it sideways at that angle
for<00:04:57.580> typing<00:04:57.610> or<00:04:58.300> or<00:04:59.110> watching<00:04:59.970> videos<00:05:00.970> it's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
for typing or or watching videos it's

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.129 
for typing or or watching videos it's
like<00:05:01.810> we<00:05:01.900> can<00:05:02.020> also<00:05:02.259> prop<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.830> up<00:05:02.889> this<00:05:03.160> way

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
like we can also prop it up this way

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.260 
like we can also prop it up this way
yeah<00:05:05.139> so<00:05:05.979> we<00:05:06.099> can<00:05:06.250> prop<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.490> up<00:05:06.669> on<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.090> legs

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
yeah so we can prop it up on the legs

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.520 
yeah so we can prop it up on the legs
here<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.690> can<00:05:07.810> see<00:05:08.020> that's<00:05:08.199> a<00:05:08.289> little<00:05:08.440> bit

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
here you can see that's a little bit

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.950 
here you can see that's a little bit
difficult<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:09.039> this<00:05:09.130> bright<00:05:09.460> light<00:05:09.870> but<00:05:10.870> you

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
difficult in this bright light but you

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.029 
difficult in this bright light but you
can<00:05:11.199> see<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:12.599> there<00:05:13.599> we<00:05:13.720> go<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.710> might<00:05:14.860> help

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
can see that there we go that might help

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.279 
can see that there we go that might help
a<00:05:15.160> little<00:05:15.190> bit<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.449> leaves<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.110> back

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
a little bit so that leaves the back

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.649 
a little bit so that leaves the back
exposed<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.159> is<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.280> fairly<00:05:18.669> nice-lookin<00:05:19.419> case

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
exposed it is a fairly nice-lookin case

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.070 
exposed it is a fairly nice-lookin case
there's<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.830> back<00:05:21.120> nice<00:05:22.120> support<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.780> the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
there's the back nice support in the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.420 
there's the back nice support in the
back<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.889> like<00:05:24.070> these<00:05:24.220> little

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
back you do have like these little

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.909 
back you do have like these little
rubber<00:05:24.699> feet<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.330> bottom<00:05:25.650> with<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.680> little

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
rubber feet on the bottom with a little

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.960 
rubber feet on the bottom with a little
bit<00:05:27.039> of<00:05:27.069> grip<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.900> that's<00:05:29.080> pretty<00:05:29.319> nice<00:05:29.970> again

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
bit of grip so that's pretty nice again

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.820 
bit of grip so that's pretty nice again
you<00:05:31.930> can<00:05:31.960> set<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.349> like<00:05:32.560> this<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.990> watch<00:05:35.199> not

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
you can set it like this to watch not

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.710 
you can set it like this to watch not
quite<00:05:36.130> as<00:05:36.250> secure<00:05:36.639> but<00:05:36.849> doesn't<00:05:37.419> need<00:05:37.509> to<00:05:37.630> be

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
quite as secure but doesn't need to be

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.529 
quite as secure but doesn't need to be
as<00:05:37.840> it's<00:05:38.020> laying<00:05:38.229> flat<00:05:38.560> now<00:05:39.370> let<00:05:39.970> me<00:05:40.000> grab<00:05:40.330> the

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
as it's laying flat now let me grab the

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.390 
as it's laying flat now let me grab the
doc<00:05:40.750> because<00:05:41.199> I'm<00:05:41.289> thinking<00:05:41.740> this<00:05:41.860> might<00:05:42.039> fit

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
doc because I'm thinking this might fit

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.920 
doc because I'm thinking this might fit
on<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.699> dock<00:05:42.880> which<00:05:43.120> would<00:05:43.270> be<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.389> really<00:05:43.659> nice

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
on the dock which would be a really nice

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.270 
on the dock which would be a really nice
feature<00:05:44.199> of<00:05:44.349> this<00:05:44.590> case<00:05:44.830> so<00:05:45.039> let<00:05:45.159> me<00:05:45.250> check

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
feature of this case so let me check

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.260 
feature of this case so let me check
that<00:05:45.699> out<00:05:45.729> again<00:05:46.659> I'll<00:05:46.780> be<00:05:46.930> right<00:05:47.169> back<00:05:47.320> okay

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
that out again I'll be right back okay

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.709 
that out again I'll be right back okay
so<00:05:49.270> I've<00:05:49.419> gotten<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.870> doc<00:05:50.280> here<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:51.370> is

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
so I've gotten the doc here it is

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.850 
so I've gotten the doc here it is
disconnected<00:05:52.719> of<00:05:52.810> course<00:05:53.050> let's<00:05:53.590> go<00:05:53.680> ahead

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
disconnected of course let's go ahead

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.040 
disconnected of course let's go ahead
and<00:05:53.979> sit<00:05:54.250> this<00:05:54.370> here<00:05:55.380> and<00:05:56.380> see<00:05:56.740> what<00:05:56.770> we<00:05:57.009> have

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
and sit this here and see what we have

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.390 
and sit this here and see what we have
pretty<00:05:59.050> tight<00:05:59.259> fit<00:05:59.590> but<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.979> can<00:06:00.159> certainly

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
pretty tight fit but you can certainly

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.320 
pretty tight fit but you can certainly
use<00:06:00.639> it<00:06:00.940> on<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.150> dock<00:06:01.650> not<00:06:02.650> sure<00:06:03.159> if<00:06:03.909> it<00:06:04.180> will

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
use it on the dock not sure if it will

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.080 
use it on the dock not sure if it will
work<00:06:04.860> plugged<00:06:05.860> in<00:06:06.099> let's<00:06:06.340> see<00:06:06.580> how<00:06:06.699> that<00:06:06.759> dock

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
work plugged in let's see how that dock

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.629 
work plugged in let's see how that dock
connector<00:06:07.570> kinds<00:06:08.159> well<00:06:09.159> it's<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.490> right

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
connector kinds well it's the right

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.310 
connector kinds well it's the right
width<00:06:09.909> for<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.300> whole<00:06:10.449> dock<00:06:10.659> connector<00:06:11.080> so<00:06:11.229> it

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
width for the whole dock connector so it

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.070 
width for the whole dock connector so it
should<00:06:11.469> work<00:06:11.620> just<00:06:11.680> fine<00:06:12.690> so<00:06:13.690> that's<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:14.050> really

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
should work just fine so that's a really

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.230 
should work just fine so that's a really
nice<00:06:14.590> feature<00:06:14.919> of<00:06:15.190> this<00:06:15.310> case<00:06:15.639> that's<00:06:15.969> one<00:06:16.150> of

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
nice feature of this case that's one of

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.420 
nice feature of this case that's one of
the<00:06:16.330> disadvantages<00:06:16.509> to<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:17.349> apple<00:06:17.740> case<00:06:17.860> is

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
the disadvantages to the apple case is

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.189 
the disadvantages to the apple case is
you<00:06:18.580> can't<00:06:18.789> set<00:06:19.060> it<00:06:19.090> in<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.360> dock<00:06:19.539> and<00:06:19.570> use<00:06:19.990> it

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
you can't set it in the dock and use it

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.709 
you can't set it in the dock and use it
but<00:06:20.770> this<00:06:20.919> it<00:06:21.130> looks<00:06:21.219> like<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.550> can<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:22.539> that's

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
but this it looks like you can so that's

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.379 
but this it looks like you can so that's
really<00:06:23.110> nice<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.710> do<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.340> have<00:06:24.729> now<00:06:25.270> again

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
really nice to do I have now again

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.089 
really nice to do I have now again
there's<00:06:25.719> no<00:06:25.780> screen<00:06:26.169> protector<00:06:26.710> so<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:26.919> may

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
there's no screen protector so you may

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.800 
there's no screen protector so you may
want<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.310> get<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:27.490> screen<00:06:27.759> protector<00:06:27.940> for<00:06:28.539> if

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
want to get a screen protector for if

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.830 
want to get a screen protector for if
you're<00:06:28.930> going<00:06:29.080> to<00:06:29.199> use<00:06:29.440> this<00:06:29.650> case<00:06:30.750> other<00:06:31.750> than

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
you're going to use this case other than

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.209
