might be able to block the attack when

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.220 
might be able to block the attack when
he<00:03:01.560> does<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.750> red<00:03:04.400> staff<00:03:05.400> attack<00:03:06.230> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
might be able to block it if you have a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.570 
might be able to block it if you have a
good<00:03:09.420> enough<00:03:09.510> he'll<00:03:09.930> usually<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:11.250> will<00:03:11.430> hurt

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
good enough he'll usually it will hurt

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.780 
good enough he'll usually it will hurt
you<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.200> would<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.739> recommend<00:03:13.980> trying<00:03:14.519> to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you so I would just recommend trying to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
you so I would just recommend trying to
stay<00:03:15.120> out<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.629> way<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.080> rather<00:03:16.260> than

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
stay out of the way of it rather than

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.890 
stay out of the way of it rather than
trying<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.860> block<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.879> does<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.920 

I<00:03:22.989> actually<00:03:23.620> kind<00:03:24.129> of<00:03:24.599> stumbled<00:03:25.599> onto<00:03:25.750> this

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
I actually kind of stumbled onto this

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.270 
I actually kind of stumbled onto this
method<00:03:26.500> by<00:03:26.650> accident<00:03:27.720> before<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.829> tried

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
method by accident before this I I tried

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.330 
method by accident before this I I tried
to<00:03:30.459> kill<00:03:30.640> him<00:03:31.110> homeboys<00:03:32.110> at<00:03:32.439> least<00:03:32.709> 10<00:03:32.920> or<00:03:33.040> 15

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
to kill him homeboys at least 10 or 15

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.890 
to kill him homeboys at least 10 or 15
times<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:35.530> finally<00:03:36.159> realized<00:03:36.909> that<00:03:37.150> my<00:03:37.689> eye

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
times and I finally realized that my eye

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.509 
times and I finally realized that my eye
it<00:03:38.349> wasn't<00:03:38.650> working<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:39.159> because<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.420> a

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
it wasn't working is because the a

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.770 
it wasn't working is because the a
couple<00:03:42.519> pieces<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.879> lumber<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.599> was

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
couple pieces of lumber that I was

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.649 
couple pieces of lumber that I was
wearing<00:03:44.049> was<00:03:44.530> too<00:03:44.859> heavy<00:03:45.159> and<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:46.299> was<00:03:46.329> really

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
wearing was too heavy and it was really

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.929 
wearing was too heavy and it was really
slowing<00:03:47.140> me<00:03:47.260> down<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.069> I<00:03:48.099> couldn't<00:03:48.370> perform<00:03:48.609> my

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
slowing me down so I couldn't perform my

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.740 
slowing me down so I couldn't perform my
roles<00:03:49.500> as<00:03:50.500> math<00:03:50.859> my<00:03:51.700> rules<00:03:51.970> were<00:03:52.180> really<00:03:52.450> slow

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
roles as math my rules were really slow

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.630 
roles as math my rules were really slow
so<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.439> realized<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.069> once<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.310> took<00:03:54.370> those

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
so I realized that once I took those

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.330 
so I realized that once I took those
pieces<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:55.000> going<00:03:55.180> wrong<00:03:55.389> hey<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.590> was<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.069> lot

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
pieces of going wrong hey I was a lot

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.339 
pieces of going wrong hey I was a lot
faster<00:03:57.959> so<00:04:00.060> had<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.269> us<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.409> that's<00:04:02.590> when<00:04:02.769> I

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
faster so had that us so that's when I

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.710 
faster so had that us so that's when I
that's<00:04:05.349> when<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.530> made<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.799> decision<00:04:06.720> that

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
that's when I made the decision that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.990 
that's when I made the decision that
speed<00:04:08.680> was<00:04:08.980> more<00:04:09.280> important<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.760> me<00:04:09.849> than

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
speed was more important to me than

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.429 
speed was more important to me than
defense<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.049> so<00:04:11.980> after<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:12.689> way<00:04:13.689> still<00:04:13.959> took

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
defense and so after I way still took

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.319 
defense and so after I way still took
off<00:04:14.620> those<00:04:14.859> heavy<00:04:15.129> harmless<00:04:15.579> replacing<00:04:16.150> for

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
off those heavy harmless replacing for

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.740 
off those heavy harmless replacing for
lighter<00:04:16.539> armors<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:19.180> was<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.359> lot<00:04:19.570> easier<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
lighter armors it was a lot easier so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.499 
lighter armors it was a lot easier so
