00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 greetings to all friends of 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.500
 androidworld.it today is Friday, May 30th 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.710
 and these are two minutes with android 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.710
 world 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 lg also finally presented his 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 top of the range for 2014 now the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.840
 panorama is complete the company wanted 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.520
 beyond itself and probably the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.590
 attempt is also to overcome the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.690
 competition the body this time 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 removable in plastic but to the touch e 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.470
 we can guarantee this for you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 it really looks like metal and is therefore 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.120
 fine the camera keeps it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.830
 optical image stabilizer 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 gains a laser autofocus that allows 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.420
 to focus instantly and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.140
 especially in any condition 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.820
 brightness 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 finally, he also earns love 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.079
 expandable and above all it is the only one in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.380
 coming soon to have a qhd screen 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 to be precise 2k in the middle 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.890
 we hope to try it soon so as to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 let you know if all the premises yes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 will really turn one plus into reality 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.759
 one has arrived but only in our hands 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 in fact, buying one will not be at all 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.289
 simple thing but in the meantime we have it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 proven our judgment on this is 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.800
 more than positive especially thanks 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 to the last update that in practice 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.080
 all defects solved in one fell swoop 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.780
 of which this smartphone unfortunately was 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 plagued the demonstration of how to have 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.409
 an active team like that of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 cyanogenmod can really do the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 difference 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.619
 after the avalanche of problems due to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.070
 fort bleed now new leaks of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.659
 security affects the android world 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.580
 after you had to change the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.860
 outlets and cerberus password is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.799
 unfortunately the moment has arrived 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.630
 also change the ebay password too 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.580
 because otherwise you can no longer use 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.450
 their service luckily paypal is al 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.670
 sure 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.290
 yesterday, however, it was also the turn to spotify not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.270
 in this case you have to change none 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.950
 password but a security flaw that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 could have compromised the keys of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.689
 company encryption force the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.119
 itself to upload a new version of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.710
 spotify on the play stop totally 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.770
 disconnected the previous one and that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.629
 will force all the interiors 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.369
 in the service to download again 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.369
 Offline all your playlists
