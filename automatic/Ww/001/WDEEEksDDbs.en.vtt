heat<00:00:16.020> pressure<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.890> time<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.250> form<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.150> how

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
heat pressure and time to form so how

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.960 
heat pressure and time to form so how
did<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.810> did<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.859> pop<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> into
