00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.710

 The sixth is the Herald in the Maybelline Highlighting Blush . 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 It's a little bit different from the pitch color, but the glitter is similar. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.540
 I put it last. I put a long baggage on it and made it easy to compare. 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.299
 When I put it on my face, the foundation was slightly moistened on my arm. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.240
 To show the same color when applied to face rather than the number of fingers 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.560
 I used a brush. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:42.020

 At the far right is Mac's p chicken, which is similar in pitch to pink and has a gold shimmer. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.670

 The second Milanese route is similar to the golden plant, 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.459

 I think it's color. 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:01.470
 I think it's better to use a blade that looks fresh and has a moderately shimmer . 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:06.420
