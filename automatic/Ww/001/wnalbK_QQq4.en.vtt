00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:56.860 

dougies<00:00:28.740> gout<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.519> finish<00:00:31.250> okay

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.869 

hmm

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
hmm

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.580

he's<00:00:59.210> big

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
he's big

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.840 
he's big
so<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.220> think<00:01:01.400> he<00:01:01.910> I<00:01:02.390> don't<00:01:02.750> know<00:01:02.870> how<00:01:03.020> big<00:01:03.290> he<00:01:03.470> is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
so I think he I don't know how big he is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.130 
so I think he I don't know how big he is
but<00:01:04.850> I'm<00:01:05.030> trying<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.360> keep<00:01:05.570> him<00:01:05.780> off<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.310> edge

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
but I'm trying to keep him off that edge

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.690 
but I'm trying to keep him off that edge
because<00:01:09.140> if<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.410> gets<00:01:09.530> too<00:01:09.680> much<00:01:10.010> on<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.400> edge

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
because if it gets too much on that edge

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.640 
because if it gets too much on that edge
right<00:01:11.000> there
