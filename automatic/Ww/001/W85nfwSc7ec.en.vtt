00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.509
 hello welcome to my channel vilma life 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.160
 I know there are many girls who are 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.460
 going through the transition process 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.350
 and they want more clarification and today I bring you 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.740
 tips that can help you for the 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.050
 process of transition set number 1 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.220
 the first thing is to stop using the chemical 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.769
 of the maker or permanent so that the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.779
 hair recovers and the second thing that I 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.029
 I can tell you is to stop using the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.880
 iron I have several girls that I 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.120
 they ask I have enough years using the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.180
 iron and my hair no longer curls like 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.489
 before twins are not the same I want 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.140
 go back to my curly hair and what 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.989
 first thing that I tell you is that you have to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.750
 stop using the iron because if it does not go 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.510
 to continue to damage the hair and it is not going to 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.699
 curl as before but many girls 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.219
 they think that after leaving the iron 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.489
 the next day the hair will be curly 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.829
 as before but that is not the case anymore 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.190
 hair is damaged in the structure of the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.340
 hair is no longer the same the hair is going 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.690
 to be more straight on the same plate 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 that the permanent 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.560
 stretch the hair in such a way that it 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.880
 changes the structure of the hair and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 then your hair is not going to curl 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.010
 as before it was going to take quite some time 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 to make your hair curl again I know 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.870
 how it curled up before the other thing is that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.840
 has to have a goal the goal of I believe 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.270
 I'm going to spend six months without using anything 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 of blower nothing of chemical products that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.510
 they are going to empty my hair and have to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.050
 Take this time to let your 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.960
 hair recover do not apply anything 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.480
 that can damage your hair make sure 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.000
 keep the hair hydrated in the 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.060
 night in a spray bottle you're going to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.400
 pour water a little bit of oil and a 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.050
 little bit of conditioner and add it 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 in the hair before going to sleep 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 to keep the hair hydrated 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.600
 while you are going through the process of 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.660
 the transition you will have two textures 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.860
 one laugh and the other list I suggest you 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.470
 use flexi bucks and use the rolos 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.630
 you can also use and also do 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.570
 thirty fabrics as what are called 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.330
 tweets that are the lines or the presses 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.970
 double so that it has a single texture and 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.760
 the hair was more curly the other 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.910
 thing you can do is make yourself the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.580
 bichi what they call the big court if you 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.680
 you do not want to have two texture is to cut yourself 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 the hair I personally had to 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.140
 cut the hair three times to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.860
 take away all that damage so you 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.470
 I suggest you do the vix up or take it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.769
 with patience little by little cutting him 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.959
 little by little many people do not want 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.070
 cut your hair for nothing but already 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.710
 that would be your decision and most 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.700
 important of all this is the 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.230
 patience you have to have patience 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.690
 because the hair is not going to 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.720
 recover from night to morning now 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.570
 same your hair is damaged so 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.780
 least within six months will see 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.640
 a difference or within a year but 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.890
 you're going to have to have patience because 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.130
 although you stopped using the iron today 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.530
 tomorrow that hair has not stabilized 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.910
 you're going to have a very happy texture 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.860
 at the beginning and it's the truth but what 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.670
 have to do as I told you is to use it 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.770
 flexi you're going to make yourself a bow or style 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.430
 prospective that are the braids of 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.170
 double and that helps a lot 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.020
 temporarily so that the hair is 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.730
 see one texture the other thing with the 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.010
 that you have to be careful is with the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.520
 peroxide because peroxide changes the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.370
 texture and like the permanent and that 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.430
 the chemicals the peroxide that is used to 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.440
 the white of the hair changes the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.110
 texture I have a girl who told me look 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.250
 I've been using peroxide for a year 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.640
 start my hair 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.310
 nice it was nice my curls met me 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.920
 They were very beautiful and now I do not have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.609
 curl good what has happened is that the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.250
 peroxide changed that texture and now 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.270
 is smooth is damaged at this time 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.310
 is in a very strong damage process 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.500
 you have to be careful because you can 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.890
 start from nothing so be careful 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.310
 when you comb them when you tie them 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.560
 that is not worth much that does not want it 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.650
 only because you stopped using the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.230
 iron or what chemical the hair is going to 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.020
 come back tomorrow apply conditioner 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.150
 and already the hair is going to get fixed that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.700
 it's not going to be the case it's going to take quite 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.090
 time for your hair to be again 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.040
 what it was before and it has curled up if 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.790
 you follow these tips with great patience 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.770
 you are going to have your curly hair again 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.910

 Then I love you very much 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.950
 the first thing you have to do to 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.950
 give recovery 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.610
