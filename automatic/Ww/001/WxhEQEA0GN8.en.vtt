I<00:03:09.879> made<00:03:10.879> some<00:03:11.180> supports<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.500> my<00:03:13.129> upper<00:03:13.489> bin<00:03:13.870> by

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
I made some supports for my upper bin by

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.050 
I made some supports for my upper bin by
cutting<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> bottoms<00:03:16.010> out<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.670> couple

that<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.870> put<00:03:21.079> in<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.410> bottom<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:22.400> work

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
that you put in the bottom or work

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
that you put in the bottom or work
perfectly<00:03:23.209> fine<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.980> reason<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.280> I'm

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
perfectly fine and the reason that I'm

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.910 
perfectly fine and the reason that I'm
doing<00:03:25.609> this<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.359> just<00:03:26.630> place<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.470> top

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
doing this is if you just place the top

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.479 
doing this is if you just place the top
upper<00:03:28.310> bin<00:03:29.049> inside<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.290> lower<00:03:30.470> bin<00:03:30.769> it's

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
upper bin inside the lower bin it's

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.339 
upper bin inside the lower bin it's
going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> end<00:03:31.910> up<00:03:32.000> getting<00:03:32.269> wedged<00:03:32.569> down<00:03:32.930> and

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
going to end up getting wedged down and

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.349 
going to end up getting wedged down and
it's<00:03:33.739> going<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.040> impede<00:03:34.370> air<00:03:34.670> flow<00:03:34.970> which<00:03:35.329> is

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
it's going to impede air flow which is

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.789 
it's going to impede air flow which is
the<00:03:35.510> whole<00:03:35.690> point<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.049> setting<00:03:36.349> up<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.590> type

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
the whole point of setting up this type

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.849 
the whole point of setting up this type
of<00:03:36.829> vent<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:38.480> allow<00:03:38.870> for<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.200> lot<00:03:39.319> of<00:03:39.380> airflow

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
of vent is to allow for a lot of airflow

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.099 
of vent is to allow for a lot of airflow
and<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.639> allow<00:03:40.819> for<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> nice<00:03:41.299> drainage<00:03:41.870> of

rescue<00:04:38.210> them<00:04:38.389> from<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:39.500> water<00:04:39.860> that's<00:04:40.159> down

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
rescue them from the water that's down

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.730 
rescue them from the water that's down
below<00:04:42.069> next<00:04:43.069> we're<00:04:43.189> going<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.340> stack<00:04:43.610> our<00:04:43.819> bins

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
below next we're going to stack our bins

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.529 
below next we're going to stack our bins
so<00:04:45.740> simply<00:04:46.159> place<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.789> bin<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.419> we've

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
so simply place the bin that we've

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.499 
so simply place the bin that we've
drilled<00:04:47.780> all<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> holes<00:04:48.259> in<00:04:48.789> inside<00:04:49.789> the

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
drilled all the holes in inside the

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.790 
drilled all the holes in inside the
reservoir<00:04:50.960> bin<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.270> voila<00:04:53.270> our<00:04:53.629> bin<00:04:54.439> is<00:04:54.469> ready

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
reservoir bin and voila our bin is ready

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.110 
reservoir bin and voila our bin is ready
to<00:04:54.979> be<00:04:55.069> filled<00:04:57.490> what<00:04:58.490> we're<00:04:58.610> going<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:58.759> start

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
to be filled what we're going to start

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.020 
to be filled what we're going to start
with<00:04:59.389> is<00:04:59.659> some<00:04:59.719> bedding<00:05:00.440> material<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.039> of

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
with is some bedding material and of

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.610 
with is some bedding material and of
course<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.360> can't<00:05:02.539> add<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.960> when<00:05:03.319> it's<00:05:03.469> all

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
course you can't add it when it's all

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.680 
course you can't add it when it's all
big<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:03.949> bulky<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.879> so<00:05:05.539> it<00:05:05.629> really

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
big and bulky like that so it really

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.439 
big and bulky like that so it really
helps<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.469> shred<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.099> down<00:05:07.419> aside<00:05:08.419> from

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
helps to shred it down aside from

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.770 
helps to shred it down aside from
allowing<00:05:09.440> you<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.770> get<00:05:09.889> more<00:05:10.159> in<00:05:10.400> your<00:05:10.520> bin

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
allowing you to get more in your bin

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.379 
allowing you to get more in your bin
this<00:05:11.780> also<00:05:12.500> will<00:05:13.250> help<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.669> speed<00:05:13.909> up<00:05:14.090> the

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
this also will help to speed up the

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.270 
this also will help to speed up the
decomposition<00:05:14.650> process<00:05:15.650> because<00:05:16.069> there's

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
decomposition process because there's

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.659 
decomposition process because there's
more<00:05:16.430> surface<00:05:16.639> area<00:05:16.940> for<00:05:17.479> microbes<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.669> react

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
more surface area for microbes to react

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.580 
more surface area for microbes to react
on<00:05:22.090> start<00:05:23.090> by<00:05:23.180> adding<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.599> nice<00:05:23.840> thick<00:05:24.169> layer<00:05:24.560> of

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
on start by adding a nice thick layer of

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.749 
on start by adding a nice thick layer of
this<00:05:25.039> bedding<00:05:25.279> material<00:05:25.819> in<00:05:25.969> your<00:05:26.479> bin<00:05:26.659> and

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
this bedding material in your bin and

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.390 
this bedding material in your bin and
then<00:05:28.759> of<00:05:28.969> course<00:05:29.210> we're<00:05:29.419> ready<00:05:29.629> to<00:05:29.960> add<00:05:30.400> some

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
then of course we're ready to add some

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.209 
then of course we're ready to add some
food<00:05:31.610> wastes<00:05:32.199> so<00:05:33.199> I<00:05:33.289> add<00:05:33.379> a<00:05:33.409> good<00:05:33.650> thick<00:05:33.889> layer

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
food wastes so I add a good thick layer

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.129 
food wastes so I add a good thick layer
of<00:05:34.490> food<00:05:34.789> waste<00:05:35.710> some<00:05:36.710> more<00:05:36.889> bedding<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:38.210> then

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
of food waste some more bedding and then

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.689 
of food waste some more bedding and then
some<00:05:39.319> more<00:05:39.469> food<00:05:39.620> waste<00:05:39.889> it's<00:05:40.159> good<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.430> get<00:05:40.639> a

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
some more food waste it's good to get a

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.339 
some more food waste it's good to get a
nice<00:05:40.940> layer<00:05:41.330> system<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.960> don't<00:05:42.020> want<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.259> add

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
nice layer system you don't want to add

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.529 
nice layer system you don't want to add
too<00:05:42.560> much<00:05:42.680> food<00:05:42.919> waste<00:05:43.099> in<00:05:43.400> any<00:05:44.000> one<00:05:44.210> layer

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
too much food waste in any one layer

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.050 
too much food waste in any one layer
this<00:05:45.289> helps<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.800> balance<00:05:45.919> things<00:05:46.400> out<00:05:46.580> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.670 

recommend<00:05:50.060> adding<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.449> little<00:05:51.020> bit<00:05:51.139> of<00:05:51.289> garden

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
recommend adding a little bit of garden

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.230 
recommend adding a little bit of garden
soil<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:52.190> definitely<00:05:52.699> don't<00:05:52.789> want<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.089> add

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
soil you definitely don't want to add

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.469 
soil you definitely don't want to add
very<00:05:53.659> much<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.169> all<00:05:54.520> garden<00:05:55.520> soil<00:05:55.789> is<00:05:55.879> a<00:05:56.060> good

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
very much at all garden soil is a good

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:57.909 
very much at all garden soil is a good
thing<00:05:56.629> to<00:05:56.750> add<00:05:56.839> to<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.050> worm<00:05:57.229> bin<00:05:57.409> just<00:05:57.589> because

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
thing to add to a worm bin just because

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.769 
thing to add to a worm bin just because
it<00:05:58.099> can<00:05:58.310> kick-start<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:59.120> microbial

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
it can kick-start the microbial

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.959 
it can kick-start the microbial
community<00:06:00.379> and<00:06:00.860> it<00:06:01.190> also<00:06:01.279> adds<00:06:01.550> a<00:06:01.639> little<00:06:01.789> bit

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969 
community and it also adds a little bit

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.180 
community and it also adds a little bit

bit of a rebel this time around I've

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.119 
bit of a rebel this time around I've
added<00:06:25.580> some<00:06:25.940> of<00:06:25.969> those<00:06:26.750> risky<00:06:27.379> foods<00:06:27.680> some<00:06:28.039> of

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:28.129 
added some of those risky foods some of

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.820 
added some of those risky foods some of
the<00:06:28.219> citrus<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:29.029> onion<00:06:29.389> and<00:06:29.659> the<00:06:30.529> bread

really what I'm trying to prove here is

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.439 
really what I'm trying to prove here is
that<00:06:33.699> adding<00:06:34.699> these<00:06:34.819> materials<00:06:35.360> in

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
that adding these materials in

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.490 
that adding these materials in
moderation<00:06:35.870> is<00:06:36.169> not<00:06:36.380> anything<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:37.250> wor

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
moderation is not anything to wor

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.140 
moderation is not anything to wor
about<00:06:38.060> so<00:06:39.060> do<00:06:39.240> keep<00:06:39.390> that<00:06:39.450> in<00:06:39.690> mind<00:06:41.060> next<00:06:42.060> we're

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
about so do keep that in mind next we're

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.090 
about so do keep that in mind next we're
going<00:06:42.240> to<00:06:42.360> want<00:06:42.540> to<00:06:42.690> moisten<00:06:43.380> our<00:06:43.650> system<00:06:44.010> a

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
going to want to moisten our system a

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.290 
going to want to moisten our system a
little<00:06:44.190> bit<00:06:44.340> you<00:06:44.700> don't<00:06:44.760> have<00:06:44.910> to<00:06:45.000> worry<00:06:45.180> about

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
little bit you don't have to worry about

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.850 
little bit you don't have to worry about
it<00:06:45.510> too<00:06:45.630> much<00:06:45.660> since<00:06:46.170> the<00:06:46.440> food<00:06:46.650> waste

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
it too much since the food waste

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.310 
it too much since the food waste
themselves<00:06:47.610> will<00:06:47.760> help<00:06:47.970> to<00:06:48.270> moisten<00:06:49.080> the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
themselves will help to moisten the

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.610 
themselves will help to moisten the
system<00:06:49.680> but<00:06:50.460> it<00:06:50.520> doesn't<00:06:50.760> hurt<00:06:50.880> to<00:06:51.180> add<00:06:52.050> enough

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
system but it doesn't hurt to add enough

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.600 
system but it doesn't hurt to add enough
water<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.370> soak<00:06:53.580> down<00:06:53.910> that<00:06:54.180> upper<00:06:54.480> layer<00:06:54.720> and

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.400 

finally<00:06:59.610> we're<00:06:59.730> going<00:06:59.760> to<00:06:59.910> add<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.420> one<00:07:00.990> last

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
finally we're going to add a one last

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.760 
finally we're going to add a one last
layer<00:07:01.830> of<00:07:01.860> bedding<00:07:02.250> over<00:07:02.940> the<00:07:03.060> top<00:07:03.240> and<00:07:04.230> of

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
layer of bedding over the top and of

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.210 
layer of bedding over the top and of
course<00:07:04.980> give<00:07:05.250> it<00:07:05.400> a<00:07:05.580> bit<00:07:05.880> of<00:07:05.910> a<00:07:06.090> soaking<00:07:06.750> and<00:07:07.220> we

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
course give it a bit of a soaking and we

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.300 
course give it a bit of a soaking and we
are<00:07:08.400> ready<00:07:08.700> to<00:07:08.880> close<00:07:09.150> up<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.750> system<00:07:11.750> now<00:07:13.310> we

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
are ready to close up the system now we

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.120 
are ready to close up the system now we
can<00:07:14.460> simply<00:07:14.880> let<00:07:15.120> our<00:07:15.390> bin<00:07:15.720> sit<00:07:16.140> for<00:07:17.070> a<00:07:17.100> good

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
can simply let our bin sit for a good

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.800 
can simply let our bin sit for a good
one<00:07:17.400> to<00:07:17.580> two<00:07:17.730> weeks<00:07:17.910> a<00:07:18.240> lot<00:07:18.510> of<00:07:18.600> people

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
one to two weeks a lot of people

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.240 
one to two weeks a lot of people
recommend<00:07:19.110> just<00:07:19.410> adding<00:07:19.710> the<00:07:19.770> worms<00:07:19.980> right

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
recommend just adding the worms right

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.450 
recommend just adding the worms right
away<00:07:20.520> I<00:07:20.840> personally<00:07:21.840> find<00:07:22.200> that<00:07:22.560> letting<00:07:23.310> your

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
away I personally find that letting your

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.270 
away I personally find that letting your
bin<00:07:23.640> sit<00:07:24.350> for<00:07:25.350> a<00:07:25.380> period<00:07:25.830> of<00:07:25.919> time<00:07:26.270> helps<00:07:27.270> a<00:07:27.419> lot

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 
bin sit for a period of time helps a lot

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.200 
bin sit for a period of time helps a lot
it<00:07:29.280> allows<00:07:29.580> for<00:07:30.270> the<00:07:30.919> microbe<00:07:31.919> community<00:07:32.610> to

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
it allows for the microbe community to

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.690 
it allows for the microbe community to
develop<00:07:33.390> quite<00:07:34.110> nicely<00:07:34.350> and<00:07:34.710> it<00:07:35.250> also<00:07:35.370> allows

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
develop quite nicely and it also allows

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.400 
develop quite nicely and it also allows
moisture<00:07:35.970> levels<00:07:36.540> to<00:07:36.810> get<00:07:36.960> balanced

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.410 
moisture levels to get balanced

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.490 
moisture levels to get balanced
throughout<00:07:37.770> the<00:07:37.950> bin<00:07:38.180> so<00:07:39.180> by<00:07:39.300> the<00:07:39.390> time<00:07:39.660> one<00:07:40.440> of

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 
throughout the bin so by the time one of

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.159 
throughout the bin so by the time one of
the<00:07:40.590> two<00:07:40.740> weeks<00:07:40.950> are<00:07:41.220> up<00:07:41.479> the<00:07:42.479> system<00:07:42.870> is<00:07:43.020> going

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
the two weeks are up the system is going

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:47.510 
the two weeks are up the system is going
to<00:07:43.260> be<00:07:43.440> ideal<00:07:43.740> and<00:07:44.400> ready<00:07:44.970> for<00:07:45.090> your<00:07:45.630> worms<00:07:46.520> so

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
to be ideal and ready for your worms so

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.510 
to be ideal and ready for your worms so
of<00:07:47.580> course<00:07:47.790> last<00:07:48.120> but<00:07:48.330> not<00:07:48.450> least<00:07:48.979> we're<00:07:49.979> going

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 
of course last but not least we're going

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.880 
of course last but not least we're going
to<00:07:50.640> be<00:07:50.820> adding<00:07:51.030> our<00:07:51.780> composting<00:07:52.350> worms<00:07:52.560> and

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.890 
to be adding our composting worms and

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.600 
to be adding our composting worms and
these<00:07:53.700> are<00:07:53.970> typically<00:07:54.810> red<00:07:55.260> wigglers<00:07:55.710> I<00:07:55.950> see

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
these are typically red wigglers I see

these are typically red wigglers I see
Nia<00:07:56.790> foetida<00:07:57.210> is<00:07:57.390> the<00:07:57.990> lot<00:07:58.169> name<00:07:58.500> so<00:07:59.430> those<00:08:00.000> are

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270 
Nia foetida is the lot name so those are

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.670 
Nia foetida is the lot name so those are
the<00:08:00.330> ones<00:08:00.450> to<00:08:00.750> watch<00:08:00.780> out<00:08:01.140> for<00:08:01.380> there<00:08:01.560> are

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 
the ones to watch out for there are

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.650 
the ones to watch out for there are
other<00:08:01.890> varieties<00:08:02.460> but<00:08:02.640> these<00:08:02.850> are<00:08:03.180> the<00:08:03.510> most

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 
other varieties but these are the most

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.100 
other varieties but these are the most
versatile<00:08:04.260> and<00:08:04.590> the<00:08:05.160> most<00:08:05.310> widely<00:08:05.729> used<00:08:06.110> so

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.110 
versatile and the most widely used so

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.680 
versatile and the most widely used so
that's<00:08:07.290> pretty<00:08:07.530> much<00:08:07.620> eat<00:08:08.210> very<00:08:09.210> very<00:08:09.450> easy
