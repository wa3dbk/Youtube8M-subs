00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.080
 and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.460
 Well, guys, first of all, tell you that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 I have been able to solve the problem 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.540
 of not directly capture 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 I stop already taken by sack I say it by the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.390
 screen those blacks that gave me the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 principle that happened in the video of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.630
 sniper the mega low nor has 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.650
 reoccurred in this video more than 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.360
 nothing because it was the next one that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.040
 I recorded I went from sniper to game 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.989
 weapons and exactly the same thing happened to me 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.790
 in this - because in this one is only one 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.970
 low but hey it pisses me not fuck me 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.649
 you can not see the whole live because 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.140
 I know the little things to see it whole 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.540
 always fuck but well there I leave it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 you have simply lost a low moon 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.050
 the first with the b-23 will be more guys 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.050
 enjoy an epic comeback 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.490
 to this one of my mother of this month good is 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.690
 has been 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.969
 let's see this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 good with the last bullet and in the head 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.270
 of you 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.120
 oh my god haberes 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.210
 the execution of the least fear 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.580
 worth 3 for the solution is to take the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 You take a long time to come running 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.200
 this one is going to stick with another 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 so I'm going to leave them a bit now I'm going 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 to take advantage of my carrion menu that I am 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.850
 OK 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.850
 perfect 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.940
 and let's go with the boy this I do not like 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 I do not like anything, that's why I came to 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.450
 lightly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.750
 my mother stop going for that is the one that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.760
 go first 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.800
 for the moment I shit on the check said 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.350
 I'm going to record to see if you read and 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.630
 he surpassed that it's weird because he won 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.240
 by 100 points but how I overcome him 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.090
 I think it will be the time with more points than 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.210
 they were enemies and read and it surpassed him already 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.500
 exceed one I had I think well not 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.820
 90 o but this one had almost 110 not 120 me 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 I'm going to shut up because I'm getting clueless 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 and before this ruthless fuck neither 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.330
 that I took the nuclear here I change 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.880
 because you can not if we 're not going to see 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.080
 if we dismantled this man there was not 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.080

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.360

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.220
