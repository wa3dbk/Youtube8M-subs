00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello dear friends with you I yuri 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.850
 Axenov is a gameplay review pear 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.670
 drawn dragon foul 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.920
 This game is an addition to the game. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.380
 shadowrun returns which came out on 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 android probably about a year ago 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.570
 maybe maybe a little less and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.090
 the game is also a full-fledged n to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.609
 ports of action of this game 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 unfold in the city of Berlin I do not know 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.289
 is that berlin about which we are all 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 We think that are in Germany or 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.279
 some other 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 but in general it is not important the game is atmospheric 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.980
 A very interesting game is from 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.530
 myself 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.610
 rpb with tactical strategy elements 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.290
 from tactical strategy here are taken 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 step by step battles that are here 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.600
 I already played a little game but 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.059
 start the review I had to start the game with 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 the very beginning because it comes across 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559
 a very difficult battle that I still have 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 I can not pass and in order to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.539
 interact with objects is necessary 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.910
 just on them nah come and click and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.339
 so our main character is ours 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.979
 character which way by the way we 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.450
 can customize completely at startup 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 new games ie choose him 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.619
 appearance choose his class his 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.340
 abilities and also to pump skills 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 and accordingly it is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 the leader of our team who leads 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.670
 her respectively forward and we 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 what is there firstly I will immediately say 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.939
 the game is very interesting but the main disadvantage is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.729
 that there is no Russian language because 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.570
 probably 50 percent of the interestingness of this 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.880
 the game depends on the plot and the plot 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 There are many dialogues in English 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 many different here are text and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.750
 if you don't understand English well 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 and even more so to say slang 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 English is really yours 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.689
 have some minor problems with 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.719
 understanding of this plot, but despite 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.560
 even some language ones like that 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.420
 boundaries 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 playing the game is interesting because she 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.009
 really thought out and done very 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.379
 even qualitatively what can we do here 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.190
 we and the combat system turned on as I 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.410
 said fights turn-based 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 each of our units and I have them in 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.050
 the team is now four can perform 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.210
 two actions he either can far away 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.610
 go far, that is, like for example 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.610
 here we run out and pass and after that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 attack or go further still I 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.110
 I choose probably attack we forge 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.270
 we can different types of weapons we can 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.360
 open the melee can attack 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.630
 from a weapon or for example 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.240
 the character mage he can attack with his 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.970
 magic gun in general, choose the 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.190
 than at the moment is better to attack and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.910
 click on the opponent with double tap 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.040
 after that the enemy will be attacked 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.500
 further respectively 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.030
 action for our next players 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 naturally you can between them 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.800
 switch can not do everything 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.070
 actions that are required of you then 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.300
 there is for example i can be completely calm 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.820
 just skip your turn and complete 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.460
 his and in order to give way 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.010
 rival and finally defeat him 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.850
 but nonetheless I just give up so easily 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.520
 I do not want 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.610
 and let's try to still attack 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.130
 him when our moves are completed go 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.250
 rival as you see he changes too 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 its dislocation and this is not quite for us 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 probably 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.220
 plays on hand and here you need 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 consider here need to consider the landscape 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.620
 different items because behind them you 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.739
 you can hide and thereby lower 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.730
 the likelihood that you can get 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.870
 about hurt defeating all your 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.300
 opponents 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.750
 you go back to free mode 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.330
 games and you can walk freely 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.519
 in this video the very beginning of the game and so we 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.120
 got to the terminal ie we need 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.400
 connect to it and accordingly with 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120
 read some information here with us 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.440
 again options for action options 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.530
 dialogs which respectively and 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.870
 will affect the progress of your game on 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.919
 development of your company therefore everything 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.530
 it is desirable to have to read and otherwise would not 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.320
 you are probably very sweet on schedule 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.110
 the game is very cute you 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.190
 here I say nothing bad 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 I can probably optimize here too 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.160
 everything is smooth i.e. convenient control 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.500
 no lags I'm at least on shield 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.530
 tablet did not notice everything is going great 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.810
 and so we continue to play 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.730
 and now we are not out of combat mode 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.390
 due to the fact that here on us 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.750
 attacks 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.180
 still a gang of various enemy units with 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.610
 which we also now have to 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.360
 understand this spirit of us 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.670
 to play and win and then 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.290
 believe me it will be very hard to play 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.200
 there will be a mission where you need 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.420
 will wait 10 moves to 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.570
 the door opened and you could dump but 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.580
 there will be just a huge bunch of enemies 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.070
 and not here such small bipods 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.050
 really big bosses with whom 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.890
 just your strength probably won't be able to 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.710
 to cope 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.840
 but no less an interesting toy 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.390
 that some missions from the first 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.140
 it will be difficult enough to pass 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.420
 makes her probably even better 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.720
 because you still want to beat them 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.060
 and find out what will happen next how 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.520
 will continue to develop the plot to 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.950
 Sorry if you are not very good with 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.980
 English language plot you are not very 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.140
 well understand but nevertheless all the same 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.110
 the fun of the gameplay I 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.470
 I think you will be more than a toy 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.230
 popular in pcm deserves a lot 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.210
 awards and now i think she will get 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.300
 his second life and his second 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.450
 popularity on android respectively 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.530
 here is my opinion about the game shadow 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.930
 androgen 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.480
 I definitely recommend it to you as well 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.670
 play and get acquainted especially those who 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.670
 loves really cool projects they 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.670
 some kind of arcade runners and other slag
