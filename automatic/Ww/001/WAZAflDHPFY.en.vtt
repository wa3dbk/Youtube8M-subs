00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello everyone, I ’ll start the gameplay 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.130
 today's release from the game under 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.320
 called escape from dark moor crazy but 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.630
 This quest is very high quality 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280
 interesting and before review i'm into it so 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 stuck so far gone 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 but unfortunately I had my whole 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.740
 progress reset in order to take off 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.350
 Overview of the beginning so as not to blunt 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.039
 and know what to do and show you at all 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.460
 what is this game graphics here you see 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.700
 yourself are pretty good and pretty 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 here we have a panel where will 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.680
 collect all the items that we will 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 find and which will be useful to us in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 future to perform any 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 actions so picked up a newspaper but we 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.410
 I don’t know why she can be us 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.460
 need but for some reason all the same 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 will need so here we have a shield 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.340
 for some reason the screwdriver turns off 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.430
 picking up you can naturally 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.950
 promote this panel and we see what 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.689
 one fuse burned out and so here's 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.560
 we cut down and in order to 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.740
 turn on the light 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 we will need to find 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.020
 fuse it will be still oh how not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 I will soon tell you a secret so no more 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 there is nothing to catch here, only the door 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.619
 let's try to go out the door like that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.040
 we have door Vernadsky important quality 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.920
 important for the key and there is a key for us 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 you need to push it out to take the key and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.329
 open it from this side 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 let's try regret it is not 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.700
 receive but why because if we 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 him with kine there he will fall and we him 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 we can't get it so we need 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.350
 to lay a newspaper like this and now 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.259
 we can safely push out the key 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.469
 screwdriver now pick it up 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 and calmly with a clear conscience open 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.690
 door and exit this room 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.540
 Here is such a quest is very interesting 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.960
 there are a lot of locations waiting for you 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.420
 a lot of puzzles in general you do not miss 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.570
 will have everything very very interesting and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.970
 very good quality made the second game 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.850
 this is a strategy called battle 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 dragon's such strategies has become the latest 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.550
 even a lot and what we need here 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 do and here we play the role here 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 builders and master of the village of dragons 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.860
 we need to build different 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.670
 facilities here are two kinds of resources this 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.640
 sheep that dragons eat and gold 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.700
 on which we build various buildings and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.280
 we carry out various upgrades in general all 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.890
 according to the standard of such strategies now 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.989
 a whole bunch goes out therefore to go in cycles 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.380
 on this one let 's not 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.420
 train dragons so choose 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 dragons present moment we can 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.560
 train are just so's 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.120
 dragons and highs can do 10 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.299
 pieces let us work on a pearl 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.299
 all at once so that we do not wait for them here 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.100
 everyone is ready and now let's commit on 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.180
 an object on some nearby 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.890
 village choose history mode and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.940
 go to trouble I hope we are lucky 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.680
 and we can go through now to conquer all 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.780
 so where do we drop 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.720
 exactly in that place our 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.760
 dragons who attack 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.860
 the village of our rivals 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.709
 naturally need to destroy these 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.980
 dragons guards and after that all 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.900
 buildings after which we win and 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.840
 we get income which you drive right here 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.870
 will sign up how much money we have left 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.530
 after there and 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.290
 swept all my captured how much money 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.379
 you got it all right by 750 yellow 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.150
 750 sheep in general 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.970
 who loves his box and 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.269
 download this kind of games I think you 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.610
 sure to enjoy 3 arcade playing 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.769
 called and escape from hell 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.320
 that is, escape and backs that we need here 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.340
 do we need to dodge 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.600
 different monsters and collect stars 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.800
 who will be here the same idiot finger 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.169
 how many 5 footpaths are here on the left 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.750
 Our side of the screen that's the character 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.389
 shifted to the left tapaya right shifted 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.449
 right here own everything will be there 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.610
 there will be more opponents 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.710
 more and it will make everything harder and 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.870
 harder it is desirable to collect all 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.389
 stars and when you collect them 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.419
 some kind of support group come out 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.810
 cheerfully enough of him now 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.660
 so see here and so in general 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.120
 arcade to a nice cool made in 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.310
 pixel art which i love and 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.979
 probably many of you are also very strong 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.490
 loves the last grant hare cake 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.080
 Starvers v. Starcon and let's 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.130
 let's play this game 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.130
 choose a new one and tell you the graphics right away 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.349
 here is quite interesting and if 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.440
 honestly i was expecting a bit more from the game 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.630
 what's up here so control 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.910
 we have a cursor and that's where we put 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.490
 the cursor flies to that direction 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.710
 Here is our ball and we need this 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.349
 it is very inconvenient to manage it 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.690
 and hopefully the developers will do 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.599
 some more adequate control 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.280
 they are such a that we have now is 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.860
 there is a need to put the cursor in that 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.380
 Our side of this ball will fly off 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.479
 he has 5 lives you can not but 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.270
 In any case, carnivorous 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.460
 plant can not fall on thorns 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.440
 can not fall for any such here 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.590
 circular saws you need to fly 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.420
 collect stars and pass missions 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.940
 let's try now 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.940
 go here here's where we specify 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.320
 arrow and yes we passed the mission and see 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.560
 continuation of the comic 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.020
 In general, the schedule is quite interesting 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.140
 but management is enough 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.020
 probably disgusting in general swing 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.540
 or not to decide to decide with you yourself 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.550
 and I say goodbye to it all 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.280
 Thank you for your attention with you
