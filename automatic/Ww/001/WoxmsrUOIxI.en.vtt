stakeholder<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.200> only<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.680> dollar

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
stakeholder which was only one dollar

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
stakeholder which was only one dollar
and<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.640> technically<00:01:09.210> free<00:01:09.479> because

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and this is technically free because

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
and this is technically free because
it's<00:01:10.140> included<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> price<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's included with the price of the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.469 
it's included with the price of the
candle<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.790> put<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.100> glue<00:01:14.100> on

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
candle so put a little bit of glue on

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.609 
candle so put a little bit of glue on
actually<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.689> she<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
actually I think she put it on the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
actually I think she put it on the
candlestick<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:18.180> border<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:20.930> just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
candlestick on this border here and just

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
candlestick on this border here and just
glued<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.590> straight<00:01:23.100> onto<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.360> lid<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
glued it straight onto the lid and so

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.090 
glued it straight onto the lid and so
you<00:01:26.460> end<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.780> pretty

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
clean and smooth and it looks pretty

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.759

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
then I'm gonna go ahead and wipe the top

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.610 
then I'm gonna go ahead and wipe the top
part<00:03:52.130> also<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:52.970> alcohol<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:54.260> make<00:03:54.380> sure

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
part also with the alcohol to make sure

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.410 
part also with the alcohol to make sure
that<00:03:54.830> there<00:03:55.040> isn't<00:03:55.190> any<00:03:55.459> dust<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:56.060> here<00:03:58.420> and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
that there isn't any dust on here and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.580 
that there isn't any dust on here and
we're<00:03:59.959> all<00:04:00.110> set<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.690> let's<00:04:02.959> go<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.380> next

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
we're all set so let's go to the next

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.830 
we're all set so let's go to the next
step

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
so once you have removed the label then

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.930 
so once you have removed the label then
you're<00:04:09.200> ready<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:10.220> begin

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940
