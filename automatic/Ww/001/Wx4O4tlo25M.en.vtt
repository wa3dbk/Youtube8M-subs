00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
love and at the time I had decided that

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779 
love and at the time I had decided that
I<00:00:18.720> didn't<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.920> knife<00:00:20.340> all<00:00:20.609> that

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
well once I actually had it in my hand

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.300 
well once I actually had it in my hand
and<00:00:24.289> there<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> couple<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.680> reasons<00:00:25.890> for

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and there are a couple of reasons for

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.759

that<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.699> I'll<00:00:27.090> kind<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.769> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
that which I'll kind of get into but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.770

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
up to get a zero tolerance 560 you know

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.950 
up to get a zero tolerance 560 you know
I<00:01:09.689> found<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> online<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.720> good

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
price that you can get a 5 64 and I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.679 
price that you can get a 5 64 and I
jumped<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.740> here<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.689> have

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
jumped on it so here it is I have

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.910 
jumped on it so here it is I have
another<00:01:25.110> zero<00:01:25.590> tolerance<00:01:25.790> 560<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.590> video

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
another zero tolerance 560 so this video

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.760 
another zero tolerance 560 so this video
is<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.000> zero<00:01:30.630> tolerance<00:01:30.810> 560

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is going to be the zero tolerance 560

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
is going to be the zero tolerance 560
revisited<00:01:33.409> now<00:01:34.409> why<00:01:34.740> did<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.009> decide<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.610> get

be there were some little tweaks here

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.600 
be there were some little tweaks here
and<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.510> about<00:02:20.980> some<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.160> things<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
and there about some of the things that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.570 
and there about some of the things that
I<00:02:22.640> didn't<00:02:23.000> originally<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.830> some<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
I didn't originally like so some of the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.650 
I didn't originally like so some of the
changes<00:02:25.790> were<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.980> overall<00:02:28.370> texture<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.330> this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
changes were the overall texture of this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.280 
changes were the overall texture of this
g10<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.730> seems<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.120> much<00:02:32.840> less

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
g10 it seems like it's much less

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.950 
g10 it seems like it's much less
aggressive<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.790> particular<00:02:35.030> knife<00:02:35.660> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
aggressive on this particular knife and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.080 
aggressive on this particular knife and
that<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.830> really<00:02:36.980> bothering<00:02:37.220> me<00:02:37.520> originally

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that was really bothering me originally

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.290 
that was really bothering me originally
I<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.510> really<00:02:38.780> sharp<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.470> mean<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:39.920> these

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
I just was really sharp I mean all these

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.580 
I just was really sharp I mean all these
little<00:02:43.000> ridges<00:02:44.000> right<00:02:44.390> here<00:02:44.690> we're<00:02:45.440> just

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
little ridges right here we're just

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.780 
little ridges right here we're just
super<00:02:45.860> pointing<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:47.110> now<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.500> don't<00:02:49.490> know<00:02:49.730> if

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
super pointing and now I don't know if

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.750 
super pointing and now I don't know if
they<00:02:50.530> left<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> tumbler<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> little

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
they left this in the tumbler a little

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.330 
they left this in the tumbler a little
bit<00:02:52.880> longer<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.320> smoothed<00:02:54.650> out<00:02:54.950> but

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
bit longer and it's smoothed out but

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.430 
bit longer and it's smoothed out but
it's<00:02:55.580> really<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.450> different<00:02:57.080> texture

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's really it's a different texture

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.840 
it's really it's a different texture
it's<00:02:58.070> not<00:02:58.220> nearly<00:02:58.550> as<00:02:58.670> aggressive<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> that's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
it's not nearly as aggressive so that's

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.400 
it's not nearly as aggressive so that's
not<00:03:02.030> bothering<00:03:02.480> me<00:03:02.570> anymore<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.020> like<00:03:03.260> this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
not bothering me anymore I like this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.790 
not bothering me anymore I like this
texture<00:03:06.850> also<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:08.120> my<00:03:08.300> original<00:03:08.780> knife<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
texture also on my original knife the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.630 
texture also on my original knife the
detent<00:03:10.340> was<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:11.570> strong<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:13.250> know<00:03:13.340> even

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
detent was so strong that you know even

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.130 
detent was so strong that you know even
when<00:03:13.760> you're<00:03:13.880> holding<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.300> knife<00:03:14.570> correctly

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
when you're holding the knife correctly

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.260 
when you're holding the knife correctly
where<00:03:15.320> you're<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.560> touching<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.580> lock<00:03:16.760> bar<00:03:17.030> I

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
where you're not touching the lock bar I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.130 
where you're not touching the lock bar I
could<00:03:18.200> not<00:03:18.700> use<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.940> thumb<00:03:20.150> stud<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.690> open<00:03:21.020> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
could not use the thumb stud to open the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.010 
could not use the thumb stud to open the
knife<00:03:21.320> at<00:03:21.530> all<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:23.090> was<00:03:23.240> just<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.630> mean<00:03:23.690> you

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
knife at all it was just I mean you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.960 
knife at all it was just I mean you
would<00:03:24.170> press<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.709> press<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.190> until<00:03:25.850> your

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
would press and press and until your

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.199 
would press and press and until your
finger<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.020> know<00:03:27.140> about<00:03:27.560> blood<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:29.000> just

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
finger you know about blood and it just

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.300 
finger you know about blood and it just
would<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:29.510> open<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.110> now<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.040> version

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
would not open and now with this version

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.340 
would not open and now with this version
I<00:03:31.700> don't<00:03:32.300> know<00:03:32.390> if<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.750> do<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.110> camera

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
I don't know if I can do it on camera

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.160 
I don't know if I can do it on camera
it's<00:03:33.680> kind<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.860> weird<00:03:34.070> angle<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.810> flips

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
it's kind of weird angle but it flips

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.190 
it's kind of weird angle but it flips
right<00:03:36.320> out<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.740> problem<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.420> detent<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:38.990> not

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
right out I problem so the detent is not

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.610 
right out I problem so the detent is not
nearly<00:03:39.530> as<00:03:39.680> strong<00:03:40.430> on<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.240> particular

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
nearly as strong on this particular

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.780 
nearly as strong on this particular
version<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:42.980> knife<00:03:44.739> also<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:46.250> lock<00:03:46.520> bar

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
version this knife also this lock bar

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.590 
version this knife also this lock bar
just<00:03:47.420> doesn't<00:03:47.810> feel<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.020> sharp<00:03:48.500> these<00:03:49.600> ridges

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
just doesn't feel a sharp these ridges

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.810 
just doesn't feel a sharp these ridges
right<00:03:50.780> here<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.170> jumping<00:03:52.100> on<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.370> lock<00:03:52.580> bar

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
right here that jumping on the lock bar

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.180 
right here that jumping on the lock bar
not<00:03:53.690> as<00:03:53.870> sharp<00:03:54.050> it<00:03:54.290> doesn't<00:03:54.890> tear<00:03:55.070> up<00:03:55.160> my

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
not as sharp it doesn't tear up my

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.610 
not as sharp it doesn't tear up my
fingers<00:03:55.610> as<00:03:55.820> much<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.959> also<00:03:57.110> might<00:03:57.440> be

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
fingers as much that also might be

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.040 
fingers as much that also might be
because<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.160> lock<00:03:58.370> bar<00:03:58.580> itself<00:03:58.940> seems<00:03:59.930> a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
because the lock bar itself seems a

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.040 
because the lock bar itself seems a
little<00:04:00.170> bit<00:04:00.320> less<00:04:00.560> stiff<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:02.480> then<00:04:02.540> finally

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
little bit less stiff and then finally

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.660 
little bit less stiff and then finally
the<00:04:03.230> other<00:04:03.260> area<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.010> was<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> little<00:04:04.459> bit

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the other area that was a little bit

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.600 
the other area that was a little bit
sharp<00:04:05.000> was<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.440> back<00:04:06.709> section<00:04:07.010> here<00:04:08.170> these

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
sharp was this back section here these

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.570 
sharp was this back section here these
serrations<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:11.300> these<00:04:11.750> grooves<00:04:12.110> on<00:04:13.070> my

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
serrations this these grooves on my

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.390 
serrations this these grooves on my
original<00:04:14.060> knife<00:04:14.350> these<00:04:15.350> were<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.680> sharp<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:16.130> had

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
original knife these were so sharp I had

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.580 
original knife these were so sharp I had
kind<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:16.940> considered<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.600> know<00:04:17.720> trying<00:04:18.530> to

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
kind of considered you know trying to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.800 
kind of considered you know trying to
cut<00:04:18.859> with<00:04:19.070> these<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.700> see<00:04:20.270> how<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.419> worked

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
cut with these and see how that worked

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.409 
cut with these and see how that worked
they<00:04:21.140> were<00:04:21.290> so<00:04:21.440> sharp<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:22.490> now<00:04:22.669> they're<00:04:23.210> just

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
they were so sharp but now they're just

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.510 
they were so sharp but now they're just
a<00:04:23.510> little<00:04:23.750> bit<00:04:23.870> more<00:04:24.020> rounded<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:25.400> they're

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
a little bit more rounded and they're

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.340 
a little bit more rounded and they're
still<00:04:25.729> pretty<00:04:25.880> aggressive

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
still pretty aggressive

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.250 
still pretty aggressive
but<00:04:28.100> not<00:04:28.340> nearly<00:04:28.640> as<00:04:28.760> much<00:04:29.000> as<00:04:29.210> they<00:04:29.390> were<00:04:30.140> all

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
but not nearly as much as they were all

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.620 
but not nearly as much as they were all
my<00:04:30.410> first<00:04:30.710> knife<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.360> think<00:04:32.570> that

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
my first knife so I just think that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.590 
my first knife so I just think that
maybe<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.620> over<00:04:33.980> time<00:04:34.220> as<00:04:34.520> they<00:04:35.270> kind<00:04:35.510> of

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
maybe you know over time as they kind of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.720 
maybe you know over time as they kind of
you<00:04:36.020> know<00:04:36.050> make<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> couple<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.830> batches<00:04:36.980> of

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
you know make a couple of batches of

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.720 
you know make a couple of batches of
these<00:04:38.180> knives<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:39.220> kind<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.250> think<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.610> they

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
these knives I kind of think that they

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.940 
these knives I kind of think that they
just<00:04:40.940> took<00:04:41.180> some<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.480> the<00:04:41.570> feedback<00:04:41.750> maybe<00:04:42.230> I

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
just took some of the feedback maybe I

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.730

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
561 but the 561 was always the version

curious<00:05:46.330> there's<00:05:47.330> nothing<00:05:47.810> at<00:05:47.960> all<00:05:48.670> different

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
curious there's nothing at all different

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.540 
curious there's nothing at all different
between<00:05:50.180> these<00:05:50.450> two<00:05:50.690> versions<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.340> 560<00:05:52.340> and

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
between these two versions the 560 and

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.730 
between these two versions the 560 and
the<00:05:52.610> 561<00:05:53.320> aside<00:05:54.320> from<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.860> g10<00:05:55.780> color<00:05:56.780> on<00:05:57.140> this

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
the 561 aside from the g10 color on this

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:07.180 
the 561 aside from the g10 color on this
side<00:06:03.250> now<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.310> 561<00:06:05.180> does<00:06:06.110> have<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.860> little<00:06:07.040> bit

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
side now the 561 does have a little bit

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.920 
side now the 561 does have a little bit
different<00:06:07.580> action<00:06:07.940> actually<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:08.510> lock<00:06:08.660> bars

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
different action actually the lock bars

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.160 
different action actually the lock bars
even<00:06:09.260> a<00:06:09.500> little<00:06:09.620> bit<00:06:09.940> easier<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.420> disengage<00:06:11.960> on

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
even a little bit easier to disengage on

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.320 
even a little bit easier to disengage on
this<00:06:12.320> one<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:13.810> it's<00:06:14.810> just<00:06:15.050> super<00:06:15.440> smooth<00:06:15.680> I

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
this one and it's just super smooth I

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.800 
this one and it's just super smooth I
mean<00:06:17.330> no<00:06:18.170> problem<00:06:18.620> and<00:06:19.070> if<00:06:19.790> you<00:06:19.940> disengage<00:06:20.420> it

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
mean no problem and if you disengage it

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.470 
mean no problem and if you disengage it
I<00:06:20.990> mean<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.650> just<00:06:21.850> slides<00:06:22.850> right<00:06:23.030> back<00:06:23.300> into

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
I mean it just slides right back into

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.210 
I mean it just slides right back into
the<00:06:23.630> handle<00:06:23.960> I<00:06:24.140> mean<00:06:24.560> it's<00:06:24.680> just<00:06:24.740> totally

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
the handle I mean it's just totally

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.380 
the handle I mean it's just totally
different<00:06:25.550> than<00:06:25.670> the<00:06:25.760> first<00:06:25.940> knife<00:06:26.150> that<00:06:26.330> I

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
different than the first knife that I

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.490 
different than the first knife that I
had<00:06:26.660> and<00:06:27.080> I<00:06:27.890> I<00:06:28.220> don't<00:06:28.760> know<00:06:28.880> you<00:06:29.870> know<00:06:29.900> how<00:06:30.320> many

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
had and I I don't know you know how many

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.570 
had and I I don't know you know how many
changes<00:06:30.920> they<00:06:31.100> made<00:06:32.380> but<00:06:33.380> I'm<00:06:34.010> really<00:06:34.370> digging

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
changes they made but I'm really digging

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.270 
changes they made but I'm really digging
these<00:06:35.210> two<00:06:35.510> knives<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:36.050> I'm<00:06:37.040> kind<00:06:37.250> of

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
these two knives and I'm kind of

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.460 
these two knives and I'm kind of
thinking<00:06:37.370> about<00:06:37.610> keeping<00:06:37.790> both<00:06:38.120> of<00:06:38.360> them<00:06:38.510> you

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
thinking about keeping both of them you

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.839 
thinking about keeping both of them you
know<00:06:39.590> it's<00:06:39.890> a

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
know it's a

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.449 
know it's a
I<00:06:40.939> like<00:06:41.929> them<00:06:42.110> both<00:06:42.139> they're<00:06:42.679> both<00:06:42.830> very<00:06:43.189> nice

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:43.459 
I like them both they're both very nice

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.519 
I like them both they're both very nice
looking<00:06:43.639> I<00:06:43.999> like<00:06:44.389> both<00:06:44.629> of<00:06:44.659> the<00:06:45.050> colors<00:06:45.499> the

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 
looking I like both of the colors the

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.499 
looking I like both of the colors the
black<00:06:45.889> and<00:06:46.189> the<00:06:46.369> brown<00:06:47.179> and<00:06:47.740> I<00:06:49.149> don't<00:06:50.149> see<00:06:50.330> that

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
black and the brown and I don't see that

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.040 
black and the brown and I don't see that
being<00:06:50.569> any<00:06:50.899> different<00:06:50.990> than<00:06:51.499> having<00:06:51.819> various

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
being any different than having various

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.019 
being any different than having various
sprint<00:06:54.050> runs<00:06:54.259> of<00:06:54.529> like<00:06:54.709> a<00:06:54.740> paramilitary<00:06:55.309> 2<00:06:55.789> or

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
sprint runs of like a paramilitary 2 or

something I mean you know people do that

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.510 
something I mean you know people do that
I<00:06:59.149> don't<00:06:59.779> think<00:06:59.839> it's<00:07:00.050> really<00:07:00.229> that<00:07:00.259> crazy<00:07:00.649> but

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
I don't think it's really that crazy but

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.399 
I don't think it's really that crazy but
anyway<00:07:02.270> I<00:07:02.300> just<00:07:02.389> thought<00:07:02.599> i'd<00:07:02.779> give<00:07:03.289> you<00:07:03.319> a

great knife and I still feel that way
here's<00:07:13.849> my<00:07:14.029> zero<00:07:14.360> tolerance<00:07:14.599> knives<00:07:15.050> and<00:07:15.469> my

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:15.619 
here's my zero tolerance knives and my

here's my zero tolerance knives and my
crucial<00:07:16.399> tilt<00:07:17.709> can't<00:07:18.709> say<00:07:18.889> enough<00:07:19.039> good

things<00:07:19.279> about<00:07:19.580> the<00:07:20.059> kvt<00:07:20.779> system<00:07:21.229> I<00:07:21.289> think<00:07:21.439> it's

00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:21.559 
things about the kvt system I think it's

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:26.019 
things about the kvt system I think it's
really<00:07:21.649> cool<00:07:21.949> and<00:07:22.689> I<00:07:23.689> think<00:07:24.080> the<00:07:24.379> 560<00:07:25.039> was<00:07:25.699> a
