00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
all right as you can see I've got all of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
and it's not perfect by any means I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.430

so<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> decided<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.340> just<00:04:33.060> cut<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:34.139> strips<00:04:34.590> of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
so I decided to just cut the strips of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.030 
so I decided to just cut the strips of
all<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.120> colors<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.750> was<00:04:37.050> going<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.500> use<00:04:37.710> and

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
all the colors I was going to use and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.659 
all the colors I was going to use and
then<00:04:38.729> do<00:04:39.240> each<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.320> one<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.680> them<00:04:40.919> with<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
then do each and one of them with the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.540 
then do each and one of them with the
twisting<00:04:42.270> because<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.259> much<00:04:43.470> easier<00:04:44.070> for<00:04:44.130> me

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
twisting because it's much easier for me

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.960 
twisting because it's much easier for me
this<00:04:44.820> way<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.509> I<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.949> my<00:04:47.130> husband's<00:04:47.669> help

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.090 
this way and I can get my husband's help

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
and not do them every single time when

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.670 
and not do them every single time when
I'm<00:04:50.220> done<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.449> what<00:04:51.810> Henry<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.500> are
