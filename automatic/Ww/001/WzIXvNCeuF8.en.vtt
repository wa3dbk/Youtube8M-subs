00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189 
hello everybody this is part two of a

hello everybody this is part two of a
two-part<00:00:06.399> video<00:00:06.910> review<00:00:07.510> of<00:00:07.540> the<00:00:07.779> boost<00:00:08.349> force

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
two-part video review of the boost force

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.390 
two-part video review of the boost force
from<00:00:09.309> boost<00:00:09.700> mobile<00:00:10.709> alright<00:00:11.709> so<00:00:11.950> this<00:00:12.160> again

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
from boost mobile alright so this again

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.249 
from boost mobile alright so this again
is<00:00:12.549> continued<00:00:13.209> from<00:00:13.360> part<00:00:13.660> 1<00:00:13.839> so<00:00:14.110> if<00:00:14.169> you

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
is continued from part 1 so if you

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.659 
is continued from part 1 so if you
haven't<00:00:14.559> already<00:00:14.589> watched<00:00:14.919> part<00:00:15.249> 1<00:00:15.429> you

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:15.669 
haven't already watched part 1 you

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.110 
haven't already watched part 1 you
should<00:00:15.849> probably<00:00:16.030> go<00:00:16.450> watch<00:00:16.660> that<00:00:16.990> first<00:00:18.120> I'm

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
should probably go watch that first I'm

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.210 
should probably go watch that first I'm
going<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.570> continue<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.260> review<00:00:20.560> with<00:00:20.770> speed

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
going to continue the review with speed

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.580 
going to continue the review with speed
tests<00:00:21.760> except<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.360> can't<00:00:22.420> actually<00:00:22.930> perform

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
tests except I can't actually perform

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.420 
tests except I can't actually perform
speed<00:00:23.950> tests<00:00:24.310> for<00:00:24.490> you<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:25.950> if<00:00:26.950> you<00:00:27.130> did

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
speed tests for you because if you did

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.760 
speed tests for you because if you did
watch<00:00:27.640> part<00:00:28.030> one<00:00:28.300> you'd<00:00:28.600> know<00:00:28.810> that<00:00:28.840> boost

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
watch part one you'd know that boost

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.560 
watch part one you'd know that boost
mobile<00:00:30.160> decided<00:00:30.670> not<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.940> activate<00:00:31.390> this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
mobile decided not to activate this

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.080 
mobile decided not to activate this
phone<00:00:31.840> for<00:00:31.900> me<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:33.489> they<00:00:33.670> think<00:00:33.700> that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
phone for me because they think that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.229 
phone for me because they think that
even<00:00:34.839> though<00:00:34.929> it's<00:00:35.050> brand<00:00:35.379> new<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.910> think

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
even though it's brand new they think

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.209 
even though it's brand new they think
that<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.719> is<00:00:37.749> activated<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.559> another<00:00:38.829> account

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
that it is activated to another account

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.509 
that it is activated to another account
which<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.329> not<00:00:40.539> so<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.679> was<00:00:41.980> unable<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
which it is not so I was unable to

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.489 
which it is not so I was unable to
activate<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:43.030> they<00:00:43.300> didn't<00:00:43.780> do<00:00:43.899> anything<00:00:44.140> for

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
activate it they didn't do anything for

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.139 
activate it they didn't do anything for
me<00:00:44.679> i'll<00:00:44.829> just<00:00:45.039> have<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.249> return<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.760> when<00:00:45.940> i<00:00:45.969> am

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
me i'll just have to return it when i am

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.639 
me i'll just have to return it when i am
done<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:47.379> here<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.429> the<00:00:48.999> speed<00:00:49.539> test<00:00:49.780> situation

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
done so here is the speed test situation

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.759 
done so here is the speed test situation
i<00:00:50.829> cannot<00:00:51.280> perform<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.870> i<00:00:53.109> will<00:00:53.319> tell<00:00:53.559> you

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
i cannot perform but i will tell you

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.540 
i cannot perform but i will tell you
that<00:00:54.479> LTE<00:00:55.479> is<00:00:55.600> fast<00:00:55.989> on<00:00:56.409> sprint<00:00:56.769> i've<00:00:56.979> used<00:00:57.309> it

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
that LTE is fast on sprint i've used it

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.860 
that LTE is fast on sprint i've used it
and<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.059> can<00:00:58.210> watch<00:00:58.359> some<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.659> my<00:00:58.780> other

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
and you can watch some of my other

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.270 
and you can watch some of my other
videos<00:00:59.109> to<00:00:59.440> see<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.789> see<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.269> LTE<00:01:01.929> speeds<00:01:02.499> they

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
videos to see to see the LTE speeds they

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.829 
videos to see to see the LTE speeds they
all<00:01:03.550> seem<00:01:03.819> to<00:01:03.940> be<00:01:04.059> about<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.420> same<00:01:04.600> on

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
all seem to be about the same on

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.870 
all seem to be about the same on
different<00:01:05.170> phones<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.620> i've<00:01:05.680> tested<00:01:05.950> cross

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
different phones that i've tested cross

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.550 
different phones that i've tested cross
boost<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.509> sprint<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.350> virgin<00:01:08.829> mobile<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:10.560> LT

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
boost and sprint and virgin mobile so LT

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.520 
boost and sprint and virgin mobile so LT
is<00:01:11.590> fast<00:01:12.070> around<00:01:12.399> 10<00:01:12.610> megabits<00:01:13.060> per<00:01:13.119> second<00:01:13.659> 3g

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
is fast around 10 megabits per second 3g

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.100 
is fast around 10 megabits per second 3g
seems<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:15.009> be<00:01:15.130> faster<00:01:15.369> on<00:01:15.610> lte-enabled<00:01:16.509> phones

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
seems to be faster on lte-enabled phones

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
seems to be faster on lte-enabled phones
as<00:01:17.409> well<00:01:17.439> because<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.780> supports<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.560> different

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
as well because it supports a different

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.389 
as well because it supports a different
add-on<00:01:22.689> thing<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.409> if<00:01:23.770> you're<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.070> an<00:01:24.159> area

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
add-on thing that if you're in an area

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.550 
add-on thing that if you're in an area
the<00:01:24.939> network<00:01:25.270> supports<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.079> blah<00:01:26.320> blah

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
the network supports it in blah blah

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.249 
the network supports it in blah blah
blah<00:01:26.590> anyways<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:28.420> typically<00:01:28.810> can<00:01:29.110> be

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
blah anyways they typically can be

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.990 
blah anyways they typically can be
faster<00:01:29.770> 3g<00:01:30.670> speeds<00:01:31.149> as<00:01:31.329> well<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:33.969> a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
faster 3g speeds as well so that is a

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.209 
faster 3g speeds as well so that is a
speed<00:01:34.390> test<00:01:34.630> situation<00:01:35.259> sadly<00:01:35.859> I<00:01:35.890> cannot

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
speed test situation sadly I cannot

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.160 
speed test situation sadly I cannot
perform<00:01:36.460> speed<00:01:36.939> tests<00:01:37.299> i<00:01:37.390> love<00:01:37.630> doing<00:01:37.780> speed

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
perform speed tests i love doing speed

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.429 
perform speed tests i love doing speed
tests<00:01:38.619> but<00:01:39.369> i<00:01:39.579> can<00:01:40.240> do<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> quadrant<00:01:41.229> standard

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
tests but i can do a quadrant standard

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.240 
tests but i can do a quadrant standard
test<00:01:42.159> for<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.469> let<00:01:44.469> me<00:01:44.619> run<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.070> full

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
test for you and let me run the full

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.539 
test for you and let me run the full
benchmark<00:01:45.850> here<00:01:48.000> alright<00:01:50.070> again<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.310> also

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
benchmark here alright again I also

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.910 
benchmark here alright again I also
could<00:01:51.939> not<00:01:51.969> test<00:01:52.479> call<00:01:52.780> quality<00:01:53.079> on<00:01:53.380> both<00:01:53.590> ends

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
could not test call quality on both ends

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.789 
could not test call quality on both ends
but<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.880> call<00:01:55.119> 611<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.170> phone<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:56.770> I

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
but I can call 611 with this phone so I

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.630 
but I can call 611 with this phone so I
did<00:01:57.100> do<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.469> voice<00:02:00.009> on<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.520> other

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
did do that and the voice on the other

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.870 
did do that and the voice on the other
end<00:02:00.820> was<00:02:01.270> not<00:02:01.479> very<00:02:01.719> clear<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.700> was

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
end was not very clear and but it was

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.020 
end was not very clear and but it was
loud<00:02:04.390> enough<00:02:05.009> again<00:02:06.009> though<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.369> voice<00:02:06.520> not

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
loud enough again though the voice not

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.880 
loud enough again though the voice not
clear<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.869> was<00:02:08.080> kind<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.560> blurry<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.890> lower

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
clear it was kind of blurry and lower

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.880 
clear it was kind of blurry and lower
tone<00:02:12.280> stood<00:02:12.790> out<00:02:12.970> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
tone stood out and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
tone stood out and
in<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.490> bad<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.730> kind<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.390> way<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.810> drowned<00:02:16.170> out

in a bad way kind of way and drowned out

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.930 
in a bad way kind of way and drowned out
the<00:02:16.410> higher<00:02:16.800> tone<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the higher tone so it was not very

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.660 
the higher tone so it was not very
crisper<00:02:18.480> clear<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> audio

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
crisper clear so that is the audio

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.090 
crisper clear so that is the audio

quality again that was the 611 system
for<00:02:23.310> boostmobile<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.180> who<00:02:24.930> knows<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
for boostmobile so who knows if that's a

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.720 
for boostmobile so who knows if that's a
good<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.459> good<00:02:27.000> source<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:28.140> not<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.950> again

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
good a good source or not but again

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.490 
good a good source or not but again
couldn't<00:02:30.090> really<00:02:30.240> test<00:02:30.540> call<00:02:30.780> quality<00:02:31.080> with

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
couldn't really test call quality with

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.820 
couldn't really test call quality with
the<00:02:32.330> lack<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.950> activation<00:02:36.470> will<00:02:37.470> let<00:02:37.620> this

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
the lack of activation will let this

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.750 
the lack of activation will let this
thing<00:02:38.420> continue<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.750> here<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:41.340> next<00:02:41.550> I'm

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
thing continue out here but next I'm

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
thing continue out here but next I'm
going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> dump<00:02:42.209> actually<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.020> go<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350

was<00:02:43.440> really<00:02:43.800> fast<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.660> completing<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.780> test

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
was really fast for completing that test

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.920 
was really fast for completing that test
and<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:48.000> device<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.690> there

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and as you can see your device is there

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and as you can see your device is there
at<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.170> top<00:02:49.380> with<00:02:50.209> 5122<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.660> did<00:02:52.410> perform<00:02:52.769> this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
at the top with 5122 I did perform this

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.770 
at the top with 5122 I did perform this
test<00:02:53.220> once<00:02:53.489> before<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.970> did<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.300> for<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.480> video

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
test once before I did it for the video

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.290 
test once before I did it for the video
and<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.650> got<00:02:56.310> five<00:02:56.550> thousand<00:02:57.030> three<00:02:57.269> hundred

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
and I got five thousand three hundred

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.110 
and I got five thousand three hundred
and<00:02:57.630> something<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:59.670> guess<00:03:00.540> low<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> mid<00:03:02.120> five

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and something so I guess low to mid five

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.770 
and something so I guess low to mid five
thousand<00:03:03.720> range<00:03:04.310> puts<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.430> above<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.700> 1x<00:03:06.239> but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
thousand range puts it above the 1x but

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.110 
thousand range puts it above the 1x but
it<00:03:06.989> does<00:03:07.140> not<00:03:07.290> oh<00:03:07.670> here<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it does not oh here you can see the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.040 
it does not oh here you can see the
individual<00:03:09.690> scores<00:03:10.080> down<00:03:10.350> there<00:03:10.620> again<00:03:11.580> now

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050

for a change and I am going to do a
quick<00:04:02.160> demo<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.610> this<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.090> when<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.660> was

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
quick demo of this but when I was

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.060 
quick demo of this but when I was
playing<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.320> earlier<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.370> say<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:07.070> there

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
playing it earlier I have to say I there

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.819 
playing it earlier I have to say I there
was<00:04:08.190> zero<00:04:08.610> lag<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.209> everything<00:04:09.690> was

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
was zero lag and everything was

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.310 
was zero lag and everything was
extremely<00:04:10.829> smooth<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.489> graphics<00:04:12.030> were<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.780> I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
extremely smooth the graphics were and I

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.430 
extremely smooth the graphics were and I
was<00:04:13.620> very<00:04:13.650> impressed<00:04:14.220> with<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.420> i<00:04:15.780> will<00:04:16.169> say

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
was very impressed with it so i will say

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.529 
was very impressed with it so i will say
that<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:17.010> i<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.519> most<00:04:17.789> games<00:04:18.150> should<00:04:18.390> be

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
that and i think most games should be

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.670 
that and i think most games should be

let's<00:04:27.700> turn<00:04:27.970> on<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.150> noise<00:04:28.389> a<00:04:28.570> little<00:04:28.810> oops

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
let's turn on the noise a little oops

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.680 
let's turn on the noise a little oops
there<00:04:29.560> we<00:04:29.590> go<00:04:29.770> i<00:04:29.830> ran<00:04:30.100> into<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.430> wall<00:04:30.580> let's<00:04:31.570> do

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
there we go i ran into a wall let's do

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.180 
there we go i ran into a wall let's do
it<00:04:31.720> one<00:04:31.930> more<00:04:31.990> time<00:04:32.139> here<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.650> can<00:04:32.800> see<00:04:33.040> how

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
it one more time here you can see how

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.010 
it one more time here you can see how
smooth<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:34.090> i'm<00:04:34.330> not<00:04:34.389> sure<00:04:34.720> if<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.900> can

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
smooth this is i'm not sure if you can

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:45.870 
smooth this is i'm not sure if you can
really<00:04:35.230> tell<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> camera<00:04:36.160> but

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.480 

there<00:04:46.880> we<00:04:47.180> go<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.780> my<00:04:47.930> death<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.740> there<00:04:49.250> we<00:04:49.370> go

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
there we go to my death and there we go

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.010 
there we go to my death and there we go
you<00:04:49.550> can<00:04:49.760> see<00:04:49.940> very<00:04:50.180> fast<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.750> smooth<00:04:50.990> so

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
you can see very fast and smooth so

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.140 
you can see very fast and smooth so
again<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.890> think<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.310> main<00:04:52.610> thing<00:04:52.640> with<00:04:53.000> this

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
again I think the main thing with this

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.320 
again I think the main thing with this
phone<00:04:53.420> is<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.810> processor<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:54.470> so<00:04:54.830> good<00:04:55.100> that

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
phone is the processor is so good that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.990 
phone is the processor is so good that
you<00:04:56.330> shouldn't<00:04:56.600> have<00:04:56.750> problems<00:04:57.260> there

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
you shouldn't have problems there

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.370 
you shouldn't have problems there
alright<00:04:59.000> well<00:04:59.240> that's<00:04:59.480> about<00:04:59.630> all<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.930> can<00:05:00.050> give

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
alright well that's about all I can give

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.920 
alright well that's about all I can give
you<00:05:00.530> without<00:05:00.890> na<00:05:01.250> without<00:05:02.030> having<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.450> cellular

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
you without na without having a cellular

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.310 
you without na without having a cellular
connection<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:04.760> conclusion<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.960> phone

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
connection so in conclusion this phone

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.380 
connection so in conclusion this phone
even<00:05:07.250> though<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.370> didn't<00:05:07.640> get<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.790> fully<00:05:08.120> test

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
even though I didn't get to fully test

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.960 
even though I didn't get to fully test
it<00:05:08.660> with<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.290> network<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.100> everything<00:05:10.520> it

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
it with the network and everything it

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.130 
it with the network and everything it
performed<00:05:11.420> very<00:05:11.660> well<00:05:11.750> for<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
performed very well for a

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.440 
performed very well for a
two-hundred-dollar<00:05:12.800> phone<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:14.210> have<00:05:14.330> to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
two-hundred-dollar phone you have to

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.510 
two-hundred-dollar phone you have to
realize<00:05:14.600> two<00:05:15.110> hundred<00:05:15.440> dollars<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.100> this<00:05:16.340> has

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
realize two hundred dollars and this has

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.840 
realize two hundred dollars and this has
a<00:05:16.550> 1.5<00:05:17.150> gigahertz<00:05:17.570> dual-core<00:05:18.140> processor<00:05:19.130> so

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor so

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.120 
a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor so
really<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.690> shouldn't<00:05:20.990> be<00:05:21.170> bad<00:05:21.410> when<00:05:21.860> you're

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
really you shouldn't be bad when you're

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.200 
really you shouldn't be bad when you're
playing<00:05:22.700> games<00:05:23.300> loading<00:05:24.290> normal<00:05:24.710> apps<00:05:25.210> the

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
playing games loading normal apps the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.910 
playing games loading normal apps the
only<00:05:26.420> downside<00:05:26.660> really<00:05:27.290> was<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.620> camera

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
only downside really was the camera

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.060 
only downside really was the camera
which<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.610> don't<00:05:28.820> like<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:30.050> one<00:05:30.290> also<00:05:30.440> has<00:05:30.590> LTE

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
which I don't like this one also has LTE

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.790 
which I don't like this one also has LTE
so<00:05:31.520> it'll<00:05:31.670> get<00:05:31.820> great<00:05:32.120> network<00:05:32.510> speeds<00:05:32.870> on<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
so it'll get great network speeds on the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.180 
so it'll get great network speeds on the
next<00:05:34.130> year<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:34.880> years<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.180> come<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.540> sprint

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
next year and years to come a sprint

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.060 
next year and years to come a sprint
expands<00:05:37.190> their<00:05:37.340> LTE<00:05:37.580> network<00:05:38.440> well<00:05:39.440> thank<00:05:40.010> you
