00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that makes a lot easier because then you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.010 
that makes a lot easier because then you
can<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.119> grab<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> bar<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.810> comes

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for the eye is to just practice making

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.929 
for the eye is to just practice making
the<00:01:20.970> smooth<00:01:21.180> motion<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> circle<00:01:22.200> oh

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.880 

yeah<00:01:26.939> don't<00:01:27.479> try<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> force<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
yeah don't try to force it if you really

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.100 
yeah don't try to force it if you really
like<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> spin<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> faster<00:01:30.810> than<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
like if you spin it faster than it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
like if you spin it faster than it's
that<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> wants<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.460> gonna<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.000> mess

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that it wants to go it's gonna like mess

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.580 
that it wants to go it's gonna like mess
up<00:01:35.329> just<00:01:36.329> practice<00:01:36.930> standing<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> ground

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
up just practice standing on the ground

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
up just practice standing on the ground
do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> shitload<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.460> every<00:01:38.820> day<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
do a shitload of these every day you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:53.539 
do a shitload of these every day you
know<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.790> do<00:01:41.790> this

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.310 

well<00:01:54.549> once<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.510> get<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> rotation<00:01:56.170> down

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
well once you get the rotation down

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.539 
well once you get the rotation down
you're<00:01:56.590> landing<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.040> then<00:01:57.130> just<00:01:57.280> work<00:01:57.430> on

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
you're landing and then just work on

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.280 
you're landing and then just work on
catching<00:01:57.909> them<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.420> then<00:01:58.659> doing<00:01:58.810> over<00:01:59.049> like

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
catching them and then doing over like

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.020 
catching them and then doing over like
just<00:01:59.470> about<00:01:59.560> anything<00:01:59.830> that's<00:02:00.009> easier<00:02:00.369> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
just about anything that's easier like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.390 
just about anything that's easier like
spine<00:02:01.390> them<00:02:01.630> boxes<00:02:02.080> pyramids<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:03.130> could<00:02:03.280> do<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
spine them boxes pyramids you could do a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.320 
spine them boxes pyramids you could do a
front-flip

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
front-flip

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.960 
front-flip
