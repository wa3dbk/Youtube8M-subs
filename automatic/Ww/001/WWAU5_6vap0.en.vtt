of super fabric on this glove

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.509 
of super fabric on this glove
we<00:02:30.599> saw<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> SGS<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.530> has<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.829> ceramic<00:02:32.280> super

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
we saw the SGS it has the ceramic super

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.399 
we saw the SGS it has the ceramic super
fabric<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> resin<00:02:33.750> super<00:02:34.049> fabric

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
fabric this is the resin super fabric

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.600 
fabric this is the resin super fabric
which<00:02:34.530> allows<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.069> go<00:02:35.159> with<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.549> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the bumps versus more of the plates it's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.259 
the bumps versus more of the plates it's
actually<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.489> next<00:02:38.730> level<00:02:39.000> up

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
actually going to be that next level up

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.610 
actually going to be that next level up
super<00:02:39.569> fabric<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.110> bit<00:02:40.290> more<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> an

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
super fabric it's a bit more of an

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.350 
super fabric it's a bit more of an
investment<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.340> allows<00:02:41.549> them<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.819> space<00:02:42.150> it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
investment it allows them to space it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.460 
investment it allows them to space it
out<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.569> little<00:02:42.780> further<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.260> they're<00:02:43.379> more

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
out a little further so they're more

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.319 
out a little further so they're more
breathable<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.519> perform

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
breathable but they actually perform

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.000 
breathable but they actually perform
better<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.930> crash<00:02:46.200> scenario<00:02:46.379> so<00:02:46.920> you're

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
better in a crash scenario so you're

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.349 
better in a crash scenario so you're
gonna<00:02:47.099> see<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.430> they're<00:02:47.579> all<00:02:47.730> foam<00:02:48.120> back

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
gonna see that they're all foam back

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.970 
gonna see that they're all foam back
from<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.720> shock<00:02:48.959> absorbing<00:02:49.470> side<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.829> things

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.289 
from a shock absorbing side of things
you're<00:02:50.340> getting<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.640> dual<00:02:50.910> level<00:02:51.239> of

this very rare stingray material is

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.980 
this very rare stingray material is
extremely<00:05:19.310> expensive<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.270> it's<00:05:20.630> going<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.870> be

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
extremely expensive and it's going to be

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.590 
extremely expensive and it's going to be
twice<00:05:21.410> as<00:05:21.740> abrasion<00:05:22.580> resistant<00:05:23.060> as<00:05:23.180> super

twice as abrasion resistant as super

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.390 
twice as abrasion resistant as super
fabric<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.050> has<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.350> very<00:05:24.650> dense<00:05:24.920> foam<00:05:25.190> behind

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.800 
fabric and has a very dense foam behind
it<00:05:25.730> so<00:05:25.850> it's<00:05:25.970> also<00:05:26.180> going<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.510> anticipate

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
it so it's also going to anticipate

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.230 
it so it's also going to anticipate
impact<00:05:27.530> upon<00:05:28.160> putting<00:05:28.430> your<00:05:28.610> hands<00:05:28.850> down<00:05:28.970> so

impact upon putting your hands down so

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.900 
impact upon putting your hands down so
again<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.660> huge<00:05:30.110> upgrade<00:05:30.500> again<00:05:31.250> adding<00:05:31.700> to<00:05:31.820> the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
again a huge upgrade again adding to the

on the seams

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.720 
on the seams
I<00:05:57.320> like<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.770> external<00:05:58.220> stitches<00:05:58.520> on<00:05:58.670> the

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
I like the external stitches on the

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.190 
I like the external stitches on the
fingers<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.180> don't<00:05:59.540> believe<00:05:59.750> that<00:05:59.780> you<00:06:00.020> feel

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
fingers I don't believe that you feel

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.930 
fingers I don't believe that you feel
them<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.470> they're<00:06:00.590> overly<00:06:01.010> narrow<00:06:01.250> here<00:06:01.550> just

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
them and they're overly narrow here just

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.090 
them and they're overly narrow here just
in<00:06:02.090> my<00:06:02.360> opinion<00:06:02.810> I<00:06:02.930> like<00:06:03.170> race<00:06:03.380> gloves<00:06:03.680> with

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
in my opinion I like race gloves with

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.160 
in my opinion I like race gloves with
the<00:06:04.130> stitching<00:06:04.580> on<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.850> outside<00:06:05.330> moving<00:06:06.050> down

the stitching on the outside moving down
you're<00:06:06.470> going<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.710> see<00:06:06.890> that<00:06:07.100> we<00:06:07.220> have<00:06:07.310> a<00:06:07.340> full

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
you're going to see that we have a full

covering up your wrist adjuster and then

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.290 
covering up your wrist adjuster and then
we're<00:06:11.990> dual<00:06:12.230> cuff<00:06:12.700> so<00:06:13.700> if<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:13.850> open<00:06:14.000> it<00:06:14.210> up

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
we're dual cuff so if you open it up

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.720 
we're dual cuff so if you open it up
you're<00:06:14.720> going<00:06:14.870> to<00:06:15.020> see<00:06:15.200> a<00:06:15.230> mixture<00:06:15.650> of<00:06:15.800> your

goat skin your perforated goat skin as

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.830 
goat skin your perforated goat skin as
we<00:06:19.100> bring<00:06:19.280> it<00:06:19.400> over<00:06:19.640> the<00:06:19.730> top<00:06:19.970> micro<00:06:20.420> velcro

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
we bring it over the top micro velcro

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.060 
we bring it over the top micro velcro
pulling<00:06:21.140> it<00:06:21.230> together<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:21.680> it's<00:06:21.800> not<00:06:21.860> going<00:06:21.980> to

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
pulling it together so it's not going to

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.220 
pulling it together so it's not going to
bite<00:06:22.250> anything<00:06:22.610> and<00:06:22.760> nice<00:06:23.150> big<00:06:23.360> TPR<00:06:23.900> so<00:06:24.110> that

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
bite anything and nice big TPR so that

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.840 
bite anything and nice big TPR so that
you<00:06:24.320> could<00:06:24.440> find<00:06:24.650> the<00:06:24.770> edge<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:25.040> it<00:06:25.130> as<00:06:25.250> well<00:06:25.760> as

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
you could find the edge of it as well as

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.850 
you could find the edge of it as well as
you<00:06:25.880> can<00:06:26.060> see<00:06:26.120> how<00:06:26.420> far<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:26.930> TPU<00:06:27.590> on<00:06:27.770> the
