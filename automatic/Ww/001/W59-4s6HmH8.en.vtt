00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
one thing that I gotta learn how to do

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
one thing that I gotta learn how to do
is<00:01:13.170> check<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> ball<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.040> obviously

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is check the ball down but obviously

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130
