00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.410
 there is everybody knows said saw 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.410
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.879
 huge video and I have a huge but that at 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.840
 side of me too it's called how 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:44.390
 this for a little video announcement on 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 the new oddity case of which bordelais 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:55.610
 - I want to talk it's okay not 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.119
 we will stay serious and it concerns the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.739
 again the call of duty therefore released on 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.119
 second quarter 2013 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.710
 so that's a first date of 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.790
 exit that goes there official like you 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 know that the first dates of 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.960
 exits are never well respected 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 as you could see for gta 5 by 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.040
 example here I was at 5 or for 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.360
 spring 2013 is welcome at the end of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.540
 account it's end of year for its purposes of 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.460
 month 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.659
 so we will give you all the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.100
 information then you have to know that 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.110
 black ops two releases not a long time 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.610
 so we had little information and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.990
 mostly rumors but we will try 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.060
 to group them together to get the most 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.980
 possible to make a video 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 so the first one would be especially so 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.820
 as we said the date and the second this 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.770
 would be a new graphical engine 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.120
 here and on what console they go 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.890
 go out and on which we know very well 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.810
 that the males at 720 and the pesca must 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.920
 go out in the dance and at the end of the year 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.690
 next this year or the year 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 next we spoke trailer 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.380
 playstation which are a little blurry here 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.900
 here it is not yet what they are 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.710
 really official too so here it is 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.659
 need to know new graphics engine 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.760
 especially juice for new consoles 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.620
 to my friend it was planned that then we have 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 there they say they are going more and more 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.610
 powerful my opinion we see sells more 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.060
 in addition to ordinary graphics 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.830
 ordinary and extraordinary then a game 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.640
 who will turn a little bit maybe to the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.080
 battle field 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 the graphic engine calves we do not know 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.019
 too much we do not have too much of a food what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
 the mode of the game modes stay 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.200
 still a little bit that's how we 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.970
 call it faithful to the final of duty and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 will not change like a battlefield 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.140
 we can also note that battlefield has 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 finally announced it's not good up 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.549
 and the new battlefield four months ago 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 for that lighthouse model is a small 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.209
 little promoted and farms and buttocks 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 this is going to say and so we have another 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.519
 information also apart from the engine 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.980
 graphic 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.120
 a little information about this 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.880
 who seems the soul the campaign mode 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.580
 serene 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.530
 change and he would resume resignation from 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.450
 modern warfare 2 against four here 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.490
 and so it's a shame I find it a shame 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.680
 if it turned out because it's a little 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.120
 a laziness on their part to say that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.260
 the countryside is not long if you are 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 obliged to resume the missions we have 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.510
 already done before 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.580
 after that maybe it will be missions 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 bonus he salutes what happened his 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.270
 resignation bonus hockey after if it's 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.260
 in the after sick like that all that 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.550
 is that rumors we have little 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.230
 information from the community as we 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.300
 said it came out not long ago we 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.560
 still wanted to look at the dates to 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.480
 my opinion is a bit like usual 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.610
 it will be between September and December 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 that's back to school a sick person 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.940
 sick you know it right after that's 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.170
 always by the key somehow 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.970
 especially in November they go out mostly 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.460
 in November so it's always there 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.480
 that call of duty so new 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.670
 graphic engine for news 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.090
 consoles here alas well speaking of 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.310
 new consoles the game would come out already 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.590
 we are sure and without confirming it on the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.060
 xbox 360 and the ps3 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.990
 after she would go out on the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.990
 ps4 the xbox 720 all depends on the time 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.120
 they leave here their outputs 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.270
 and would also be a 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.920
 out on the nintendo wii or but good 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.710
 by cons as you know to my 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.020
 notice the fps on the nintendo it was 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.770
 a great luxury in Indian success that did not 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.840
 never walked 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.250
 so after that who knows maybe there 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.670
 will have a big surprise we'll see 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.690
 and then and that's good after that 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.890
 it's a little bit all 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.750
 information that we were better able to 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.240
 collect for flagship model that be 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.090
 so here we go and try to 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.190
 gather lots of information during 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.020
 weeks and all and then as soon as we have 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.760
 found plenty of information we will 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.170
 redo some videos a little at each 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.120
 times and so 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.770
 and so here it is a little bit all 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.260
 for this time and then we will put the 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.810
 links of course our information and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.910
 these are our sources we will say in the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.210
 description to prove you a little 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.190
 little 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.250
 that basically we do not tell you 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.569
 nonsense and that you have to dare quickly they 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.710
 tell us who we are going to say because 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.069
 after people believe it's 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.990
 no more not believe on the road 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.270
 there is vincenzo m he took me back I believed 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.039
 that I was going to be hit 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.720
 So here you go, so it's a bit 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.449
 the end of fast video video to give 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.729
 some information we liked and 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.130
 I think that's more interesting 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.979
 to remember in all this is especially the 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.780
 new web graphics engine and the 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.860
 new consoles that are going out we're going 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.669
 try to have information too 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.169
 regarding new consoles this is 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.340
