00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
all right in this tutorial I'm gonna be

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.800 
all right in this tutorial I'm gonna be
showing<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.939> run<00:00:03.179> two<00:00:03.419> guitars

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
showing you how to run two guitars

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.369 
showing you how to run two guitars
through<00:00:04.200> one<00:00:04.529> axe<00:00:04.859> effects<00:00:05.430> see<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.759> it<00:00:05.879> it

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
through one axe effects see in it it

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.620 
through one axe effects see in it it
works<00:00:07.379> through<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.250> regular<00:00:08.730> ex<00:00:08.940> effects<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
works through the regular ex effects the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.450 
works through the regular ex effects the
X<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.960> X<00:00:10.139> ultra<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> X<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.969> X<00:00:12.150> 2<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> you

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
X of X ultra and the X of X 2 so you

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.550 
X of X ultra and the X of X 2 so you
would<00:00:14.580> want<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:16.170> can't

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
would want to do this if you can't

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.609 
would want to do this if you can't
afford<00:00:16.940> two<00:00:17.940> different<00:00:18.359> acts<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.690> X's<00:00:19.170> for

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
afford two different acts of X's for

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.390 
afford two different acts of X's for
each<00:00:20.550> guitarist<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.390> your<00:00:21.510> band<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.400> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
each guitarist and your band and that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
each guitarist and your band and that
way<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> could<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:23.939> maybe<00:00:24.390> split<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> cost

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
way you could just maybe split the cost

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.380 
way you could just maybe split the cost
with<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.590> other<00:00:25.710> guitarist<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with your other guitarist and get the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
with your other guitarist and get the
same<00:00:27.630> great<00:00:27.900> tone<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.650> unit<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
same great tone through one unit so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.749 
same great tone through one unit so
basically<00:00:30.470> how<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.529> start<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.160> off<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
basically how we start this off is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
basically how we start this off is
you're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.890> i/o

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you're going to want to go to the i/o

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.119 
you're going to want to go to the i/o
button<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.710> you're<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.070> to

button and you're going to want to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.510 
button and you're going to want to
select<00:00:38.370> analog<00:00:39.270> rear<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.559> select

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
select analog rear now this will select

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
select analog rear now this will select
the<00:00:41.760> inputs<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> rear<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.110> ax

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the inputs on the rear of your ax

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
the inputs on the rear of your ax
effects<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.879> important<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
effects it's really important that you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.750 
effects it's really important that you
do<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.620> next<00:00:47.070> thing<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.670> going

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
do that the next thing that we're going

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
do that the next thing that we're going
to<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to look at is we're going to go to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.920 
to look at is we're going to go to
layout<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.890> gate

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
layout and we're gonna look at the gate

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
layout and we're gonna look at the gate
we'll<00:00:54.930> talk<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.500> later<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.460> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we'll talk about this later but it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
we'll talk about this later but it's
important<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> gate<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
important that when you put the gate in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.830 
important that when you put the gate in
that<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.820> SC<00:01:00.890> SEL<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.640> input<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.480> because

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that the SC SEL is on input two because

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.479 
that the SC SEL is on input two because
you're<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> put<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> gate<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you're gonna want to put a gate on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
you're gonna want to put a gate on the
second<00:01:05.880> guitar<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> doesn't<00:01:06.960> run<00:01:07.170> off

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
second guitar because it doesn't run off

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
second guitar because it doesn't run off
the<00:01:07.530> regular<00:01:07.710> gate<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> X<00:01:08.520> effects

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the regular gate of the X effects

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.420 
the regular gate of the X effects
so<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:11.880> gonna<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
so now what we're gonna look at is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.249 
so now what we're gonna look at is
basically<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> second<00:01:15.060> guitar<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:16.080> be

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
basically the second guitar is gonna be

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710 
basically the second guitar is gonna be
running<00:01:16.590> off<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.490> effects<00:01:17.939> loop<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
running off of the effects loop which is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
running off of the effects loop which is
input<00:01:18.960> two<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> back<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> axe-fx

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
input two on the back of the axe-fx

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.770 
input two on the back of the axe-fx
it<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> running<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.150> underneath

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it is gonna be running right underneath

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.399 
it is gonna be running right underneath
your<00:01:25.259> regular<00:01:25.680> guitar<00:01:25.799> input<00:01:26.250> signal<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
your regular guitar input signal and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
your regular guitar input signal and
just<00:01:28.409> straight<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> have

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
just straight out like so so what I have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
just straight out like so so what I have
here<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.759> one<00:01:35.759> guitar<00:01:35.970> running<00:01:36.659> clean

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
here is I have one guitar running clean

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.980 
here is I have one guitar running clean
and<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.860> guitar<00:01:38.100> running<00:01:39.090> distortion<00:01:39.720> just

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and one guitar running distortion just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.240 
and one guitar running distortion just
to<00:01:40.110> show<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.799> two<00:01:41.040> different

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to show that you could do two different

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.980 
to show that you could do two different
types<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.939> ant<00:01:42.180> models<00:01:42.829> through<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.040> unit<00:01:44.399> so

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
types of ant models through one unit so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.460 
types of ant models through one unit so
guitar<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> distortion

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.450 

and<00:01:51.660> guitar<00:01:52.660> 2<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.440> clean

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.990 

and<00:01:59.080> the<00:02:00.080> cool<00:02:00.320> thing<00:02:00.590> about<00:02:00.620> that<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.970> that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
and the cool thing about that is is that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.930 
and the cool thing about that is is that
in<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:03.290> volume<00:02:03.890> you're<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.700> want<00:02:04.880> to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.720 
in the volume you're going to want to
put<00:02:05.150> volume<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.500> each<00:02:06.770> one<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.190> your<00:02:07.310> guitar

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.120 
left and right speaker to maintain the
integrity<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.830> your<00:02:19.580> guitar<00:02:19.940> signals<00:02:20.510> live<00:02:21.500> so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
integrity of your guitar signals live so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.060 
integrity of your guitar signals live so
the<00:02:22.340> mixing<00:02:22.730> guy<00:02:22.910> could<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:24.140> know<00:02:24.290> boost<00:02:24.770> one

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
the mixing guy could you know boost one

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.540 
the mixing guy could you know boost one
signal<00:02:25.610> or<00:02:26.360> visit<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.780> other<00:02:26.900> one<00:02:27.200> without

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
signal or visit the other one without

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.390 
signal or visit the other one without
boosting<00:02:28.550> them<00:02:28.700> both<00:02:28.910> at<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> same<00:02:29.360> time<00:02:30.400> so

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
boosting them both at the same time so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.710 
boosting them both at the same time so
that's<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:31.760> important<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.480> pan

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
that's really important that you pan

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.370 
that's really important that you pan
each<00:02:32.900> guitar<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.530> left<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> right<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.000> have

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
each guitar to left and right so I have

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.480 
each guitar to left and right so I have
one<00:02:36.380> guitar<00:02:36.590> pan<00:02:37.400> left<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.540> other<00:02:38.750> guitar

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
one guitar pan left and the other guitar

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.070 
one guitar pan left and the other guitar
hand<00:02:40.490> right

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.660 

so<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.890> what<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.100> connection<00:02:46.520> looks

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so this is what the connection looks

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.440 
so this is what the connection looks
like<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.210> back<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.840> got<00:02:48.020> input<00:02:48.200> one

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
like in the back you got input one

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.140 
like in the back you got input one
guitar<00:02:50.450> one<00:02:51.020> plugged<00:02:51.470> into<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.430> left<00:02:52.730> mono

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
guitar one plugged into the left mono

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.730 
guitar one plugged into the left mono
jack<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:54.110> got<00:02:54.260> input<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.930> Tartu<00:02:57.410> plugged

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
jack you got input to the Tartu plugged

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.980 
jack you got input to the Tartu plugged
also<00:02:58.190> into<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.520> left<00:02:58.760> mono<00:02:59.090> jack<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.840> that's

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
also into the left mono jack and that's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.720 
also into the left mono jack and that's
the<00:03:00.140> guitar<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.440> runs<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.100> effects<00:03:01.460> loop

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the guitar that runs to the effects loop

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.000 
the guitar that runs to the effects loop
and<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:04.220> got<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.640> output<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.470> got<00:03:06.650> two

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and you got on output one you got two

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.460 
and you got on output one you got two
speaker<00:03:07.400> cables<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:08.180> into<00:03:08.720> two<00:03:09.320> different

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
speaker cables going into two different

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.680 
speaker cables going into two different
speakers<00:03:12.730> one<00:03:13.730> more<00:03:13.910> thing<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.330> wanted<00:03:14.570> to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
speakers one more thing that I wanted to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.550 
speakers one more thing that I wanted to
touch<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.170> before<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.590> left<00:03:15.950> is<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:17.380> might<00:03:18.380> not

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
touch on before I left is that might not

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.830 
touch on before I left is that might not
think<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.920> using<00:03:19.580> one<00:03:19.730> acts<00:03:19.970> effects<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.570> a

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
think that using one acts effects is a

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.860 
think that using one acts effects is a
very<00:03:21.110> applicable<00:03:21.440> situation<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.480> band

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
very applicable situation for a band

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.740 
very applicable situation for a band
that<00:03:23.990> switches<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.190> know<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:26.240> guitar<00:03:26.420> to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
that switches you know one guitar to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.470 
that switches you know one guitar to
clean<00:03:27.050> one<00:03:27.440> guitar<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.010> distortion<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.360> know

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
clean one guitar to distortion you know

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.730 
clean one guitar to distortion you know
pretty<00:03:29.810> often<00:03:30.650> during<00:03:31.120> your<00:03:32.120> set<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:33.350> you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
pretty often during your set but you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.770 
pretty often during your set but you
could<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.070> do<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> quite<00:03:35.030> well<00:03:35.060> with

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
could actually do that quite well with

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.770 
could actually do that quite well with
one<00:03:36.050> unit<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:37.160> basically<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.240> keep<00:03:38.450> one

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
one unit you basically just keep one

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.990 
one unit you basically just keep one
patch<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.350> same<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.070> one<00:03:40.280> guitarist<00:03:40.790> could

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
patch the same and one guitarist could

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.370 
patch the same and one guitarist could
just<00:03:41.410> switch<00:03:42.410> between<00:03:42.680> different<00:03:43.280> patches

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
just switch between different patches

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.650 
just switch between different patches
with<00:03:45.380> only<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.860> lower<00:03:46.040> patch<00:03:46.340> changing<00:03:47.000> or

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
with only that lower patch changing or

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.510 
with only that lower patch changing or
the<00:03:47.900> upper<00:03:48.290> patch<00:03:48.500> whichever<00:03:48.980> guitar<00:03:49.340> needs

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
the upper patch whichever guitar needs

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.480 
the upper patch whichever guitar needs
to<00:03:49.730> change<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:51.560> could<00:03:51.770> do<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.130> by<00:03:52.459> just

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
to change so you could do that by just

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.420 
to change so you could do that by just
getting<00:03:52.850> any<00:03:53.450> sort<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.380> MIDI<00:03:54.590> controller<00:03:55.070> a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
getting any sort of MIDI controller a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.980 
getting any sort of MIDI controller a
lot<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.760> people<00:03:56.000> don't<00:03:56.180> know<00:03:56.330> that<00:03:56.360> any<00:03:56.750> sort

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
lot of people don't know that any sort

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.440 
lot of people don't know that any sort
of<00:03:57.110> mini<00:03:57.320> controller<00:03:57.770> could<00:03:57.950> work<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
of mini controller could work with the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.570 
of mini controller could work with the
ax<00:03:59.630> effects<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:02.360> don't<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.780> buy<00:04:02.959> that

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
ax effects so you don't have to buy that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.120 
ax effects so you don't have to buy that
like<00:04:04.660> $700<00:04:05.660> one<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.110> they<00:04:06.260> use<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.980> could

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
like $700 one that they use you could

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.720 
like $700 one that they use you could
just<00:04:07.310> buy<00:04:07.520> any<00:04:08.390> old<00:04:08.690> cheap<00:04:08.990> one<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:10.610> could

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
just buy any old cheap one and you could

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:22.460 
just buy any old cheap one and you could
program<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.750> work<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.230> your<00:04:12.800> axe<00:04:12.980> effects

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.530 

you
