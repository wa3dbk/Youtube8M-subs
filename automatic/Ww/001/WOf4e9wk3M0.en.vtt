definitely a more natural and less
side-effect<00:00:29.699> option<00:00:30.119> than<00:00:30.269> your<00:00:30.510> typical

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
side-effect option than your typical

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
over-the-counter medication yeah I know
it<00:00:32.669> works<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> wasn't<00:00:33.510> sure<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it works for me but I wasn't sure if it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.569 
it works for me but I wasn't sure if it
was<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> mental<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.469> or<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.980> actually<00:00:35.100> did

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
was a mental thing or it actually did

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
was a mental thing or it actually did
work<00:00:35.820> no<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.300> definitely<00:00:36.420> works<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> mean<00:00:37.140> any

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
work no it definitely works I mean any

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
work no it definitely works I mean any
liquid<00:00:37.920> or<00:00:38.040> steamy<00:00:38.399> broth<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
liquid or steamy broth is going to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
liquid or steamy broth is going to
loosen<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> mucus<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.379> loosen<00:00:40.680> congestion

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
loosen the mucus and loosen congestion

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
loosen the mucus and loosen congestion
so<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.700> sense<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so in that sense like that's that's the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.510 
so in that sense like that's that's the
main<00:00:43.469> component<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> soup<00:00:44.309> that's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
main component of the soup that's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
main component of the soup that's
helpful<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> speeds<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
helpful and it you know it speeds up the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
helpful and it you know it speeds up the
flow<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> mucus<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.989> reduces

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
flow of the mucus so it actually reduces

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
flow of the mucus so it actually reduces
the<00:00:49.649> amount<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> virus<00:00:50.879> stays

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the amount of time that the virus stays

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
the amount of time that the virus stays
on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> nasal<00:00:51.510> passageways<00:00:52.199> which<00:00:52.440> will

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on the nasal passageways which will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160 
on the nasal passageways which will
speed<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.219> recovery<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:54.300> also<00:00:54.480> prevents

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
speed up recovery it also prevents

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.869 
speed up recovery it also prevents
dehydration<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.190> helps<00:00:56.640> sort<00:00:56.820> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
dehydration which also helps sort of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
dehydration which also helps sort of
reduce<00:00:57.090> those<00:00:57.270> cold<00:00:57.600> symptoms<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> salty

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
reduce those cold symptoms and the salty

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
reduce those cold symptoms and the salty
broth<00:00:58.920> will<00:00:59.160> help<00:00:59.340> soothe<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.820> sore<00:01:00.030> throat<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
broth will help soothe a sore throat so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.139 
broth will help soothe a sore throat so
lots<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> benefits<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.850> better

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
lots of benefits here now is it better

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
lots of benefits here now is it better

soup<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.700> reduce<00:01:33.180> cold<00:01:33.509> symptoms<00:01:33.659> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
soup that can reduce cold symptoms now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
soup that can reduce cold symptoms now
is<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> difference<00:01:35.070> between<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
is there a difference between the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
is there a difference between the
homemade<00:01:35.909> chicken<00:01:36.119> noodle<00:01:36.240> soup<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> cans

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
homemade chicken noodle soup or the cans

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
homemade chicken noodle soup or the cans
so<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> study<00:01:37.920> actually<00:01:38.310> tested<00:01:38.729> 13

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so the study actually tested 13

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
so the study actually tested 13
different<00:01:39.570> canned<00:01:40.020> soup<00:01:40.259> varieties<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.040> they

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
different canned soup varieties and they

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.010 
different canned soup varieties and they
did<00:01:41.369> find<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.880> most<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.450> work<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
did find that most of them work just the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
did find that most of them work just the
same<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.320> fresh<00:01:43.530> soup<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> say

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
same as fresh soup now I want to say

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
same as fresh soup now I want to say
that<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> disclaimer<00:01:45.329> fresh<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> always

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that with a disclaimer fresh is always

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.710 
that with a disclaimer fresh is always
best<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.759> antioxidants<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
best it has more antioxidants and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.940 
best it has more antioxidants and
there's<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.229> those<00:01:49.350> chemicals<00:01:49.799> lurking

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
there's you know those chemicals lurking

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
there's you know those chemicals lurking
in<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.399> these<00:01:50.759> cans<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.329> BPA<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.869> we've

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
in these these cans like BPA that we've

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
in these these cans like BPA that we've
been<00:01:52.140> hearing<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.979> definitely<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.610> be

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
been hearing about so definitely one be

careful know is there a specific

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
careful know is there a specific
ingredient<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.860> should<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.460> included<00:01:56.880> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ingredient that should be included in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490 
ingredient that should be included in
the<00:01:57.090> chicken<00:01:57.360> real<00:01:57.479> super<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:57.990> making<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the chicken real super that's making it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.660 
the chicken real super that's making it
work<00:01:58.740> yeah<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.369> good<00:01:59.460> question

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
work yeah it's a really good question

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.530 
work yeah it's a really good question
that's<00:02:00.000> actually<00:02:00.270> what's<00:02:00.420> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that's actually what's really

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
that's actually what's really
interesting<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.320> study<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:02.189> really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
interesting about this study they really

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
interesting about this study they really
didn't<00:02:03.149> they<00:02:03.270> couldn't<00:02:03.630> weed<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.140> which

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
didn't they couldn't weed out which

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
didn't they couldn't weed out which
particular<00:02:04.759> ingredient<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.909> helping<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
particular ingredient was helping the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.449 
particular ingredient was helping the
cold<00:02:06.630> symptoms<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.290> subside<00:02:07.680> it's

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
cold symptoms you know subside it's

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.089 
cold symptoms you know subside it's
really<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.259> totality<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.500> soup<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
really the the totality of the soup that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.630 
really the the totality of the soup that
magical<00:02:11.819> some

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
magical some

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.610 
magical some
that's<00:02:12.880> making<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.450> work<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.170> back<00:02:14.319> maybe

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that's making it work the back maybe

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620 
that's making it work the back maybe
it's<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.100> little<00:02:15.220> bit<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.520> grandmas<00:02:15.910> love<00:02:16.030> in

special<00:02:21.490> substance<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.240> something<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
special substance is something in the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.290 
special substance is something in the
broth<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.590> that's<00:02:23.770> why<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.880> for<00:02:25.209> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
broth and that's why you know for for to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
broth and that's why you know for for to
reduce<00:02:25.540> cold<00:02:25.780> symptoms<00:02:25.930> nobody<00:02:26.770> suggests

pureed<00:02:27.610> carrots<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.450> actual<00:02:28.840> soup<00:02:29.320> that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
pureed carrots it's the actual soup that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.830 
pureed carrots it's the actual soup that
works<00:02:29.800> okay<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.670> think<00:02:30.850> your<00:02:31.300> verdict<00:02:31.690> is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
works okay so I think your verdict is

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.630 
works okay so I think your verdict is
being<00:02:32.050> clear<00:02:32.320> here<00:02:32.350> yeah<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.370> definitely

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
being clear here yeah this is definitely

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.460 
being clear here yeah this is definitely
fit<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.390> mean<00:02:34.600> not<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.870> mention<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.290> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
fit I mean not to mention all of the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.780 
fit I mean not to mention all of the
antioxidants<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.610> soup

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
antioxidants that are in the soup

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.270 
antioxidants that are in the soup
already<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.660> broth<00:02:37.930> clears<00:02:38.380> congestion<00:02:39.100> this

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
already the broth clears congestion this

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.350 
already the broth clears congestion this
is<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.640> sure<00:02:39.880> thing

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
is a sure thing
