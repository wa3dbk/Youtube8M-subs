hey guys today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.480> little<00:00:10.460> pattern<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:12.530> images<00:00:13.530> that

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
to do a little pattern on images that

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.930 
to do a little pattern on images that
have<00:00:13.770> been<00:00:13.890> colored<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.280> Copic<00:00:14.610> markers

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
have been colored with Copic markers

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.859 
have been colored with Copic markers
using<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> colorless<00:00:16.560> blender<00:00:17.599> so<00:00:18.599> I've

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
using just the colorless blender so I've

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380 
using just the colorless blender so I've
got<00:00:19.080> my<00:00:19.109> little<00:00:19.610> stamped<00:00:20.610> image<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
got my little stamped image here and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.480 
got my little stamped image here and
I've<00:00:21.840> done<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> video<00:00:22.230> already<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.860> how<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> get

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I've done a video already on how I get

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.050 
I've done a video already on how I get
the<00:00:23.930> color<00:00:25.100> faded<00:00:26.100> out<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.520> image<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the color faded out on the image so I

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.189 
the color faded out on the image so I
will<00:00:27.449> link<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.440> sidebar<00:00:30.020> but<00:00:31.020> for

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
will link to that in the sidebar but for

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.779 
will link to that in the sidebar but for
today<00:00:31.440> it'll<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.430> making

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
today it'll just be about making

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.599 
today it'll just be about making
patterns<00:00:34.039> anything<00:00:35.039> you've<00:00:35.190> colored<00:00:35.489> with

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
patterns anything you've colored with

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.369 
patterns anything you've colored with
Kovac<00:00:35.909> markers<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.420> doesn't<00:00:36.749> matter<00:00:36.899> when<00:00:37.229> you

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
Kovac markers it doesn't matter when you

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.529 
Kovac markers it doesn't matter when you
colored<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.949> I<00:00:38.159> just<00:00:38.999> did<00:00:39.179> this<00:00:39.329> one

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
colored them I just did this one

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.209 
colored them I just did this one
obviously<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.350> did<00:00:40.499> the<00:00:40.589> video<00:00:40.710> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
obviously and just did the video for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.919 
obviously and just did the video for
background<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.269> could<00:00:42.449> have<00:00:42.539> colored<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
background but I could have colored this

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.229 
background but I could have colored this
last<00:00:43.170> week<00:00:43.379> last<00:00:43.949> month<00:00:44.069> last<00:00:44.370> year<00:00:44.850> doesn't

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
last week last month last year doesn't

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.079 
last week last month last year doesn't
matter<00:00:45.569> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.710> still<00:00:46.949> go<00:00:47.069> back<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.729> add

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
matter you can still go back in and add

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.689 
matter you can still go back in and add
elements<00:00:48.839> with<00:00:49.139> the<00:00:49.589> colorless<00:00:50.129> blender<00:00:50.159> or

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
elements with the colorless blender or

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.279 
elements with the colorless blender or
you<00:00:50.999> can<00:00:51.149> even<00:00:52.670> color<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.569> actual<00:00:54.929> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you can even color with like actual the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
you can even color with like actual the
actual<00:00:55.440> markers<00:00:56.539> just<00:00:57.539> keep<00:00:57.749> in<00:00:57.899> mind<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.229> if

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
actual markers just keep in mind that if

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.369 
actual markers just keep in mind that if
you<00:00:58.440> wanted<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.859> add<00:00:58.979> colors<00:00:59.459> and<00:00:59.729> whatnot

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
you wanted to add colors and whatnot

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
you wanted to add colors and whatnot
blending<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.469> things<00:01:01.769> if<00:01:01.979> it's<00:01:02.129> already<00:01:02.309> been

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
blending and things if it's already been

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.919 
blending and things if it's already been
colored<00:01:02.999> and<00:01:03.089> sitting<00:01:03.389> and<00:01:03.510> everything<00:01:03.780> else

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
colored and sitting and everything else

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.230 
colored and sitting and everything else
it's<00:01:04.549> you're<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> probably<00:01:05.940> end<00:01:06.180> up

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's you're going to probably end up

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's you're going to probably end up
adding<00:01:06.360> too<00:01:06.659> much<00:01:06.810> color<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> will<00:01:07.530> over

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
adding too much color and it will over

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
adding too much color and it will over
saturate<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> cardstock<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
saturate the cardstock and just make a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780 
saturate the cardstock and just make a
mess<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:09.810> once<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.950> done<00:01:11.070> coloring<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> only

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
mess so once it's done coloring the only

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
mess so once it's done coloring the only
thing<00:01:11.970> I'll<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.230> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
thing I'll go back in and that is if I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
thing I'll go back in and that is if I
want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:14.060> push<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> color<00:01:15.390> around<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
want to push the color around and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
want to push the color around and
whatnot<00:01:15.870> with<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> blender<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> want

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
whatnot with the blender so what I want

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.110 
whatnot with the blender so what I want
to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.420> add<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.020> little

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
to do is I want to add kind of a little

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.670 
to do is I want to add kind of a little
crosshatch<00:01:21.120> pattern<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> sweater<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
crosshatch pattern to the sweater here

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
crosshatch pattern to the sweater here
so<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.730> going<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.420> take

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so all I'm going to do is you just take

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.130 
so all I'm going to do is you just take
the<00:01:24.930> colorless<00:01:25.410> blender<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.480> I<00:01:27.480> use<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:28.080> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the colorless blender and I use kind of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
the colorless blender and I use kind of
a<00:01:28.200> light<00:01:28.440> touch<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.980> start<00:01:29.220> off<00:01:29.370> with<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.990> just

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
a light touch to start off with I just

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.940 
a light touch to start off with I just
start<00:01:31.350> by<00:01:31.710> drawing<00:01:33.740> lines<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.580> diagonal

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
start by drawing lines in a diagonal

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.140 
start by drawing lines in a diagonal
direction<00:01:38.480> just<00:01:39.480> like<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.970> just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
direction just like so and it just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
direction just like so and it just
depends<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.600> how<00:01:42.930> pronounced<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.160> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
depends on how pronounced you want the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.910 
depends on how pronounced you want the
pattern<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.320> leave<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> or

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pattern to be you can leave it as is or

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.120 
pattern to be you can leave it as is or
you<00:01:47.190> can<00:01:47.370> go<00:01:47.520> over<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:49.500> lines<00:01:49.680> again<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:52.130> push

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you can go over the lines again to push

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.050 
you can go over the lines again to push
the<00:01:53.370> color<00:01:54.680> deeper<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.490> card<00:01:56.790> stock<00:01:56.970> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the color deeper into the card stock and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.080 
the color deeper into the card stock and
then<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.890> lines<00:02:02.159> stand<00:02:02.820> out

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
then that will make the lines stand out

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.960 
then that will make the lines stand out
more<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.870> now<00:02:07.489> I'm<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
more so I did that and now I'm going to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.809 
more so I did that and now I'm going to
have<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.179> turn<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.200> make<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.349> easier

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
have to turn it just to make it easier

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.860

what<00:03:09.620> color<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.220> because<00:03:10.550> obviously<00:03:10.670> if

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
what color to you because obviously if

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.790 
what color to you because obviously if
you<00:03:10.970> do<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> really<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.690> dark<00:03:12.020> intense<00:03:12.440> color

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
you do a really like dark intense color

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.390 
you do a really like dark intense color
it's<00:03:13.130> really<00:03:13.730> going<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.210> look<00:03:14.660> like<00:03:15.400> strange

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
it's really going to look like strange

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's really going to look like strange
that's<00:03:16.700> why<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.880> prefer<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.390> using<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
that's why I prefer just using the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.180 
that's why I prefer just using the
colorless<00:03:18.260> blender<00:03:18.290> because<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.830> so<00:03:18.950> simple

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
colorless blender because it's so simple

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.700 
colorless blender because it's so simple
and<00:03:19.550> it's<00:03:19.700> still<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.210> it's<00:03:20.960> not<00:03:21.170> making<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
and it's still like it's not making it

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.610 
and it's still like it's not making it
completely<00:03:22.310> white<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:23.570> just<00:03:23.930> pushing<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
completely white it's just pushing the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.710 
completely white it's just pushing the
color<00:03:24.800> deeper<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.370> fading<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.850> color<00:03:26.060> out<00:03:26.150> so

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
color deeper so fading the color out so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.480 
color deeper so fading the color out so
it's<00:03:26.960> still<00:03:27.200> everything<00:03:27.680> still<00:03:27.890> matches<00:03:28.100> it's

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
it's still everything still matches it's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.260 
it's still everything still matches it's
not<00:03:28.670> making<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.970> mess<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:31.010> also<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.060> do

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
not making a mess but also it you can do

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
you use the colorless blender because

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.110 
you use the colorless blender because

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
lines and it's a lot harder to clean

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.800 
lines and it's a lot harder to clean
that<00:05:33.690> up<00:05:33.750> especially<00:05:34.530> red<00:05:35.450> Reds<00:05:36.450> are<00:05:36.600> more

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
