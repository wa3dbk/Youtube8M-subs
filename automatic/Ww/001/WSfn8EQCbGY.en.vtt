hi there alec from vacuumspot here I'm

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:07.349 
hi there alec from vacuumspot here I'm
just<00:00:06.250> going<00:00:06.430> to<00:00:06.460> show<00:00:06.670> you<00:00:06.700> how<00:00:06.910> to<00:00:06.970> do<00:00:07.149> a<00:00:07.180> quick

just going to show you how to do a quick

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.580 
just going to show you how to do a quick
belt<00:00:07.660> change<00:00:07.960> on<00:00:08.260> your<00:00:08.620> Dyson<00:00:09.129> dc40<00:00:10.590> basically

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
belt change on your Dyson dc40 basically

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.109 
belt change on your Dyson dc40 basically
all<00:00:11.709> know<00:00:11.860> you<00:00:11.920> need<00:00:12.219> to<00:00:12.309> do<00:00:12.459> this<00:00:12.639> when<00:00:13.000> you

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:13.119 
all know you need to do this when you

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.140 
all know you need to do this when you
turn<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.420> machine<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.699> roller<00:00:18.880> brush

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
turn the machine but the roller brush

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.779 
turn the machine but the roller brush
doesn't<00:00:19.570> spin<00:00:20.130> unless<00:00:21.130> you're<00:00:21.310> pushing<00:00:21.699> it

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
doesn't spin unless you're pushing it

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.079 
doesn't spin unless you're pushing it
this<00:00:22.119> doesn't<00:00:22.720> turn<00:00:22.869> on<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.050> time<00:00:23.289> so<00:00:24.099> what<00:00:24.970> we

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
this doesn't turn on a time so what we

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.329 
this doesn't turn on a time so what we
need<00:00:25.269> to<00:00:25.300> do<00:00:28.320> turn<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.499> machine<00:00:29.769> upside<00:00:30.130> down

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
need to do turn the machine upside down

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:37.350 
need to do turn the machine upside down
and<00:00:31.150> we've<00:00:31.989> got<00:00:32.940> three<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:36.370> locking<00:00:36.670> pieces

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
and we've got three three locking pieces

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.960 
and we've got three three locking pieces
to<00:00:37.510> undo<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:40.450> so<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:44.320> at<00:00:44.410> this<00:00:44.560> point<00:00:44.970> you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
to undo like so now at this point you

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.910 
to undo like so now at this point you
can<00:00:46.150> simply<00:00:46.540> lift<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.870> roller<00:00:47.320> out<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
can simply lift the roller out and

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
can simply lift the roller out and
you'll<00:00:48.010> see<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.340> reason<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:48.910> not

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
you'll see the reason that it's not

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.240 
you'll see the reason that it's not
spinning<00:00:49.420> because<00:00:50.200> your<00:00:50.470> belt<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.860> doing

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
spinning because your belt is doing

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.290 
spinning because your belt is doing
nothing<00:00:51.990> now<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.280> actually<00:00:54.700> quite<00:00:54.940> a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
nothing now this is actually quite a

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.860 
nothing now this is actually quite a
tricky<00:00:55.980> repair<00:00:56.980> in<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.210> requires<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.660> bit

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
tricky repair in that it requires a bit

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.380 
tricky repair in that it requires a bit
of<00:00:58.990> brute<00:00:59.350> force<00:00:59.490> now<00:01:00.490> what<00:01:00.820> I'm<00:01:00.910> doing<00:01:01.150> here

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
of brute force now what I'm doing here

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.320 
of brute force now what I'm doing here
is<00:01:01.450> I'm<00:01:01.540> putting<00:01:02.440> my<00:01:02.500> finger<00:01:02.830> in<00:01:02.950> this<00:01:03.130> gap<00:01:03.400> and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
is I'm putting my finger in this gap and

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
is I'm putting my finger in this gap and
I'm<00:01:04.449> lifting<00:01:05.049> up<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:07.210> part<00:01:07.539> here<00:01:07.840> now<00:01:08.969> well

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I'm lifting up this part here now well

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.870 
I'm lifting up this part here now well
since<00:01:11.799> we've<00:01:11.950> got<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.219> open<00:01:12.579> we're<00:01:12.700> going<00:01:12.820> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
since we've got this open we're going to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.450 
since we've got this open we're going to
reattach<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:14.759> tube<00:01:18.420> screws<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.569> like<00:01:19.749> so<00:01:20.460> what

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
reattach the tube screws on like so what

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.989 
reattach the tube screws on like so what
we're<00:01:21.579> going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.729> do<00:01:22.079> fit<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.229> belt<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.939> you

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
we're going to do fit the belt so you

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.029 
we're going to do fit the belt so you
just<00:01:25.270> basically<00:01:25.630> slide<00:01:26.439> your<00:01:26.590> fingers<00:01:26.890> in

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
just basically slide your fingers in

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.209 
just basically slide your fingers in
there<00:01:27.249> and<00:01:28.289> push<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.469> belt<00:01:29.649> around<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:30.189> that

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
there and push the belt around so that

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.029 
there and push the belt around so that
it's<00:01:30.520> got<00:01:30.909> tension<00:01:31.299> on<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.539> like<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:33.539> then

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
it's got tension on it like that then

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.069 
it's got tension on it like that then
we're<00:01:36.039> going<00:01:36.249> to<00:01:36.369> feed<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:37.060> belt<00:01:37.299> through<00:01:37.929> the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
we're going to feed the belt through the

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.230 
we're going to feed the belt through the
gap<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.759> our<00:01:39.939> head<00:01:40.270> assembly<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.149> we've

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
gap in our head assembly so that we've

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.279 
gap in our head assembly so that we've
got<00:01:43.389> a<00:01:43.420> small<00:01:43.749> amount<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.909> pull<00:01:45.909> there<00:01:46.289> and

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
got a small amount of pull there and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.699 
got a small amount of pull there and
then<00:01:47.799> we're<00:01:48.310> going<00:01:48.639> to<00:01:50.100> feed<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.340> through

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
then we're going to feed that through

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.870 
then we're going to feed that through
okay<00:01:53.709> so<00:01:54.189> now<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.520> all<00:01:54.670> kind<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.329> in<00:01:55.450> place

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
okay so now it's all kind of in place

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.480 
okay so now it's all kind of in place
we're<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:59.590> our<00:01:59.709> locator<00:02:00.189> in

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
we're going to put our locator in

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
we're going to put our locator in
position<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.899> same<00:02:02.079> on<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.409> other<00:02:02.439> end

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
position and the same on the other end

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.249 
position and the same on the other end
okay

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
okay

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.620 
okay
so<00:02:05.590> you've<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:05.920> got<00:02:06.219> that<00:02:06.789> can<00:02:07.060> actually<00:02:07.420> turn

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
so you've now got that can actually turn

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.859 
so you've now got that can actually turn
in<00:02:07.840> position<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.610> from<00:02:09.819> here<00:02:10.179> what<00:02:10.750> we're

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
in position so from here what we're

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.559 
in position so from here what we're
going<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.019> do<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.519> zip<00:02:12.519> this<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:13.000> up<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.480> put

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
going to do is zip this all up and put

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.980 
going to do is zip this all up and put
it<00:02:14.049> into<00:02:14.260> position<00:02:14.409> like

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it into position like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.960 
it into position like
so<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.160> be<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> little<00:02:16.490> bit<00:02:16.730> careful

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
so you have to be a little bit careful

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.500 
so you have to be a little bit careful
because<00:02:17.390> these<00:02:18.490> bits<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:19.640> stick<00:02:19.700> out<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.300> can

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
because these bits that stick out it can

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.780 
because these bits that stick out it can
become<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.870> little<00:02:21.140> flimsy<00:02:21.530> over<00:02:21.950> time<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> up

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.930 

over<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.630> wiggle<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.820> until<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
over and then just wiggle it until it

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.170 
over and then just wiggle it until it
clicks<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.280> now<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.760> need<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
clicks in like so now you need to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.410 
clicks in like so now you need to
reposition<00:02:35.410> our<00:02:36.410> feed<00:02:36.830> tube<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:38.120> without

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
reposition our feed tube on and without

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.800 
reposition our feed tube on and without
pull<00:02:38.630> out<00:02:38.750> internal<00:02:39.260> suction<00:02:39.620> tube<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:42.110> so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
pull out internal suction tube like so

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.340 
pull out internal suction tube like so
there<00:02:44.810> we<00:02:45.020> go

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
there we go

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.030
