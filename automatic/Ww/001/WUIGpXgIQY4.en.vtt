00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I wouldn't add another oil tool because

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
I wouldn't add another oil tool because
it<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.009> Crisco<00:01:17.970> oil<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.479> mean<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> mean<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
it is Crisco oil I mean I mean it is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.420 
it is Crisco oil I mean I mean it is
whaley<00:01:22.009> my<00:01:23.009> hair<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> almost<00:01:26.030> too<00:01:27.030> soft<00:01:28.430> it's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
almost too soft but I just think that I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.370 
almost too soft but I just think that I
need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> wait<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:36.689> couple<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> days<00:01:37.320> for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
need to wait for a couple of days for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
need to wait for a couple of days for
this<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:42.200> fill<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.399> lot<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> times<00:01:44.850> when

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
this to fill out and a lot of times when

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.219 
this to fill out and a lot of times when
I<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.270> outside<00:01:46.970> it'll<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.149> bigger<00:01:48.420> too<00:01:48.840> just

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
I go outside it'll get bigger too just

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
I go outside it'll get bigger too just
depending<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.130> doing<00:01:50.460> outside

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
depending on what it's doing outside

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.719 
depending on what it's doing outside
it's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.060> humid<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:52.399> whatever<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> I
