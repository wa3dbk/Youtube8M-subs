00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
are gonna be talking about beacons

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.930 
are gonna be talking about beacons
beacons<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> new<00:00:15.929> awesome<00:00:16.260> block<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:17.640> put

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
beacons are a new awesome block just put

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.359 
beacons are a new awesome block just put
into<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> game<00:00:18.449> more<00:00:19.109> actually<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.710> guess<00:00:20.039> time

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
into the game more actually I guess time

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.490 
into the game more actually I guess time
has<00:00:20.640> passed<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.720> they're<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:21.960> particularly

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
has passed so they're not particularly

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.150 
has passed so they're not particularly
new<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.539> them<00:00:24.750> after<00:00:25.470> fighting<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
new but you get them after fighting a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
new but you get them after fighting a
wither<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.730> contain<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.990> cannot<00:00:28.230> possess

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
wither you contain or you cannot possess

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.609 
wither you contain or you cannot possess
some<00:00:29.070> nether<00:00:29.279> star<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.439> make

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
some nether star and then you can make

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.389 
some nether star and then you can make
the<00:00:31.740> beacon<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:33.170> I'll<00:00:34.170> show<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the beacon and I'll show you show you

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.830 
the beacon and I'll show you show you
what<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:36.030> quick<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.690> you're

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
what that is right quick but if you're

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
what that is right quick but if you're
here<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> should<00:00:37.380> already<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
here you should already know that and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.850 
here you should already know that and
what<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.460> wondering<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
what you're wondering is how to make a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.900 
what you're wondering is how to make a
really<00:00:41.399> awesome<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.090> efficient<00:00:43.910> which

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
really awesome and efficient which

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
really awesome and efficient which
mccollins<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:46.010> beacon<00:00:47.010> beacon<00:00:47.730> pyramid<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
mccollins a beacon beacon pyramid and I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
mccollins a beacon beacon pyramid and I
was<00:00:49.440> wondering<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.100> too<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
was wondering the same thing too and I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
was wondering the same thing too and I
really<00:00:50.969> haven't<00:00:51.149> found<00:00:51.420> any<00:00:51.719> great<00:00:52.199> results

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
really haven't found any great results

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.369 
really haven't found any great results
on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.760> YouTube<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> thought<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> should<00:00:55.079> put

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
on the YouTube so I thought I should put

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.150 
on the YouTube so I thought I should put
one<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:56.539> for<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.899> people<00:00:58.410> questioning

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
one out for all you people questioning

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.540 
one out for all you people questioning
how<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.460> work<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.949> at<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> bit

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
how they work and at first I was a bit

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020 
how they work and at first I was a bit
puzzled<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.670> with<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.700> one

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
puzzled because here we are with my one

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
puzzled because here we are with my one
beacon<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.500> beautiful<00:01:07.860> blocks

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
beacon I have all these beautiful blocks

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.179 
beacon I have all these beautiful blocks
this<00:01:08.820> thing's<00:01:09.090> solid<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.160 

there<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> loaded<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.840> gems

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
there this thing is loaded with gems

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
there this thing is loaded with gems
it's<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.770> Jim<00:01:17.159> blocks<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:19.280> my<00:01:20.280> problem<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it's all Jim blocks now my problem is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's all Jim blocks now my problem is
though<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.840> beacon<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.290> sitting<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
though I have one beacon on sitting on

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300 
though I have one beacon on sitting on
top<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.210> beacon<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.900> set<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> strength

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
top and the beacon is set to strength

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.179 
top and the beacon is set to strength
now<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.509> strength<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
now have strength and that is about it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.929 
now have strength and that is about it
Here<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> am<00:01:30.360> sitting<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.290> bount<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
Here I am sitting with a bount this is

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
Here I am sitting with a bount this is
actually<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.869> can't<00:01:34.049> tell<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
actually I can't tell you how much it is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.210 
actually I can't tell you how much it is
it's<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.000> 9<00:01:36.390> +<00:01:37.070> 155<00:01:38.150> which<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.770> 164<00:01:40.770> blocks

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's a 9 + 155 which is 164 blocks

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's a 9 + 155 which is 164 blocks
that's<00:01:42.030> 160<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.640> precious<00:01:44.640> gem<00:01:44.909> blocks<00:01:45.210> going

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's 160 for precious gem blocks going

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.249 
that's 160 for precious gem blocks going
towards<00:01:46.320> my<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.799> ability<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> strength<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
towards my one ability of strength and

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.300 
towards my one ability of strength and
that<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> me<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.540> ginormous<00:01:51.540> waste<00:01:52.310> that's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that to me is a ginormous waste that's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
that to me is a ginormous waste that's
that's<00:01:53.939> crazy

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that's crazy

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
that's crazy
almost<00:01:55.500> pointless<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.790> about

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
almost pointless and if you think about

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.670 
almost pointless and if you think about
it<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.500> lot<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> material<00:01:59.450> now

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
it because that is a lot of material now

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
it because that is a lot of material now
however<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.920> radius<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> super<00:02:02.909> wide<00:02:03.090> I'm

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
however the radius is super wide I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
however the radius is super wide I'm
pretty<00:02:04.500> far<00:02:04.710> away<00:02:04.799> from<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.159> pyramid<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.729> I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
pretty far away from the pyramid but I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.609 
pretty far away from the pyramid but I'm
still<00:02:06.090> getting<00:02:06.210> affected<00:02:06.719> by<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> still

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
still getting affected by it and still

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.490 
still getting affected by it and still
regenerating<00:02:08.599> still<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.200> that's

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
regenerating still to me that's that's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.119 
regenerating still to me that's that's
really<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:10.950> worth<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
really not worth it

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.509 
really not worth it
so<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.849> thought<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:13.540> better<00:02:13.930> design<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.920> that

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
so I thought of a better design and that

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.970 
so I thought of a better design and that
is<00:02:15.700> simply<00:02:16.180> instead<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.870> having<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.439> four<00:02:18.250> layer

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
is simply instead of having a four layer

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.589 
is simply instead of having a four layer
pyramid<00:02:20.980> which<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> complete<00:02:21.939> pyramid<00:02:22.420> this

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
pyramid which is a complete pyramid this

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.209 
pyramid which is a complete pyramid this
is<00:02:22.780> complete<00:02:24.060> which<00:02:25.060> has<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.299> three<00:02:26.040> 3x3<00:02:27.040> layer

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
is complete which has a three 3x3 layer

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.550 
is complete which has a three 3x3 layer
five<00:02:27.519> by<00:02:27.730> five<00:02:28.030> layer<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.480> seven<00:02:29.079> by<00:02:29.200> seven

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
five by five layer a seven by seven

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.910 
five by five layer a seven by seven
layer<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.040> nine<00:02:30.310> by<00:02:30.519> nine<00:02:30.730> layer<00:02:31.920> but

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
layer and a nine by nine layer but

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.530 
layer and a nine by nine layer but
rather<00:02:33.069> than<00:02:33.340> having<00:02:33.579> this<00:02:33.879> three<00:02:34.150> by<00:02:34.269> three

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
rather than having this three by three

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.670 
rather than having this three by three
layer<00:02:34.720> go<00:02:34.959> ahead<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.349> knock<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.560> out

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
layer go ahead and just knock that out

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.110 
layer go ahead and just knock that out
Easy's<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.220> I'll<00:02:40.150> show<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:40.359> one<00:02:40.769> more

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
Easy's that and I'll show you one more

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.149 
Easy's that and I'll show you one more
efficient<00:02:43.120> way<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.299> do<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.719> is<00:02:44.019> go<00:02:44.829> ahead<00:02:44.950> and

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
efficient way to do this is go ahead and

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.199 
efficient way to do this is go ahead and
go<00:02:45.370> kill<00:02:45.609> yourself<00:02:45.760> another<00:02:47.730> couple<00:02:48.730> thousand

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
go kill yourself another couple thousand

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.559 
go kill yourself another couple thousand
with<00:02:49.840> her<00:02:49.989> wither<00:02:50.470> skeletons<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.329> few

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
with her wither skeletons and get a few

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.949 
with her wither skeletons and get a few
more<00:02:52.720> withers<00:02:53.109> or<00:02:54.010> go<00:02:54.730> find<00:02:54.939> a<00:02:55.030> more<00:02:55.569> withers

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
more withers or go find a more withers

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.839 
more withers or go find a more withers
so<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.409> you<00:02:56.560> will<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.799> able<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.069> get<00:02:57.250> five

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
so that you will be able to get five

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.789 
so that you will be able to get five
beacons<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:59.560> which<00:02:59.769> is<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.579> is<00:03:00.760> my<00:03:00.909> design

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
beacons now which is this is my design

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.470 
beacons now which is this is my design
so<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.859> knock<00:03:03.099> out<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.489> top<00:03:03.700> layer<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.120> 3x3

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
so you knock out the top layer the 3x3

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.379 
so you knock out the top layer the 3x3
so<00:03:05.079> now<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.590> five<00:03:05.889> beacons<00:03:06.340> sitting<00:03:07.239> on

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
so now I have five beacons sitting on

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.289 
so now I have five beacons sitting on
top<00:03:07.599> of<00:03:07.659> a<00:03:08.049> five<00:03:08.439> by<00:03:08.919> five<00:03:08.950> seven<00:03:09.700> by<00:03:09.790> seven<00:03:10.150> and

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
top of a five by five seven by seven and

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.479 
top of a five by five seven by seven and
six<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:11.349> sorry<00:03:11.980> nine<00:03:12.609> by<00:03:12.819> nine<00:03:13.150> pyramid<00:03:14.079> and

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
six and sorry nine by nine pyramid and

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.920 
six and sorry nine by nine pyramid and
so<00:03:15.489> they're<00:03:15.879> not<00:03:16.000> active<00:03:16.359> right<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:16.690> because

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
so they're not active right now because

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.599 
so they're not active right now because
I<00:03:17.079> haven't<00:03:17.349> powered<00:03:17.829> them<00:03:17.979> yet<00:03:18.159> or<00:03:18.400> haven't

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
I haven't powered them yet or haven't

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.170 
I haven't powered them yet or haven't
set<00:03:18.970> their<00:03:19.180> skill<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.579> might<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:21.940> seeing

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
set their skill but you might be seeing

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.770 
set their skill but you might be seeing
where<00:03:22.629> I'm<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:23.019> with<00:03:23.169> this<00:03:23.459> since<00:03:24.459> each

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
where I'm going with this since each

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.360 
where I'm going with this since each
beacon<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.959> only<00:03:26.079> have<00:03:26.229> one<00:03:26.470> power<00:03:26.739> set<00:03:27.040> you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
beacon can only have one power set you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.800 
beacon can only have one power set you
can<00:03:27.489> go<00:03:27.609> ahead<00:03:27.729> and<00:03:27.909> drop<00:03:28.090> whatever<00:03:28.329> gym<00:03:28.690> you

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
can go ahead and drop whatever gym you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530 
can go ahead and drop whatever gym you
like<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.319> go<00:03:30.010> ahead<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.400> set<00:03:30.669> that<00:03:30.879> beacon<00:03:31.329> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
like and go ahead and set that beacon to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.199 
like and go ahead and set that beacon to
one<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.959> sets<00:03:32.229> so<00:03:32.579> now<00:03:33.579> this<00:03:33.729> beacon<00:03:34.090> is

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
one of the sets so now this beacon is

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.050 
one of the sets so now this beacon is
giving<00:03:34.510> me<00:03:34.659> speed<00:03:34.989> awesome<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.949> so<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:36.879> think

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
giving me speed awesome and so I think

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.629 
giving me speed awesome and so I think
I'll<00:03:37.449> get<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:38.169> little<00:03:38.620> bit<00:03:38.739> haste<00:03:39.129> from<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
I'll get a little bit haste from this

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.449 
I'll get a little bit haste from this
beacon<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.220> believe<00:03:42.669> I'll<00:03:43.030> get<00:03:43.269> some

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
beacon and then I believe I'll get some

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.050 
beacon and then I believe I'll get some
resistance<00:03:45.459> from<00:03:45.579> this<00:03:45.879> one<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.819> how<00:03:49.000> about

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
resistance from this one and how about

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.580 
resistance from this one and how about
we<00:03:49.329> do<00:03:50.190> some<00:03:51.190> boost<00:03:51.609> on<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.479> one<00:03:52.659> and<00:03:53.019> for<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
we do some boost on that one and for the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.300 
we do some boost on that one and for the
middle<00:03:53.889> one

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
middle one

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.809 
middle one
we'll<00:03:54.669> do<00:03:55.239> our<00:03:55.269> strength<00:03:55.780> again<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:57.609> as

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
we'll do our strength again and just as

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.460 
we'll do our strength again and just as
simple<00:03:58.150> as<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.449> we<00:03:58.689> have<00:03:58.780> powered<00:03:59.109> all<00:03:59.229> five

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
simple as that we have powered all five

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.530 
simple as that we have powered all five
of<00:03:59.500> our<00:03:59.739> beacons<00:04:00.220> they<00:04:00.970> were<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.389> using<00:04:02.109> these

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
of our beacons they were all using these

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.259 
of our beacons they were all using these
155<00:04:04.540> gem<00:04:04.870> blocks<00:04:05.139> to<00:04:05.979> widen<00:04:06.370> their<00:04:06.669> reach<00:04:06.909> and

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
155 gem blocks to widen their reach and

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.849 
155 gem blocks to widen their reach and
I<00:04:07.840> now<00:04:08.079> have<00:04:08.439> all<00:04:08.470> five<00:04:09.009> buffs<00:04:09.909> so<00:04:10.859> pretty

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
I now have all five buffs so pretty

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.770 
I now have all five buffs so pretty
awesome<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.400> think<00:04:12.430> I'm<00:04:13.239> sitting<00:04:13.569> here<00:04:13.659> with

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
awesome I think I'm sitting here with

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.800 
awesome I think I'm sitting here with
five<00:04:14.019> buffs<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> radius<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.189> almost

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
five buffs and the radius is almost

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.020 
five buffs and the radius is almost
exactly<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.019> same<00:04:17.259> or<00:04:17.709> yeah<00:04:18.430> radius<00:04:18.849> of

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
exactly the same or yeah radius of

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
exactly the same or yeah radius of
effectiveness<00:04:20.519> but<00:04:21.519> here<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.909> am<00:04:22.000> sitting<00:04:22.630> with

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
effectiveness but here I am sitting with

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.929 
effectiveness but here I am sitting with
with<00:04:25.050> all<00:04:25.349> five<00:04:25.710> different<00:04:25.979> buffs<00:04:26.310> constantly

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
with all five different buffs constantly

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.360 
with all five different buffs constantly
working<00:04:27.150> rather<00:04:27.509> than<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:28.020> one<00:04:28.289> working<00:04:29.250> in

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
working rather than just one working in

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.059 
working rather than just one working in
a<00:04:29.430> y<00:04:29.550> direction<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:30.530> really<00:04:31.530> what<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.740> would<00:04:31.830> say

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
a y direction so really what I would say

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.570 
a y direction so really what I would say
is<00:04:32.250> put<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.729> couple<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.330> few<00:04:33.360> more<00:04:34.580> man-hours

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580
