00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.700
 5 pcb encounter here in the saints 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.700
 with my colleague franklin as 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 custom already is that I am here if it is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.310
 what I said before I started recording 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.199
 guys, I promise before I start 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.619
 record said as I come a 3 you'll see how 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 come a train lad men a hard day's 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 finding a good tram boys 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 after that this event not us 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 we expected or I have teach something very 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.090
 cool guys, something good, well, always 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 to be giving it even very much 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.059
 time upload a video of someone who 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 I had made a kind of modification 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.210
 of the game and the people are freaking out 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 the modification he made and well then 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 finally through a bag it has been 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
 got measured or what is what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.239
 It is because it is the environment tico convertible 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.460
 that is a mistake before I wanted to put it in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 bengasi in the disputable environment and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 apart they not only seemed the center 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 not well or is it also the backup in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.260
 spider format the spider format of the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 cars is usually complicated for example 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.769
 there are different cars for example the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.859
 Audio 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 I met some I love and so good 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.609
 they take out a car and after taking the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 spider version is how it is like the same 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.659
 car what happens is that improved or 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.819
 more power everything improved as 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.880
 aesthetically much more of flesh as of 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.380
 career we could say is better 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 so then this car for here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 that is a good car the most car 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 good forn shit of cars 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.189
 super because it is in the category 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.439
 of super cars the cow no no what 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.060
 I remember well but in short is in 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.130
 spider format as you see is totally 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.659
 improved not only convertible 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.429
 but it puts you on the street and two things 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.599
 whiten and back here on the sides 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.220
 in plan to make it much more dynamic 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.200
 in career plan and it's cool how 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.759
 is going the time it's cool a lot 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.349
 We are not going to test how he runs because he is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.739
 one going home either runs much that 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:52.200
 let's try the environment that I like 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.970
 a lot aesthetically it's very cool and we 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 it's pretty cool yeah well let's go 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.360
 to try the center that will surely be 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 what many wishing and as I say 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.629
 Well, this is the same center 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.579
 they spent time images of coming 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.810
 be a convertible environment and people 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.069
 he loved his profession he even 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 they sent a proposal to face so that 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.090
 they got in but they did not put it in obviously 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.300
 in flesh and bone in flesh and bone in 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.700
 metal and rubber wieser the environment 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.830
 cabriolet man is cool but in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.730
 yes yes with hood service is left 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.010
 best 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.900
 more cool because it does not look like that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.430
 strangers and cut them I think that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.739
 it really is a bit bad because he looks 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.690
 the beige back and that has as 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.920
 what is above the service head 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.209
 that should cut a little more that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.250
 it's like the convertible like very 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.690
 small we could say that the part 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.459
 back to cut it a little more and that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.320
 for a little more elongated car does not 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.060
 I say I say but anyway the case is 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.670
 that still the car is beautiful 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.739
 although it always gives you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.900
 like the part of your little one 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.670
 and honestly I love it and a lot that I do not 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.750
 I officially do not know 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.670
 why this kind of things in mind 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.129
 faces either imagine what you 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.989
 it costs to be a model to a creator of 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.060
 mods do this it does not cost me anything 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.739
 imagine the developers of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.569
 rockstar years and because the development of 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.579
 dogs carry us still stuffing things 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.560
 not the truth that I do not understand or everything 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.920
 a hoot but good that the boys 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 Here I leave the environment totally 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.139
 cabriolet the time that long that a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 through because many of you always 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.049
 you have asked me I have always 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.310
 asked and all that the center of 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.859
 mowers that the truth that I am very 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.930
 requested by the rock and nothing because here what 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 you have the same with your environment and what 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.180
 only one thing that has cool is that you out 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.180
 tablets so you can start
