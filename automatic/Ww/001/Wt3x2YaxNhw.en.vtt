00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
one was 35 bucks it's the most important

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.330 
one was 35 bucks it's the most important
thing<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:36.540> you're<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:36.870> learning<00:00:37.340> because

thing when you're first learning because

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
thing when you're first learning because
you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> instill<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> sense<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.660> time<00:00:39.899> what

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you have to instill a sense of time what

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.310 
you have to instill a sense of time what
I'm<00:00:40.829> gonna<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.370> put<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> metronome<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> 60

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I'm gonna do is put this metronome on 60

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.910 
I'm gonna do is put this metronome on 60
beats<00:00:43.620> per<00:00:43.950> minute<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:45.420> seems<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.930> should

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
beats per minute that seems like should

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
beats per minute that seems like should
take<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> minute<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.820> through<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> I'm

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
take a minute to get through and I'm

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
take a minute to get through and I'm
also<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.260> metronome<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.489> feature

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
also this metronome has a little feature

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
also this metronome has a little feature
so<00:00:51.030> it'll<00:00:51.239> give<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.079> first<00:00:52.320> beat<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.770> four

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so it'll give me the first beat of four

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.110 
so it'll give me the first beat of four
beats<00:00:55.039> for<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:57.800> now<00:00:58.800> let's<00:00:59.609> approach<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
beats for one now let's approach the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
beats for one now let's approach the
bass<00:01:01.129> actually<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.399> turn<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.030> a

so<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.780> volume<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.010> attack<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
so that the volume and the attack is the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.720 
so that the volume and the attack is the
same<00:03:11.019> now<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.079> next<00:03:12.650> note<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:13.070> quarter<00:03:13.519> notes

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
same now the next note is quarter notes

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.300 
same now the next note is quarter notes
and<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> string<00:03:15.590> I'm<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.190> play

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and on the a string I'm going to play

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.880 
and on the a string I'm going to play
four<00:03:16.609> quarter<00:03:17.000> notes<00:03:17.230> every<00:03:18.230> beat<00:03:18.470> gets<00:03:18.769> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
four quarter notes every beat gets a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.789 
four quarter notes every beat gets a
note<00:03:19.150> now<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:22.549> accent<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:24.109> second<00:03:24.650> and

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
note now if we accent the second and

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.849 
note now if we accent the second and
fourth<00:03:25.310> beats<00:03:25.720> we'll<00:03:26.720> find<00:03:27.109> ourselves<00:03:27.320> in<00:03:27.769> a

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
fourth beats we'll find ourselves in a

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.640 
fourth beats we'll find ourselves in a
deeper<00:03:28.220> groove<00:03:28.519> or<00:03:28.880> if<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.480> make<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:30.320> first

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
deeper groove or if I make this first

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.770 
deeper groove or if I make this first
and<00:03:30.859> third<00:03:31.430> beat<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> little<00:03:32.060> lighter

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.040 

it's<00:03:37.780> very<00:03:38.530> subtle<00:03:38.890> or<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:40.630> our<00:03:40.810> fearless

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
it's very subtle or is our fearless

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.360 
it's very subtle or is our fearless
leader<00:03:41.410> would<00:03:41.560> say<00:03:41.770> something<00:03:43.920> okay<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:44.980> that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
leader would say something okay so that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.520 
leader would say something okay so that
the<00:03:46.210> next<00:03:46.450> thing<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.810> play<00:03:46.960> these<00:03:47.170> on<00:03:47.320> all

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the next thing is to play these on all

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.910 
the next thing is to play these on all
the<00:03:47.680> strings<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.280> some<00:03:48.880> kind<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.180> order<00:03:49.920> we'll
