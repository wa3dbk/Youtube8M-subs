00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to make sure that the ISS was in the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.499 
to make sure that the ISS was in the
perfect<00:01:43.320> position<00:01:43.740> during<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.610> Eclipse<00:01:45.000> the

and to go through all that and shut the
cameras<00:01:57.450> off<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> public<00:01:58.259> can't<00:01:58.469> see

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
cameras off so the public can't see

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:08.960
