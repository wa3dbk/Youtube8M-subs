so Darren Bent they're gonna list them
up<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.370> 2,900<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.870> picked<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.200> amiguita<00:00:37.559> pretty

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
up at 2,900 we picked up amiguita pretty

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.240 
up at 2,900 we picked up amiguita pretty
cheap<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.570> we<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> matter<00:00:40.140> only<00:00:40.350> 49<00:00:40.950> k<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
cheap and we get a matter only 49 k I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
cheap and we get a matter only 49 k I
believe<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.510> list<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.020> nine

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
believe just list them up at nine

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
believe just list them up at nine
thousand<00:00:43.649> nine<00:00:43.680> hundred<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.480> five

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
thousand nine hundred and I think five

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
thousand nine hundred and I think five
or<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.230> players<00:00:46.530> sold<00:00:47.420> almost

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
or so these players sold almost

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.319 
or so these players sold almost
instantly<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.500> always<00:00:49.950> nice<00:00:50.270> just<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
instantly which was always nice just to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.229 
instantly which was always nice just to
get<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.840> coins<00:00:52.110> back<00:00:52.170> into<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.800> trading

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
get my coins back into some more trading

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.840 
get my coins back into some more trading
so<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.780> players<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.410> sadie<00:00:56.070> does<00:00:56.489> sell<00:00:56.699> for

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so these players I sadie does sell for

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.459 
so these players I sadie does sell for
that<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.230> end<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.440> with

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that as well I think so we end up with

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090 
that as well I think so we end up with
16<00:00:58.859> k<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.260> that's<00:01:01.260> five<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> players

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
16 k there and that's five the players

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
16 k there and that's five the players
already<00:01:02.250> sold<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.149> back<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> check<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
already sold so we go back and check and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.340 
already sold so we go back and check and
the<00:01:04.290> master<00:01:04.530> are<00:01:04.680> no<00:01:04.799> sales<00:01:05.750> Tiote<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> Darren

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the master are no sales Tiote and Darren

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
the master are no sales Tiote and Darren
been<00:01:07.500> added<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> dear<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.670> Lopez<00:01:09.030> as

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
been added by or and dear good Lopez as

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
been added by or and dear good Lopez as
well<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.820> decide<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.020> more

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
well so I decide to do a little bit more

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
well so I decide to do a little bit more
on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> console<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
on the console because I don't know the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.410 
on the console because I don't know the
web<00:01:15.810> app<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:17.009> repetitive<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
web app can get a bit repetitive but the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.670 
web app can get a bit repetitive but the
reason<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> web<00:01:19.170> app<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
reason I do it on the web app is it is

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
reason I do it on the web app is it is
much<00:01:19.860> easier<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> throughout

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
much easier i can just do it throughout

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
much easier i can just do it throughout
the<00:01:21.330> day<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.780> i'm<00:01:21.900> doing<00:01:22.020> other<00:01:22.229> things<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the day when i'm doing other things the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
the day when i'm doing other things the
console<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.740> difficult

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
console it's a little bit more difficult

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
console it's a little bit more difficult
to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.460> able<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> footage<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> stuff

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to be able to get the footage and stuff

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.340 
to be able to get the footage and stuff
for<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.310> Assaidi<00:01:30.210> sold<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.630> 4.7

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
for it and they see Assaidi sold for 4.7

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.520 
for it and they see Assaidi sold for 4.7
k<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.979> picked<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.310> acres<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:32.970> left<00:01:33.210> for

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
k and we picked up acres all left for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.270 
k and we picked up acres all left for
7900<00:01:34.820> list<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.390> 7.9<00:01:37.140> k<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.159> think

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
7900 list them up for 7.9 k and I think

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
7900 list them up for 7.9 k and I think
he's<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.490> pretty<00:01:38.640> quickly<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.119> well<00:01:39.380> same<00:01:40.380> with

in<00:01:58.229> four<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> two<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.159> two<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.540> i'm<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.630> sure

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
in four and two and two and i'm not sure

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899

think it's the next morning I check and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.360 
think it's the next morning I check and
so<00:02:23.290> actually<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.650> coming<00:02:23.890> up<00:02:23.920> about<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
so actually be coming up about now and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.550 
so actually be coming up about now and
picked<00:02:24.550> up<00:02:24.670> another<00:02:24.910> Tiote<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.570> for<00:02:25.750> 1.3<00:02:26.290> k

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
picked up another Tiote there for 1.3 k

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.450 
picked up another Tiote there for 1.3 k
and<00:02:26.860> list<00:02:27.640> them<00:02:27.700> up<00:02:27.820> for<00:02:27.880> 1.8<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
and list them up for 1.8 and so it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.830

should switch over the web app around

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.590 
should switch over the web app around
now<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:33.700> check<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> trade<00:02:34.180> pile<00:02:34.390> and
