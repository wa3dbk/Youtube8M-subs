00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
some mushrooms into a pan because I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.450 
some mushrooms into a pan because I
thought<00:02:24.770> they'd<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:24.980> nice<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.520> top

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.750 

I<00:02:29.050> literally<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.170> spooned<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.010> mixture

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I literally just spooned the mixture

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.110 
I literally just spooned the mixture
into<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.600> pan<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.580> kind<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.610> made<00:02:34.760> them<00:02:34.880> even

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
into the pan and kind of made them even

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.950 
into the pan and kind of made them even
so<00:02:35.390> they<00:02:35.480> cook<00:02:35.660> till<00:02:35.840> evenly<00:02:36.350> after<00:02:37.240> about<00:02:38.240> two

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
so they cook till evenly after about two

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.580 
so they cook till evenly after about two

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
garlicky but absolute perfection I think

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.820 
garlicky but absolute perfection I think
one<00:03:47.269> change<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.780> would<00:03:47.930> make<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.769> I

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
one change that I would make is that I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.890 
one change that I would make is that I
would<00:03:49.010> cook<00:03:49.160> them<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.430> little<00:03:49.640> bit<00:03:49.730> more<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
would cook them a little bit more so the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.809 
would cook them a little bit more so the
ones<00:03:51.050> I<00:03:51.110> have<00:03:51.260> left<00:03:51.470> I'm<00:03:51.620> gonna<00:03:51.769> cook<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.700> little

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
ones I have left I'm gonna cook a little

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.270 
ones I have left I'm gonna cook a little
bit<00:03:52.910> more<00:03:53.110> because<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.349> think<00:03:54.680> they<00:03:54.980> could<00:03:55.130> do

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
bit more because I think they could do

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.050 
bit more because I think they could do
with<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.459> bit<00:03:55.700> more<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.890> charred<00:03:57.890> taste<00:03:58.849> on

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
with a bit more of a charred taste on

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.890 
with a bit more of a charred taste on
the<00:03:59.150> outside<00:03:59.450> but<00:04:00.380> apart<00:04:00.680> from<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:01.900> y'all

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the outside but apart from that y'all

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.290 
the outside but apart from that y'all
did<00:04:03.080> good
