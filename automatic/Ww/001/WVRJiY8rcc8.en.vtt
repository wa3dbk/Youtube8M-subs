about some lithography what are we
really<00:00:40.300> getting<00:00:40.570> into<00:00:40.900> because<00:00:41.230> I've<00:00:41.440> noticed

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
really getting into because I've noticed

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.470 
really getting into because I've noticed
whenever<00:00:42.220> discussing<00:00:42.850> about<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.150> visual

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
whenever discussing about the visual

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.479 
whenever discussing about the visual
aspect<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.989> anime<00:00:44.470> it's<00:00:44.680> always<00:00:44.890> more<00:00:45.100> common

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
aspect of anime it's always more common

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.369 
aspect of anime it's always more common
to<00:00:45.579> hear<00:00:45.820> people<00:00:45.879> talk<00:00:46.360> about<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.809> animation

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
to hear people talk about the animation

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.049 
to hear people talk about the animation
the<00:00:47.559> art<00:00:47.710> style<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.129> character<00:00:48.460> designs<00:00:48.820> and

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
the art style the character designs and

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.210 
the art style the character designs and
while<00:00:49.659> I<00:00:49.690> think<00:00:49.900> all<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.170> those<00:00:50.350> are<00:00:50.530> crucial<00:00:50.769> I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
while I think all of those are crucial I

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.770 
while I think all of those are crucial I
feel<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.730> cinematography<00:00:52.300> has<00:00:52.390> always<00:00:52.570> been

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
feel that cinematography has always been

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.959 
feel that cinematography has always been
forgotten<00:00:53.170> about<00:00:53.559> usually<00:00:54.309> ending<00:00:54.609> up<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.879> be

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
forgotten about usually ending up to be

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.400 
forgotten about usually ending up to be
something<00:00:55.270> many<00:00:55.420> people<00:00:55.570> confuse<00:00:56.109> with<00:00:56.289> how

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
something many people confuse with how

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.380 
something many people confuse with how
well<00:00:56.710> something<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.129> animated<00:00:57.699> or<00:00:57.820> how<00:00:58.030> nice

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
well something is animated or how nice

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.479 
well something is animated or how nice
an<00:00:58.600> art<00:00:58.780> style<00:00:59.019> looks<00:00:59.410> which<00:00:59.890> I<00:01:00.070> guess<00:01:00.280> is

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
an art style looks which I guess is

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.040 
an art style looks which I guess is
somewhat<00:01:00.850> understandable<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.600> an<00:01:01.660> extend

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
somewhat understandable to an extend

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.380 
somewhat understandable to an extend
however<00:01:02.559> what<00:01:02.859> cinematography<00:01:03.460> truly<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.059> is

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
however what cinematography truly is is

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.850 
however what cinematography truly is is
the<00:01:04.570> relationship<00:01:05.050> between<00:01:05.170> how<00:01:05.530> everything

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the relationship between how everything

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.040 
the relationship between how everything
is<00:01:05.950> meticulously<00:01:06.250> shown<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.149> us<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
is meticulously shown to us and the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.380 
is meticulously shown to us and the
messages<00:01:08.470> or<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.679> mood<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.160> a<00:01:09.220> scene<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:10.149> other

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
messages or the mood of a scene in other

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.270 
messages or the mood of a scene in other
words<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.140> most<00:01:11.289> subtle<00:01:11.590> method<00:01:12.070> of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
words it is the most subtle method of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.820 
words it is the most subtle method of
show<00:01:12.520> don't<00:01:12.700> tell<00:01:13.000> but<00:01:13.899> you<00:01:14.259> already<00:01:14.410> know

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
show don't tell but you already know

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.240 
show don't tell but you already know
that<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:17.140> why<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.320> hell<00:01:17.560> am<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.740> even<00:01:17.979> making

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
that so why the hell am I even making

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.060 
that so why the hell am I even making
this<00:01:18.369> video<00:01:18.729> think<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.929> this<00:01:20.080> way<00:01:20.140> when<00:01:20.979> you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
this video think of it this way when you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.730 
this video think of it this way when you
watch<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.340> scene<00:01:21.550> like<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:21.880> from<00:01:22.060> Pokemon<00:01:22.539> mm

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.499 

you<00:01:30.740> know<00:01:31.010> it's<00:01:31.220> massive<00:01:31.970> not<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:32.390> because

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
you know it's massive not just because

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.149 
you know it's massive not just because
of<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.840> music<00:01:33.080> but<00:01:33.470> because<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.979> dramatic

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
of the music but because of the dramatic

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.670 
of the music but because of the dramatic
zoomin<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.360> target<00:01:35.750> were<00:01:35.869> zooming<00:01:36.259> in<00:01:36.380> on

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
zoomin and the target were zooming in on

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.039 
zoomin and the target were zooming in on
what<00:01:37.580> or<00:01:37.670> not<00:01:37.940> if<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.270> know<00:01:38.450> what's<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.810> on

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
what or not if you know what's going on

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.749 
what or not if you know what's going on
here<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.440> can<00:01:39.470> tell<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.100> scale<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.460> this

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
here you can tell that the scale of this

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.630 
here you can tell that the scale of this
moment<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.390> epic<00:01:41.869> why<00:01:42.440> because<00:01:42.950> time<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.490> time

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
moment is epic why because time and time

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.700 
moment is epic why because time and time
again<00:01:43.670> we've<00:01:44.240> been<00:01:44.270> told<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.170> close-ups

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
again we've been told that the close-ups

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.410 
again we've been told that the close-ups
and<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.979> zoom<00:01:46.190> ins<00:01:46.399> are<00:01:46.640> saved<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.299> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
and the zoom ins are saved for the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.480 
and the zoom ins are saved for the
important<00:01:47.930> moments<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:49.009> don't<00:01:49.190> know<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
important moments you just don't know it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.279 
important moments you just don't know it
and<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:50.240> think<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.509> order<00:01:50.630> for<00:01:50.899> us<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.020> truly

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
and I think in order for us to truly

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.529 
and I think in order for us to truly
appreciate<00:01:51.470> what<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.430> feel<00:01:52.729> from<00:01:52.940> what<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.270> see

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
appreciate what we feel from what we see

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.149 
appreciate what we feel from what we see
we<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.170> understand<00:01:54.649> how<00:01:54.799> things<00:01:55.039> are

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
we have to understand how things are

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.889 
we have to understand how things are
presented<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.640> us<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.119> why<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.330> gives<00:01:56.570> us<00:01:56.750> such

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
presented to us and why it gives us such

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.170 
presented to us and why it gives us such
specific<00:01:57.409> reactions<00:01:58.100> why<00:01:58.610> does<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.970> choice

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
specific reactions why does the choice

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.700 
specific reactions why does the choice
of<00:01:59.360> having<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.690> Dutch<00:01:59.869> angle<00:02:00.259> differ<00:02:00.470> from

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
of having a Dutch angle differ from

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.160 
of having a Dutch angle differ from
having<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.250> medium<00:02:01.640> long<00:02:01.880> shot<00:02:02.179> or<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.450> profile

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
having a medium long shot or a profile

interesting role in anime as we all know
enemy<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.400> 2d<00:02:43.850> therefore<00:02:44.450> we<00:02:44.570> can't<00:02:44.840> really

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
enemy is 2d therefore we can't really

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
around in a 3d space we can only

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.620 
around in a 3d space we can only
replicate<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.640> look<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.090> moving<00:02:50.420> camera

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510

I<00:02:53.540> mean<00:02:54.049> we've<00:02:54.230> gotten<00:02:54.650> things<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
I mean we've gotten things like the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.190 
I mean we've gotten things like the
lateral<00:02:55.579> tracking<00:02:55.880> shots<00:02:56.239> pretty<00:02:56.600> much<00:02:56.840> down

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
lateral tracking shots pretty much down

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
lateral tracking shots pretty much down
looking<00:02:57.829> good<00:02:57.950> enough<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.459> never

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
looking good enough that we never

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.670 
looking good enough that we never
second-guess<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.299> but<00:03:00.109> when<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.350> comes<00:03:00.530> to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
second-guess it but when it comes to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.860 
second-guess it but when it comes to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
little off-putting it's very obvious

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.229 
little off-putting it's very obvious
that<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.410> really<00:03:09.650> isn't<00:03:09.890> handheld<00:03:10.579> rather

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
that it really isn't handheld rather

that it really isn't handheld rather

though<00:03:29.900> there's<00:03:30.200> one<00:03:30.440> thing<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.800> anime<00:03:31.160> has
