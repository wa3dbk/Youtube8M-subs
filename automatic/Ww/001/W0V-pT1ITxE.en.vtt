00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 we have already seen that such a machine is the most plus photos 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.040
 one of the printers compatible with the victory in a number of people kia 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.469
 presented 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.869
 http unavailable 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.880
 for this function of millions and 4 points 2 let's see 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.510
 how does it work what it behaves using inside 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.050
 let's wait here one and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.099
 with an open mail which we are going to print 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.460
 we select the arrow 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.420
 allows us to make visits etc actions that we are going to say the option of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 to print 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.160
 by choosing them and previously we have configured your printer will appear in 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.040
 screen 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.810
 I agree if we can not click 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.920
 and select between the different 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.770
 printers that we have available 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 we grew up suck 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.100
 we can 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 handle the number of copies 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 in the sea they are less 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 and chair 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.290
 all ready we just have to click on print 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.360
 then the printing will start 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.300
 an information menu will appear on the screen indicating that we are 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 facing up 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.660
 as you can see on the screen also the printer envies us 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.080
 all those messages that we would receive in a team for example the lack of ink 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 in this case the black cartridge pz 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.120
 we click on accept and we will see how our impression has been 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 here we have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.980
 here we have our copy 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.210
 sent 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 directly interest showed that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.040
 as you can see 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.080
 Sara correctly 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 format is kept in color 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.150
 easily with a simple click we could print this cut 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 we make from a lamp 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.099
 if we do from an ipad 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.509
 it's the same option 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.889
 and we have our there is peace 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.019
 we put 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.969
 although I also strap for example 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.409
 remember that there are several applications that allow printing 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.429
 we have on the ipad 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:36.409
 the date at the top and here the options automatically appear 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.039
 having the screen 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.509
 much bigger hobbs 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.649
 maybe it's easier to click on print 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:48.879
 we choose the printer if it is not selected as you can see it is easy 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.769
 p has done in pressures through 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.959
 from there he explained 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.929
 we print 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.409
 and araya we hope 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.669
 the investment as you can see you do not need to wait long peseta paper anymore 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.529
 start training 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 As you can see it's easy but in person 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.999
 compatible with the purpose 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.839
 that lowers us to allow 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.789
 without making any configuration 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.119
 we take your device select the printer 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.539
 and make the impression 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.499
 d percent this is all we'll see in a next ipod video
