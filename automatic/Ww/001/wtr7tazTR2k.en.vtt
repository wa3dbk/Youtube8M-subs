00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello girls so we end up 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.200
 today for mamoru ruins 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.420
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 will be fun so I think I will 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.390
 learn nothing new then at each 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 once they get up on a little ride 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 on social networks so the tube 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 instagram facebook and I play a little to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.800
 my favorite game of the moment which is the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:39.090
 farm helped then after seeing 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.920
 all this I get up and I put my full 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.920
 and direction the bathroom 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.450
 so yes yes you're not dreaming I'm 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.360
 brush your teeth before and after eating 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.280
 it's a habit that our parents 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.670
 I actually kept since very small 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.530
 so here and then of course I come to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.960
 clean my face always with 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 the brightness of the day of childress cleaners 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.520
 ap it follows it all 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.100
 this is my combo of the moment of the brand 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.140
 vichy is the range aqualia spa 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.750
 and I really like these products 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.000
 they smell just divine so 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.340
 I use the eye contour pocket 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.690
 and I really need it and finally the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.930
 dynamic cream to bring me 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.930
 the hydration needed for the skin 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.759
 Then I will come brushing a little my 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 hair so I'm doing this to speed up 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.780
 their costs without the fact of my hair 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.149
 so I used to style them 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.579
 before when I go to sleep in 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.280
 when I wake up so I use the 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.409
 both products from etam 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.239
 the happy bubble in the May 2 I 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.590
 took my shower the night before so I 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.750
 do not take this morning and my shampoo 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.739
 it is the shampoo with argan 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.319
 argan oil and moving hearts 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.480
 so here's for the loaf of bread next 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:27.290
 we go back to the room so I open 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.290
 the score 2 to r I'm doing my bed 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.510
 and then it's done 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:40.540
 in addition it is super nice today 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.920
 and I'm really motivated I think 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.269
 go take a little walk with me 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:54.549
 baby afterwards up baby sleeping direction 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:57.069
 the kitchen so for breakfast 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.139
 and something I've been doing since 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.659
 I gave birth in fact it's been three months 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.150
 that I do that and frankly that has some 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.519
 virtues that many virtues so the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.340
 lemon juice 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.290
 agen this is it it acts it acts it acts 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.129
 on several on several things on 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.459
 wrinkles 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:23.319
 that's it drains it acts against the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.599
 diseases it protects you against 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.480
 some bacteria finally that's it 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.949
 really only qualities that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.040
 benefits 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.669
 then here I make my my breakfast 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.419
 so 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.979
 I alternate either soy milk or yogurt 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.430
 soy today is having found 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:45.069
 soybean small rice cakes my tea 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.889
 with mint all hot really gives 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.019
 desire 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.099
 some relay acted so that's it 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.379
 two fines and actually my little 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:04:00.250
 apricot jam so here I try 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 to be very careful in the morning and 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.479
 eat pretty balanced I really 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.120
 I really did remove everything 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:09.849
 which was industrial cookies and all 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.150
 that I 'm really paying attention to that 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.409
 I eat now what is it 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.909
 that I'm doing well it's really my 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.370
 everyday routine since I am 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.409
 always on maternity leave 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.780

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.380
 I put myself on my computer while 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.080
 nibbling while eating and then I 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.689
