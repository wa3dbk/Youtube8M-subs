track here and I'm going to go ahead and
go<00:03:10.130> with<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.490> medium<00:03:11.150> because<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.570> go<00:03:11.660> easy

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
go with a medium because you can go easy

medium or hard here and you can see the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.330 
medium or hard here and you can see the
higher<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.540> risk<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.140> higher<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.800> reward<00:03:15.980> in

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
higher the risk the higher the reward in

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.190 
higher the risk the higher the reward in
this<00:03:16.460> case<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:17.510> also<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.780> different<00:03:17.930> modes

this case you also have different modes

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.990 
this case you also have different modes
of<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> sandbox<00:03:19.070> mode<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.490> can<00:03:19.640> test<00:03:19.820> out

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
of the sandbox mode we can test out

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.100 
of the sandbox mode we can test out
towers<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:20.630> definitely<00:03:20.990> worth

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
towers and again definitely worth

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.270 
towers and again definitely worth
checking<00:03:21.170> out<00:03:21.500> once<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.770> unlock<00:03:22.040> these

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
checking out once you unlock these

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.520 
checking out once you unlock these
certain<00:03:22.550> things<00:03:22.700> at<00:03:22.850> certain<00:03:22.880> levels

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
certain things at certain levels

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.240 
certain things at certain levels
definitely<00:03:24.530> something<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.800> helps<00:03:24.920> in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.610 
going to go ahead and choose my basic
tower<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.960> shows<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.410> range

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
tower and you can see it shows the range

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.220 
tower and you can see it shows the range
of<00:03:39.890> which<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.790> tower<00:03:41.000> can<00:03:41.450> reach<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:41.960> so<00:03:42.110> in

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
of which the tower can reach here so in

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.960 
of which the tower can reach here so in
this<00:03:42.290> case<00:03:42.500> i'm<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.460> go<00:03:43.550> ahead<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.820> put

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
an area that's right here around a

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.420 
an area that's right here around a
corner<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.800> want<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:38.980> put<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.160> right<00:04:39.400> there

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
corner so I want to put that right there

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
corner so I want to put that right there
where<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.360> has<00:04:40.480> more<00:04:40.750> maximum<00:04:41.620> range<00:04:41.770> now<00:04:41.950> you

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
where it has more maximum range now you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.800 
where it has more maximum range now you
can<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.250> course<00:04:42.450> fast-forward<00:04:43.450> this<00:04:43.540> because

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
can of course fast-forward this because

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.330 
can of course fast-forward this because
as<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:43.990> levels<00:04:44.410> go<00:04:44.530> on<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.830> can<00:04:44.980> get<00:04:45.100> more<00:04:45.220> and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
as the levels go on you can get more and

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.530 
as the levels go on you can get more and
more<00:04:45.400> balloons<00:04:45.790> coming<00:04:46.030> through<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.420> you're

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
more balloons coming through so you're

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.980 
more balloons coming through so you're
going<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.720> want<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.960> increase<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:48.520> number<00:04:48.910> of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
going to want to increase the number of

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.570 
going to want to increase the number of
you<00:04:49.990> want<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.260> make<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.800> faster<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.280> general

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
you want to make it faster in general

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.900 
you want to make it faster in general
now<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.760> have<00:04:52.150> upgrade<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:53.470> my<00:04:53.700> towers<00:04:54.700> here

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910

again I'm going to fast forward here

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.260 
again I'm going to fast forward here
throughout<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.130> level<00:04:57.460> but<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.060> get<00:04:58.150> the

throughout the level but you get the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.330 
throughout the level but you get the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
basic premise and as you get deeper

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.200 
basic premise and as you get deeper

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
deeper into the game you're going to get

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.280 
deeper into the game you're going to get
different<00:05:01.360> balloons<00:05:01.690> over<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.050> stuff<00:05:02.170> like
