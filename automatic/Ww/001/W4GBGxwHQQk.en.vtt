00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
dimmed out almost completely and then

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.060 
dimmed out almost completely and then
brightened<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.140> an<00:02:06.380> absolutely

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070

carbon-oxygen a very good close-up look
at<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.880> first<00:02:20.240> night<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.840> was<00:02:20.960> here

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
at and the first night that I was here

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.940 
at and the first night that I was here
one<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.420> these<00:02:23.570> lights<00:02:24.050> was<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> trees

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
one of these lights was in the trees

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.210 
one of these lights was in the trees
behind<00:02:25.340> me<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.570> right<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:28.130> was

behind me to the right and it was

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.160 
behind me to the right and it was
probably<00:02:28.400> less<00:02:28.880> than<00:02:28.910> three<00:02:29.270> miles<00:02:29.480> away<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
probably less than three miles away I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.820 
probably less than three miles away I
had<00:02:30.830> assumed<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.520> was<00:02:31.670> someone's

fluorescent yard light but the the
interesting<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.030> was<00:02:38.210> this<00:02:38.990> object<00:02:39.410> was

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
interesting thing was this object was
