 Brazilian football's idol after 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 undergoing emergency hospitalization 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 Socrates the former Corinthians player and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
 of the Brazilian team yesterday by chance

 touch our team a drink 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.680
 almost led to his death 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.400
 at the age of 57, Socrates acknowledges 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.529
 alcohol dependent 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.859
 [Music] 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 It is in the final hours the express was very 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 stronger and bigger and with much more 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.300
 commitments and responsibilities that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.760
 had Socrates talked to the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.360
 yesterday seven hours after 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 leaving hospital for 19 days in hospital 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.160
 the Corinthian idol of the heel 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 unmistakable and trained in medicine 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 spoke openly about the disease that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 almost brought him to death and problems with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 alcoholic beverage was cirrose that world 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.489
 Did you have the squad I got a point? 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 nothing so serious but was well 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.199
 organized into areas of your child and it is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 caused why because 70 lifts 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.180
 fundamentally for the first hours 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the hospital were the most delicate 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 Socrates entered through that door 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.680
 walking that had a hemorrhage 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 digestive 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 the success of the work of physicians and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.070
 avoided the death of the former player 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.720
 the end of the inflamed factor in response 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 nothing like I'm the blood pump 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.900
 dammed he's firing 1 in my car 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.299
 and it was only he who would try to do the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.119
 Max to hold his life more than 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.930
 could be difficult to open a small 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.640
 tube used to make blood circulate 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 Socrates was in the hands of a doctor who 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 possession for the rival of corinthians 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.149
 He is Saint Paul. He said he had a 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.399
 St. Paul had to save the life of a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 corinthians 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.570
 this was not the first serious problem 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 caused by cirrhosis reveals the former 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.780
 camper in the canopies of 82 and 86 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:08.009
 three months ago from the last closing 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 three months ago not usual but anyway 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 It happened in the studio but it goes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.790
 need a transplant 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.100
 probably not today salvio na 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.960
 Socrates was one of the leaders of the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.450
 of Corinthian Democracy 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.700
 the concentration is no longer mandatory 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.790
 and other issues such as 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.280
 training sessions were also decided on the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.550
 ex-celebrity never hid that he liked 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.900
 alcoholic beverage but now recognizes that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.880
 was dependent 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.700
 How did you consider yourself a doctor? 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.370
 alcoholic or not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:49.370
 Yes, when and by whom 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.190
 everyday mind the lap but you were 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.700
 dependent alcohol is the people pay 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 problem of drinking every day on the cover of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.760
 newspaper 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 a little morning or afternoon 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.210
 every day was not three months without 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.070
 drink little besides not drink 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.040
 Socrates will have to follow a diet 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:18.350
 and perform clinical exams with 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.270
 total toll frequency plus six 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:27.890
 months my son was born to conditions 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.520
 fully balance now is just the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.050
 my tunic is the still water 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520
 we both sit and chat only 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.470
 drinking water without gas 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.360
 the great challenges he had in life 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.820
 him as a football pro 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.700
 He looked the best he could and took 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.760
 of cauca is still missing. 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.920
 Socrates to recover soon is no longer 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.590
 This scare is not good for us 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.110
 A hug stays with God, and you stay. 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.480
 neglecting your health 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.380
 and you forget that you are a reference 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.260
 for a lot of people in the whole country 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.870
 The world and we'll get it from you. 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.200
 good luck 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.180
 I do not want my son to be good for 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.160
 that I can make good use of the new life I 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.340
 I see it's another life I have to know 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.340
 use 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.019
