00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
holding on to this day hoping he will be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
holding on to this day hoping he will be
in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> corner<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.210> collection<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.950> i

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in the corner back collection and i

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
in the corner back collection and i
guess<00:01:32.549> i'll<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.479> why<00:01:33.630> i

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
guess i'll go a little bit into why i

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
guess i'll go a little bit into why i
think<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.229> works<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> open<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.729> pack

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
think this works when you open up a pack

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.450 
think this works when you open up a pack
and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.250> usually<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.430> i

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and you go one by one usually what i

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
and you go one by one usually what i
think<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> game<00:01:39.030> does<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.570> randomizes<00:01:40.110> every

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
think the game does it randomizes every

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
think the game does it randomizes every
single<00:01:40.920> time<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.400> move<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:42.329> cursor<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.229> your

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
single time you move your cursor or your

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
single time you move your cursor or your
whatever<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> call<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
whatever you want to call it to the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.810 
whatever you want to call it to the
right<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.799> when<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> reveal<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
right now when you reveal all it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
right now when you reveal all it
randomizes<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.899> time<00:01:49.170> right<00:01:49.920> away<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
randomizes one time right away the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
randomizes one time right away the
entire<00:01:50.729> pack<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> i<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.810> odds<00:01:51.960> are

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
entire pack and i think your odds are

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
entire pack and i think your odds are
better<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.369> doesn't<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.000> keep

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
better because it doesn't have to keep

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
better because it doesn't have to keep
randomizing<00:01:54.990> random<00:01:55.350> cards<00:01:55.680> every<00:01:55.890> time

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
randomizing random cards every time

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
randomizing random cards every time
that's<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.969> my<00:01:57.180> theory<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that's just my theory and right here you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
that's just my theory and right here you
see<00:01:58.829> me<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.250> Reggie<00:01:59.549> White<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.969> was

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
see me do at Reggie White this was

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
see me do at Reggie White this was
during<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.479> same<00:02:00.750> promo<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> Deion

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
during the same promo I got a Deion

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
during the same promo I got a Deion
Sanders<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.880> Reggie<00:02:03.060> White<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.079> going

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
Sanders and Reggie White so I was going

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.469 
Sanders and Reggie White so I was going
pretty<00:02:04.469> crazy<00:02:04.649> about<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.299> are

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
pretty crazy about that I know these are

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
pretty crazy about that I know these are
two<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.869> good<00:02:07.049> pools<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.099> probably

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
two pretty good pools that I probably

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820 
two pretty good pools that I probably
should<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.819> uploaded<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.539> sooner<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
should have uploaded way sooner but I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.770 
should have uploaded way sooner but I
just<00:02:11.129> didn't<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.520> live<00:02:11.879> commentary<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.599> them

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
just didn't have live commentary on them

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.430 
just didn't have live commentary on them
and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.989> had<00:02:13.140> no

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and I had no

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.280 
and I had no
idea<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.130> do<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:16.080> shown

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
idea what to do about it I have shown

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350 
idea what to do about it I have shown
those<00:02:16.500> cards<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> past<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.120> shown

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
those cards in the past and I have shown

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.180 
those cards in the past and I have shown
them<00:02:18.510> pretty<00:02:18.690> recently<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:20.100> you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
them pretty recently actually so you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
them pretty recently actually so you
already<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.760> them<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.600> just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
already know I have them but I just

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.540 
already know I have them but I just
finally<00:02:22.410> found<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.830> way<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> use<00:02:23.100> them<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.490> a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
finally found a way to use them in a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.520 
finally found a way to use them in a
video<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.080> remember<00:02:25.410> this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
