00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.800

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.809
 very rich very good guys I am the 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.080
 tight and we are in a new news of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.240
 FIFA 16 as well is promised by 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.700
 twitter this afternoon there will be a lot 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.949
 information about soccer games 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.199
 here in the channel you know what they are 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.410
 something that matters to me very much 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.769
 Interests and I love both fifa 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.810
 16 as pes so do not worry about the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.759
 fans of both games because you're going to have 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.340
 during today a lot 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.920
 information of both important games 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 the first one is fifa 16 is the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 good way everything they have innovated in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.250
 career mode I think it's something that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 we are very concerned about all those who 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 we play career mode habitually I 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 I can assure you that after the fiasco 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.880
 to take me last year with fifa 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 ultimate and career mode is something to 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.800
 that me and my brother-in-law for example have 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.080
 played a lot we have taken a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 team we have tried to grow and 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.990
 to sign and that's really where we 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.479
 we had a good time I have always defended 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 the game in company in the lounge 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.229
 beer or coca cola and the sides and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 spend the whole afternoon playing so it's 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 what else do I watch because 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.039
 fifa race mode 16 will offer two 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.289
 of the most requested features 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.350
 for the community and many other changes 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.570
 important for example tournaments of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.240
 preseason during the summer months 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.619
 the main clubs to go in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 the world to prepare the next 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.929
 fifa season 16 will introduce this 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.539
 key period of mode development 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.549
 race before each season your club 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.500
 will be invited to three of the nine 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.289
 possible tournaments that are played not by 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 example in asia europe latin america and 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.270
 North America as it happens in equipment 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 Real these matches will be for good 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.549
 a perfect occasion to put to the test 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.130
 tactics alignments before they 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.010
 start the regular season and use the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.530
 reservations to refine the template 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.690
 attentive because it will be important 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.700
 prizes that we win in these tournaments 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 because they are going to swell the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.230
 budget for transfers of the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.110
 season player training 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.600
 another of the great characteristics of 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 this fifa 16 career mode not by 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.860
 example a football player trains between 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.100
 match and match to improve not in the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.750
 reality in fifa 16 the technicians 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.430
 we can train the template to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.770
 increase the attributes of the players 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.900
 and enhance its development 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.570
 every week we will choose up to 5 players 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.780
 of the template to perform different 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.780
 exercises designed and to develop 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.640
 certain attributes the objective will be 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.250
 allow greater growth of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.770
 affiliate players and still increase in 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.990
 definitive the value of the club we can 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.459
 concentrate on our stars for 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.170
 maintain a strong initial eleven 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.090
 develop the youth to 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 increase its value for a future 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.980
 transfer and be able to get even more 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.550
 funds to be able to sign or transform 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.350
 your club in the new ones to jac 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.210
 to do anything I equipment revelations of 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.120
 europe or fc to area whose academies of 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.250
 beni players are after famous 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 for having trained those who would later 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.170
 world soccer stars in the mode 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.850
 history of the fifa season 16 we 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 will immerse completely in what is the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.230
 season of a club in the version 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.450
 Spanish for example commentators 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.300
 so a lama paco gonzÃ¡lez and then 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.700
 repeat again let's hope that with 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.069
 new comments 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.900
 according to the data explain us 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.280
 graphics and comments during the game 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.170
 they are also going to offer us data 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.970
 interesting about the match with 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.310
 extensive references to the situation of 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.030
 team in the cup in the competition 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.220
 as we go 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.770
 other minor minor changes in the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
 career mode there will be many changes in 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.490
 career mode as confirmed to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.380
 all of them emerged from the comments 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.780
 and the feedback from the fifa community 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.030
 for example of agent signings 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.400
 free outside the transfer period 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.920
 we can sign whenever we want 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.350
 free agents not that we have to 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.650
 stick to for example to a period of 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.660
 specific handovers and report of 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.489
 scouts there are also improvements not by 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.810
 example after looking at a player his 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.410
 reports will be at your disposal 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.810
 during a whole calendar year before the year 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.480
 passed were three months the budget of 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.250
 transfers will now adjust more with the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.070
 realism of the club that you use in the mode 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.620
 race also can use the percentage 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.500
 of the budget left over from the season 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.540
 previous to be able to record the amount 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.460
 it will vary depending on the final result 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.250
 of the season and club goals 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.590
 the assignments the short-term pressures 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.050
 have increased from 3 to 6 months and now 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.139
 there is the option to request assignments 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.830
 of even 2 years 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.530
 substitutions and in friendly matches 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.660
 now in friendly matches there is no 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.260
 limit of substitutions at the time of 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.940
 play much more realistic transfers have 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.699
 retouched the number of movements 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.199
 important players of high level 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.690
 during the transfer period for 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.210
 better reflect what usually happens in 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.250
 the real world the value of transfers 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.500
 improved now the 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.449
 value of the players to reflect with 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.190
 Greater fidelity the functioning of the 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.169
 real market and many more 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.330
 characteristics that will inform us 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.100
 as you get closer on the date 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.870
 of the release I hope you have 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.280
 liked the information as always like 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.280
