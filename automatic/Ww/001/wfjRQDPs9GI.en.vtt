00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello there is me this is my sixth video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 and as I said in the last series and this 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.049
 the fifth video I got confused something in general in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.560
 In general, as I say in the last series 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.619
 we will soon be released and that technology 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 technology map 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.349
 will be as you see i created well and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 the first technology is the secret room 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:41.370
 I really liked this technology but 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:49.410
 In principle, very small and I'll start 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:53.180
 digging 2 in 2 I dug 4 2 depths 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.180
 and one more 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.020
 so we have four by four we probably 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 still here the benefits would go wrong 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:21.710
 then technologies can be 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.189
 build survival but on the map if you 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.140
 watched the previous video 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:32.450
 know about how the cat is talking to me 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:39.920
 there is just not seeing her she really 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:43.670
 In fact, there is even this in Parkour 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.959
 which I reviewed in the past video well 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:55.850
 probably this is all we have is ready 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:59.990
 here do 2 let's say here we 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.399
 some kind of chest for worth or in those 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:12.739
 any way this room in any 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:15.430
 If it's not up to me, we dig two blocks and 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.430
 we put here 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.800
 it means we take 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:36.769
 in general, this is her friend for each other 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:40.340
 we put and now it means searching 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.459
 it is not written, I do not have to write 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.030
 as you can see the settings are nothing why 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:58.519
 this is what i accidentally wrote it in 90 and 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:01.599
 what steps generally do here such 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.599
 decorative y 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.299
 well, 4 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 garlic 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170
 Well 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:44.560
 so it means building up here 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.990
 but here we are building up and in general I will say right away 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.690
 if well this is a regular room we can 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.880
 going to equip 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.350
 if we break this block then we 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.690
 line up such a ladder to this in 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.690
 general because of such caches using it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.610
 can do some traps in general 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.590
 that's all he wanted to say in this 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.440
 video thank you all for watching with you 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.220
 was mister bye everyone good luck to new 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.220
 meetings yet
