the<00:01:35.189> only<00:01:36.189> rule<00:01:36.549> that<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.820> think<00:01:37.390> applies<00:01:38.140> to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
the only rule that I think applies to

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.920 
the only rule that I think applies to
wigs<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.670> should<00:01:39.850> not<00:01:40.060> wear<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.390> out<00:01:40.689> of

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
wigs is you should not wear it out of

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.490 
wigs is you should not wear it out of
the<00:01:40.990> box

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the box

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.980 
the box
do<00:01:42.189> not<00:01:42.340> take<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.549> wig<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.000> go<00:01:44.189> pop<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
do not take a wig and go pop that's the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.929 
do not take a wig and go pop that's the
only<00:01:47.290> rule<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.560> think<00:01:47.590> there<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:47.979> rare<00:01:48.399> because

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
only rule I think there is rare because

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.179 
only rule I think there is rare because
then<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.329> looks<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.570> you're<00:01:49.720> wearing<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:51.159> I

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
then it looks like you're wearing what I

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.609 
then it looks like you're wearing what I
call<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.610> typical<00:01:51.909> crossdresser<00:01:52.659> look<00:01:52.869> that
