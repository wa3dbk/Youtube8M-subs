for that the problem I have is with the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.529 
for that the problem I have is with the
game's<00:01:33.140> decision<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.950> go<00:01:34.100> 3d<00:01:34.580> specifically

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
game's decision to go 3d specifically

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.590 
game's decision to go 3d specifically
the<00:01:35.720> design<00:01:36.050> decision<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.619> move<00:01:36.979> implies

now the 3ds has two screens right each

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.760 
now the 3ds has two screens right each
one<00:01:41.210> does<00:01:41.450> something<00:01:41.630> different<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.500> top

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
one does something different the top

screen<00:01:43.130> does<00:01:43.399> 3d<00:01:43.729> graphics<00:01:44.360> but<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> bottom

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
screen does 3d graphics but the bottom

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.230 
screen does 3d graphics but the bottom
would<00:01:45.410> let<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.799> actually<00:01:46.100> touch<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.820> tiles

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240

tiles instead of tiles you can touch but
at<00:01:52.580> least<00:01:52.759> find<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.119> way<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.270> take<00:01:53.509> advantage<00:01:53.540> as

bat<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.619> have<00:02:03.650> this<00:02:03.890> disconnect<00:02:04.340> between<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
bat you have this disconnect between the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.910 
bat you have this disconnect between the
touch<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> cursor<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.530> feels<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.799> bit

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
weird worst part though is how you make
