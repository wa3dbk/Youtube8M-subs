00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.370
 made of wood such details that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 going to chic language and details make 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:22.680
 such a framework it turns out anise this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:26.369
 up between the sky should be like this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:34.320
 stick here are not attacked 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:38.879
 styrene to get well here too 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.160
 will be here the store will be ready for the bill from 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:50.000
 such a spike reunion the whole load 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.000
 it turns out on the side bar that is 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.760
 picking up a honey store nothing 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 fall off so that it is convenient to cut 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.790
 styrofoam I set at the exit 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.659
 wedging a knife and screwed flight 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.080
 so that also at the exit did not pull out drank 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080
 other detail 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.090
 40 millimeters thick sawn like 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.130
 tree no fixtures 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 it turns out you do not need well, and the next knife 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 left 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.000
 I glue it together on a clamping table and 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.840
 I clamp the bottom from above but I still have to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.320
 think about the assembly process to speed up 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.800
 somehow using glue now 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.760
 titanium 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 after the sides are glued together 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.350
 I smear the inside with glue and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.540
 insert penoplex already 40 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.000
 millimeter thickness convenience it 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.300
 work that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 I cut out a little tight and with his fingers 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:48.100
 pressed and already inserted here 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:03:00.850
 tight until the glue hardened I can 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:03:01.770
 fix wooden parts I repeated 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.930
 all quarters 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:13.030
 already purchased hive everything rises on its 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.070
 places and also krishna will be suitable for 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.340
 material costs turned out to 10 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.989
 Here such buildings 1200 rubles plus two 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.570
 the day of work the wooden edges will do and for 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.620
 durable this case may take this 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.660
 place to work quarter scrape 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.239
 depending on the width of polystyrene foam 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.459
 you can probably make the game melancholy or up 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.010
 Navy corps from and all the strapping she 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.670
 will be the same their wooden handles 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.269
 will contribute 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.269
 use my lift here for a year 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.010
 about exploiting look at how they 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:04:00.340
 will stand at precipitation with 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:03.600
 so of course lightweight construction for me 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.600
 not difficult to manufacture
