in a few different ways if I turn it
over<00:02:21.969> here<00:02:22.389> you'll<00:02:23.079> see<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.530> arch

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
over here you'll see that the arch

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.009 
over here you'll see that the arch
support<00:02:24.249> here<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.609> ribbed<00:02:24.939> which<00:02:25.510> gives<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> a

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
support here is ribbed which gives it a

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.099 
support here is ribbed which gives it a
little<00:02:26.230> more<00:02:26.400> flexibility<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.609> it<00:02:28.180> conforms

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
little more flexibility so it conforms

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.959

to your arch and your foot for some
great<00:02:31.239> support<00:02:31.859> also<00:02:32.859> you'll<00:02:33.370> notice<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
great support also you'll notice this

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.020 
great support also you'll notice this
black<00:02:34.150> pad<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:34.989> which<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.950> much<00:02:36.459> much<00:02:36.669> softer

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
black pad here which is much much softer

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.479 
black pad here which is much much softer
than<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.870> gray<00:02:38.109> material<00:02:38.319> surrounding<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
than the gray material surrounding it

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.640 
than the gray material surrounding it
and<00:02:39.999> what<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.299> does<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.719> it<00:02:40.840> promotes<00:02:41.049> heel

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
and what this does is it promotes heel

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.940 
and what this does is it promotes heel
drop<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.120> your<00:02:43.359> skating<00:02:43.840> stance<00:02:44.019> your<00:02:44.650> heel

when you push actually your toes push

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.619 
when you push actually your toes push
down<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.889> you're<00:02:48.280> here<00:02:48.459> heel<00:02:48.909> drops<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.480> little

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
down and you're here heel drops a little

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.890 
down and you're here heel drops a little
bit<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.459> you'll<00:02:51.459> see<00:02:51.699> that<00:02:51.939> this<00:02:52.389> little<00:02:52.689> hole
