00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
property cards so we will say

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.369 
property cards so we will say
everybody's<00:03:04.019> got<00:03:04.079> some<00:03:04.590> part<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.010> cards

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
everybody's got some part of the cards

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.259 
everybody's got some part of the cards
now<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.440> next<00:03:07.890> phases<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.400> get<00:03:08.640> these<00:03:08.910> checks

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
now the next phases you get these checks

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.809 
now the next phases you get these checks
shut<00:03:09.660> them<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.230> remove<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> six<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.579> then

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
shut them up you remove the six and then

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.229 
shut them up you remove the six and then
we<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.090> six<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.599> these<00:03:12.690> randomly<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.970> there's<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
we do six of these randomly so there's a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.280 
we do six of these randomly so there's a
void<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:19.160> 13,000<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.340> 15,000<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.989> first

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
void a 13,000 and a 15,000 so first

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.309 
void a 13,000 and a 15,000 so first
place<00:03:22.590> first<00:03:23.400> place<00:03:23.579> will<00:03:23.970> take<00:03:24.120> 15<00:03:24.690> seconds

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
place first place will take 15 seconds

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.610 
place first place will take 15 seconds
be<00:03:25.470> 13<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.160> third<00:03:26.340> place<00:03:26.639> with<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.970> void<00:03:27.209> so

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
be 13 and third place with a void so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.870 
be 13 and third place with a void so
first<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.889> second<00:03:29.310> there's<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.609> as<00:03:29.700> much<00:03:29.819> of

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
first and second there's not as much of

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.729 
first and second there's not as much of
a<00:03:30.060> difference<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.169> don't<00:03:31.440> want<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> be

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
a difference but you don't want to be

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.199 
a difference but you don't want to be
last<00:03:31.919> because<00:03:32.130> you're<00:03:32.400> leaning<00:03:32.639> void<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.090> now

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
last because you're leaning void so now

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.940 
last because you're leaning void so now
what<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.810> look<00:03:33.989> at<00:03:34.079> your<00:03:34.260> cards<00:03:34.530> in

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
what you do is you look at your cards in

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
what you do is you look at your cards in
your<00:03:34.980> hand<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.120> everybody<00:03:36.630> plays<00:03:37.019> one

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
your hand and everybody plays one

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.650 
your hand and everybody plays one
facedown<00:03:43.579> then<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:44.669> all<00:03:44.819> y'all<00:03:45.269> flip<00:03:45.540> them

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
facedown then we all y'all flip them

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.710 
facedown then we all y'all flip them
over<00:03:46.010> now<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.190> person<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.090> lowest<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.599> he

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
over now this person is the lowest so he

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.650 
over now this person is the lowest so he
takes<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.169> void<00:03:49.730> this<00:03:50.730> person's<00:03:51.239> next<00:03:51.510> to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
takes the void this person's next to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.220 
takes the void this person's next to
lowest

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
lowest

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.129 
lowest
