and we looked at the cost for a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.280 
and we looked at the cost for a

it goes along with a reputation for

it goes along with a reputation for
being<00:02:41.790> progressive<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:43.020> feel<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.410> neat<00:02:43.890> said

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
being progressive we feel it neat said

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
being progressive we feel it neat said
might<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.820> better<00:02:45.420> quality<00:02:45.750> than<00:02:46.200> we've<00:02:46.350> had

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
might be a better quality than we've had

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.590 
might be a better quality than we've had
before<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:47.460> better<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.000> safer<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.420> our

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
before it's better it's safer for our

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.650 
before it's better it's safer for our
patients<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.320> throughput<00:02:49.950> time<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.520> better<00:02:51.480> for

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
patients a throughput time is better for

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.450 
patients a throughput time is better for
both<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.960> patients<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.710> technologists

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
both the patients and the technologists

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.940 
both the patients and the technologists
so<00:02:54.060> from<00:02:54.570> our<00:02:54.720> standpoint<00:02:54.990> yes<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> very

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
so from our standpoint yes it's a very

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.130 
so from our standpoint yes it's a very
significant<00:02:56.640> investment<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.750> feel<00:02:57.990> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
significant investment but we feel it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.330 
significant investment but we feel it's
one<00:02:58.350> because<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> quality<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
one because of the quality of the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
one because of the quality of the
equipment<00:02:59.520> will<00:03:00.150> last<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:01.140> as<00:03:01.590> much<00:03:01.860> as<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
equipment will last for as much as a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.670 
equipment will last for as much as a
decade<00:03:02.330> sophiana<00:03:03.330> ties<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> expense

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
decade sophiana ties all the expense

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.650 
decade sophiana ties all the expense
over<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.130> amount<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.520> time<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.450> very

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
over that amount of time it's a very

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
over that amount of time it's a very
good<00:03:06.810> investment
