00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.520
 what a pink wave how are they and that of the cousin 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 blue and good but I'm very good at this 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.000
 occasion is I have a pretty news 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.040
 important and that rock is not 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
 will allow mod to affect people 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.800
 online on pc 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.849
 rockstar as everyone knows has no 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.220
 no problem with users 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.500
 modify their games and in fact big 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 forum 4 is one of the games that more mod 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.099
 of all types has been seen since its 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.470
 launch but be of great favor 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 25 the thing does not change although rockstar yes 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.700
 that will be aware of the mods that are not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.260
 ruin by big fabbro 5 online now 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.570
 that does not interview the chief designer 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.490
 playability yoma person explained by 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 referring to the mods that since gta 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.030
 online has such a large community and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.040
 so alive your main objective is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 ensure that nothing spoils what is that 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.790
 experience or that has some impact 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.010
 negative in the player community 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.570
 but good the truth is not very clear 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 how far will the limit be for the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.860
 online riots but we will leave 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.650
 I remember that you can do the play 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.770

 they can get them out there but good 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.530
 I remember that of certain 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.179
 they will prohibit what are the modes 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 only those that do not affect the 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.140
 gameplay what the game as 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.789
 they will allow so obviously 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 people have the same fun that I 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.869
