the gym
in<00:01:32.720> fact<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.170> Georgia<00:01:33.619> at<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.640> end<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.970> the

a<00:01:36.859> section<00:01:44.509> at<00:01:45.509> cetera<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.609> cord<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a section at cetera so if the cord is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
a section at cetera so if the cord is
used<00:01:48.319> in<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.500> tune<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.039> see<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.340> four

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
used in the tune if you see the four

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.010 
used in the tune if you see the four
minor<00:01:50.819> chord<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> middle<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> tune

minor chord in the middle of the tune

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.919 
minor chord in the middle of the tune
then<00:01:52.409> obviously<00:01:52.969> it's<00:01:53.969> gonna<00:01:54.209> be<00:01:54.390> appropriate

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
then obviously it's gonna be appropriate

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.349 
then obviously it's gonna be appropriate
to<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.619> same<00:01:55.859> color<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.880> end<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
to use that same color at the end of

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.990 
to use that same color at the end of
your<00:01:57.479> tube<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.950> any<00:02:02.399> cord<00:02:02.729> from

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
your tube so you can use any cord from

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.399 
your tube so you can use any cord from
the<00:02:03.060> F<00:02:03.509> melodic<00:02:04.409> minor<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:05.490> example<00:02:06.140> D<00:02:07.140> half

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the F melodic minor for example D half

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.669 
the F melodic minor for example D half
diminished<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.250> also<00:02:08.610> from<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.239> scale<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
diminished is also from that scale so it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.390 
diminished is also from that scale so it
will<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.549> effect

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
will have the same effect

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.589 
will have the same effect
you<00:02:14.400> obviously<00:02:15.299> heard<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.660> cliche<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:20.599> can

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
you obviously heard this cliche you can

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.890 
you obviously heard this cliche you can
you<00:02:21.690> tell<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> voicings<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> same<00:02:22.769> chord

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you tell the voicings of the same chord

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.890 
you tell the voicings of the same chord
this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.079> also<00:02:25.260> D<00:02:26.099> half<00:02:26.670> diminished<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.690> time

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
this is also D half diminished this time

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:41.199 
this is also D half diminished this time
with<00:02:28.109> a<00:02:28.760> flat<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> base<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.489> use<00:02:39.079> B<00:02:40.079> 13

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
with a flat in the base you can use B 13

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:51.390 
with a flat in the base you can use B 13
sorry<00:02:42.209> B<00:02:42.420> flat<00:02:42.720> 13<00:02:43.139> which<00:02:43.650> also<00:02:43.829> comes

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:09.520
