00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.120
 so get people to another 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.009
 follow clash of plants and yes there was one 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.379
 new update unfortunately it is outdated because 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 it came exactly when I started driving in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 Vacation for a few days but I go completely 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.609
 anyway with you through your people the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.430
 it missed etc so the newest 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.199
 interesting smells first in the air 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
 it now does not and urged 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.940
 keep the units back that is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 but air units and I'm not doing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 already on level 2 I'm something over 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 ask questions 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.250
 very similar now so I know it 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.239
 Not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 children by a bit questioned so 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 maybe you could also do a few 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 Where can I give this here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.969
 I stand apropos here had the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.829
 wall in conversations that must by then 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.879
 that had me in the corner what should 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 I now wrote to honor me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 now it is completely clear then 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 this feeling that we are not very much 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.039
 important to shine on their profile page 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 with the plus symbol as a bookmark 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 so you can watch it later 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.590
 I found interesting when I was earlier 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.970
 had a clear with earlier 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.299
 which did not want to go in but not anymore 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 but that's pretty much it's yes 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 and then in general that's how it is now 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.479
 little year is nice but generally 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.860
 first stop the user interface 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 You can do it differently if you before you 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 Attacks will stop one displayed 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.540
 Everything has that I find that very much 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 practically 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.259
 that's almost you four out of four spells 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
 do you have yours are a bagger king and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.990
 queen 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 Reddy's you have all the troops etc 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.670
 and yes, then a little one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 gameplay improvements and attack 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.520
 Hunt troops does not defend now 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 more so soon no idea 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.540
 A rare mistake was drilling 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 a defense a troop am 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.860
 border of their reached sighted but 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.079
 not totally fire i never had 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.670
 then it seems to have been one 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.799
 then you are right on raw materials i 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.790
 have a lot of dark elixir and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.670
 Developments if I do that directly 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 namely, for the golem 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.009
 level 2 and currently i am working a lot there 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.900
 I was a surfer in time 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.209
 did not do so much glock 1 in 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.650
 things collected so yes as says 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.510
 Please give a few tips for the air 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.489
 mistake that we are very very very nice 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.409
 would be able to do small things here again 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.540
 yes go to the last time or do 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.049
 He was not that interesting to me 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.519
 I think I had to stop there 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.049
 but two stars if i am not 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.220
 it starts so a bit crazy now 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.659
 Of course, that's something 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.409
 i would like to spend a few alex years 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:44.489
 I think he'll take me too 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.049
 Strong on the superior if I possibly the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.000
 liga stop including stinks and I 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.030
 may want to go back to gold 2 again 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.280
 because I believe that much more pleasant 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.510
 to the pharma so you could yes 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.569
 say your opinion where you best 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.319
 has fallen circle at crystal 21 is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.090
 of course the lucullus strong but im 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.530
 concert more often before that I stop 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.230
 really upset things lose what 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.879
 someone until my change comes 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.980
 as it would be very nice if you were there 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:18.569
 somehow if you write me there 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.359
 what he thinks is the best elo 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.260
 I'll say something lying down to drive 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.940
 look to see if I now do 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.949
 here to use 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.770
 I think they can always be good here 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.730
 use 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.390
 another matter what 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.070
 I have many goals 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.720
 well a little bit upset or 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.720
 did not like some already more 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.940
 So I do with short attacking 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.660
 Then we'll talk about it 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.160
 I want that here everything is still well 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.420
 actually others on the dark location 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:55.580
 in any case magician attack the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:57.810
 unfortunately only the two clean up there 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.370
 pick something relevant yes a few 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:11.190
 coins but I think I'll get ahead 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:13.470
 or very much a lot of text peace 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.710
 we'll be back with it again 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.730
 At a higher level I think about what I am 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.830
 should do next 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.720
 either i can do this here now 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.920
 conspicuous 10 or me my goal and 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.890
 yes highly them and I simply 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.510
 not you sometimes need look soon 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.520
 I have just done everything with Anixe 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.270
 and I just found the walls 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.400
 level 19 with alexia well so topic 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.660
 have been upset or over it 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.370
 really many if one 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.870
 second ignored but quite a few have 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.130
 get excited about that we 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 want to dictate to you what to 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.930
 So the thing that matters is that 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.440
 the clear yes in the end 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.240
 ragged heaps it 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.890
 meanwhile we are reasonably in 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.920
 order but you can see here in the war 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.560
 We always lure through us 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.610
 lose yes or yes it will be better if 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.090
 you can see we have clearly 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.010
 more 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.900
 You can tell that it is yes you ever noticed 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.400
 you see a lot lost but it 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.020
 is here much better so that is 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.580
 we win more but still in 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:15.480
 ragtag bunch and did 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.460
 not doing everything as well as it does 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.960
 it should be that one has one there 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.970
 a few follow these guidelines as well 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.130
 At the same time for me too, I am here 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.360
 now star of Mainz or spoon 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.280
 Not so, but because I hold everything like that 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.020
 necessary I just did not attack that 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.430
 Of course that sometimes means attack 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.690
 not as much 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.790
 and that's why I can not now 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.920
 these super strategies open because of that 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.020
 is it helpful to know what you are 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.700
 So should make of demir and the 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.280
 Penalties are not directly from the court 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.410
 and so what he is the thing one is 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:53.070
 yes, how many attacks there were 1000 that 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.960
 are all gone and yes it would be just you 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.220
 would succeed with such a tactic 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.480
 already water well and it is so 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.000
 That's the best, then there's yes 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.250
 no I find what there is yes if 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.480
 christa done and even did 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.070
 again written the comment 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.660
 then there are possibilities could also 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.110
 not that or what makes you feel better 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.810
 like 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.490
 but to have four sparkling cleans 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.230
 example is shit that is because I completely 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.270
 it used to be good for an air defense 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.260
 Bombing away with the 3 and which 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.300
 to get on better 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.410
 at that time okay but now something 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.670
 bring the four lightning 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.490
 nothing of which he so so so as 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.390
 smaller there yes it makes sense already 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
 have to deal with it 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.200
 yes I have always been reluctant 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.790
 if i'm here on level 10 very much because 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.790
 course level 10 you know what then 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.930
 happened here iron fist is a 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.270
 level 2 already tempting but well because 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.190
 that's really tough here so that 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.970
 upgrade then it's nice what is coming 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.520
 next 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.450
 for the first time in three hours four hours 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.970
 strictly speaking and then with this one 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.810
 pulled up 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.160
 then I also wanted soon 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.020
 start everything a bomb easy 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.820
 I can actually make it higher 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.380
 already the beginning I would have to say 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.420
 giant bomb I have on level 3 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.060
 made 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.730
 they 're all level 3 right now 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.990
 which are missing so that even the 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.000
 software is heard twice the 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.150
 now made high again 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.500
 So that's what it actually was 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.600
 I hope you like it now 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.650
 that else determines my opinion and on 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.720
 Help writes the comments 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.280
 which league thinks better already 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.100
 little drop crystal direction 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.000
 even once , but yes, so I think so 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:36.150
 my experience there has really gold 2 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.800
 so gold 2 I was actually on 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.560
 Of course, most satisfied is something 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:45.080
 10,000 So is not worth or 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.080
 8000 does not itch anyone but 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.780
 but there was a lot to catch up with 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.620
 200,000 200,000 sowas well ok then see 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.620
 Let us be typical again
