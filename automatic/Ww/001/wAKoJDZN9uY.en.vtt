00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
probably see by now and it's more of a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
probably see by now and it's more of a
action<00:00:21.119> based<00:00:21.390> fighting<00:00:22.199> game<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> would<00:00:22.590> say

Bulbasaur piggie squirtle and you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090 
Bulbasaur piggie squirtle and you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
probably guessed the last one Charmander
who<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.289> now<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.440> game<00:00:55.620> was

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
who is up here now this game was

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
released on May 30th it is June 4th now

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.729 
released on May 30th it is June 4th now
for<00:00:59.070> reference<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> again<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> very

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
for reference so it is again a very

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579 
for reference so it is again a very
early<00:01:02.100> alpha<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.750> showing<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
early alpha but I'm showing you this

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
early alpha but I'm showing you this
because<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> combat

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
because I really really like the combat

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.490 
because I really really like the combat
system<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.189> if<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.549> game<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.119> developed<00:01:09.500> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
system and if this game is developed it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
system and if this game is developed it
will<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.130> very<00:01:11.310> good<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> terms<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
will be I think very good in terms of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.859 
will be I think very good in terms of
gameplay<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.530> I'll<00:01:14.369> show<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.700> click<00:01:15.630> one

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
gameplay so I'll show you just click one

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.890 
gameplay so I'll show you just click one
with<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> pokeball<00:01:17.030> catch<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.659> caught

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
with the pokeball catch it and we caught

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.289 
with the pokeball catch it and we caught
it<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.280> tab<00:01:23.880> 2<00:01:24.780> holidays<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it and then tab 2 holidays and it just

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.310 
it and then tab 2 holidays and it just
follows<00:01:27.659> us<00:01:28.790> with<00:01:29.790> its<00:01:29.970> arms<00:01:30.390> flailing<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
follows us with its arms flailing in the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.520 
follows us with its arms flailing in the
air

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
air

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.770 
air
so<00:01:34.400> we<00:01:34.520> head<00:01:34.670> around<00:01:34.940> here<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.630> rest

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
so we head around here this is the rest

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.670 
so we head around here this is the rest
of<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.990> map<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:37.130> much<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:39.260> he<00:01:39.440> jump

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
of the map not much to it can he jump

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.140 
of the map not much to it can he jump
down<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.070> course<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.550> can

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
down of course he can

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.940 
down of course he can
so<00:01:41.990> we'll<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:42.260> probably<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.620> jump<00:01:42.830> down

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
so we'll just probably just jump down

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.760 
so we'll just probably just jump down
here<00:01:43.190> there<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:43.670> go<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.380> don't<00:01:45.380> really<00:01:45.530> want<00:01:45.710> to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
here there we go I don't really want to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.219 
here there we go I don't really want to
fight<00:01:45.920> squirtle<00:01:46.400> because<00:01:47.050> Charmander<00:01:48.050> will

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
fight squirtle because Charmander will

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
fight squirtle because Charmander will
never<00:01:48.440> be<00:01:48.650> able<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.040> squirtle<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:49.810> we'll

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
never be able to be a squirtle so we'll

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.990 
never be able to be a squirtle so we'll
skip<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.770> go<00:01:52.250> fight<00:01:52.729> Pidgey<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.240> guess<00:01:55.000> if

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
skip that and go fight Pidgey I guess if

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.719 
skip that and go fight Pidgey I guess if
he<00:01:56.330> follows<00:01:56.690> me<00:02:00.250> okay<00:02:01.250> then

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
he follows me okay then

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.990 
he follows me okay then
hope<00:02:02.360> work<00:02:02.630> work<00:02:02.860> Charmander<00:02:03.890> oh<00:02:04.070> god<00:02:04.700> what

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
hope work work Charmander oh god what

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.340 
hope work work Charmander oh god what
we're<00:02:05.150> having<00:02:05.420> problems<00:02:05.540> here<00:02:05.840> oh<00:02:06.080> he's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
we're having problems here oh he's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.250 
we're having problems here oh he's
coming<00:02:06.619> okay<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.330> fight<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.020> simply

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
coming okay so to fight all you simply

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.220 
coming okay so to fight all you simply
do<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.560> click<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.330> then<00:02:14.330> you're<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.989> total

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
do is click and then you're in total

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
do is click and then you're in total
control<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.800> Pokemon<00:02:16.250> which<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.760> awesome

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
control of the Pokemon which is awesome

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.660 
control of the Pokemon which is awesome
so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.200> think<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.100> where<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.370> game<00:02:19.550> is

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so I think this is where this game is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.420 
so I think this is where this game is
gonna<00:02:19.820> shine<00:02:20.060> because<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.620> every

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
gonna shine because you know it every

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.130 
gonna shine because you know it every
other<00:02:22.550> games<00:02:22.850> been<00:02:23.060> such<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> grind<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.930> fight

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320
