 You can see there the button 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.359
 from the menu or press the menu button a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.489
 they appear naked 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.489
 You saw that the letting light came on. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 again ignited nothing decreases the test 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.989
 such as turning the television off by 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 Remote button to turn off and seeing here in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.140
 oled defended 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 but the TV remains on volume 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.739
 Let's increase the volume. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.560
 the volume bar does not appear 90 lights 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.680
 O flashing there can speak 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:25.350
 escou blinked but no command happens 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:25.350
 It does not respond again - surge 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.929
 anything 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.979
 the red light selling tv led not 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.979
 answer the command 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:43.950
 the smart tv does not pull the finger on the button 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.950
 smart tv button on smart tv button nothing 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.000
 the television does not respond 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 a new tv I have to a little more 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.700
 two weeks of use three weeks of use 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.039
 it was not cheap although the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:13.280
 promotion was not cheap and we have to 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.700
 get past these annoyances here 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.240
 and I wonder a new tv in these 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.910
 new conditions occurring this kind of 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 How long will a TV last? 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.700
 10 that assures me that I will stay with 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.600
 this TV a year 23 years without having bigger 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 problems with her because that's why I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.110
 I can use my tv again. 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.840
 I have to turn it off or on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.030
 is an abrupt interruption of energy 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.300
 that can cause or know a burn to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.610
 TV board burn components of the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.670
 TV 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.930
 I can with this it is reducing the life 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:04.790
 of my television because of the bad 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.580
 and I want to register 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.940
 which is not an isolated case is not my 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.830
 television is not an exclusive problem 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.760
 my on the internet on the http forum on youtube 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.910
 you will find is countless 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.810
 consumers reporting the same problem 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.549
 with this series of philips televisions 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.340
 to pfl 5007 both the 42 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.620
 inches as the 32 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.820
 inches 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:44.120
 mine is 42 inches this does not want 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.320
 say nothing at all, only referring to what is the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.280
 problem itself 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:54.310
 The problem is given by the philips that 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.150
 placed on the market a television set 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.209
 It presents malfunction 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.390
 illy consumers with false 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.939
 updates that do nothing to improve 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.310
 TV performance 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.730
 I have the last update installed 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.430
 here and even after the last update 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.410
 if again you are constant you will 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.449
 see how much he played with you 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.100
 the led light is blinking because I 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.100
 I'm giving commands on the remote 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.720
 a menu nothing happens i'll have to me 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.229
 the TV on and off. 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.229
 power plug 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.879
 off in making 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.879
 I called again 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.680
 Let's see the ball. 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.430
 now I'm going to work 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.390
 But I ask until when I'm going to have to 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.300
 to be passing through a television 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.040
 expensive 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.010
 I paid that it should work. 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.320
 correctly and the only excuse that 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.170
 philips tem's is to take the 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.700
 TV to a technical assistance 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.040
 new televisions that have just come out of 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.770
 factory must not be taken to the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.210
 technical assistance they should be 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.970
 presenting their functions correctly 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.250
 should function normally 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.490
 You do not have to pick up a TV that 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.620
 It came from the store and took the this technique 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.850
 you take when you already have a use time 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.040
 wear 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:06.190
 bad misuse does not take new appliances 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.830
 for technical science to the factory that the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.590
 produced has to have this awareness of 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.830
 that she made a poor product 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.280
 that the consumer is paying the price is 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.280
 that
