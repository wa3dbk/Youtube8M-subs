going to be on the slower side so it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.280 
going to be on the slower side so it
started<00:02:30.609> establishing<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:32.049> is<00:02:32.139> the

it end up being one you know yeah

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.220 
it end up being one you know yeah
probably<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.329> don't<00:03:10.719> think<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.019> were<00:03:11.139> just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
probably I I don't think they were just

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.689 
probably I I don't think they were just
show<00:03:11.379> us<00:03:11.469> a<00:03:11.530> random<00:03:11.919> person<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.519> ah

show us a random person and be like ah

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.240 
show us a random person and be like ah
it's<00:03:13.480> pretend<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.139> walker<00:03:14.379> something

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
it's pretend it's a walker something

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.530 
it's pretend it's a walker something
like<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.669> I'm<00:03:15.849> betting<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.239> will<00:03:16.359> be<00:03:16.510> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
like that I'm betting it will be a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.719 
like that I'm betting it will be a
walker<00:03:16.780> an<00:03:17.049> early<00:03:17.470> early<00:03:17.829> stage<00:03:18.069> it<00:03:18.340> probably

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
walker an early early stage it probably

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:19.979 
walker an early early stage it probably
isn't<00:03:18.879> very<00:03:19.030> bloody<00:03:19.449> or<00:03:19.599> anything<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:19.870> that

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
isn't very bloody or anything like that

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.289 
isn't very bloody or anything like that
it<00:03:20.290> might<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.590> died<00:03:21.040> are<00:03:21.340> he<00:03:22.090> or<00:03:22.180> she

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
it might have just died are he or she

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.339 
it might have just died are he or she
might<00:03:22.329> have<00:03:22.569> just<00:03:22.629> died<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.139> could<00:03:23.319> just

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
might have just died and I could just

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.740 
might have just died and I could just
look<00:03:23.620> still<00:03:24.069> pretty<00:03:24.400> human<00:03:24.699> pretty<00:03:25.000> human<00:03:25.599> for

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
look still pretty human pretty human for

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.499 
look still pretty human pretty human for
the<00:03:25.810> most<00:03:25.959> were<00:03:26.079> pretty<00:03:26.290> still<00:03:26.949> pretty<00:03:27.129> alive

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:27.509 
the most were pretty still pretty alive

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.670 
the most were pretty still pretty alive
and<00:03:28.509> I<00:03:28.599> doubt<00:03:28.810> they're<00:03:28.959> gonna<00:03:29.019> think<00:03:29.319> much<00:03:29.650> of

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
and I doubt they're gonna think much of

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.199 
and I doubt they're gonna think much of
it<00:03:29.859> they<00:03:30.040> probably<00:03:30.280> are<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.669> to<00:03:30.759> see<00:03:31.060> it

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
it they probably are going to see it

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.879 
it they probably are going to see it
just<00:03:31.810> kind<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.019> walking<00:03:32.290> there<00:03:32.620> they're<00:03:32.769> going

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
just kind of walking there they're going

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.589 
just kind of walking there they're going
to<00:03:32.949> drive<00:03:33.129> by<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.519> we'll<00:03:33.819> find<00:03:34.060> out<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.449> end

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
to drive by and we'll find out the end

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.479
