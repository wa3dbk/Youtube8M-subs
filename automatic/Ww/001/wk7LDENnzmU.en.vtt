00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
let's see what are we getting

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:59.420 
let's see what are we getting
I<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:49.380> believe<00:02:49.709> any<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.100> these<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.400> rose

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:11.010

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.930 

better<00:03:12.020> odds<00:03:12.260> at<00:03:12.470> breeding<00:03:12.830> no<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:13.520> don't<00:03:13.850> need

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
better odds at breeding no I don't need

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.890 
better odds at breeding no I don't need
that<00:03:15.880> well<00:03:16.880> we've<00:03:17.030> gotten<00:03:17.330> three<00:03:17.600> different

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
that well we've gotten three different

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.250 
that well we've gotten three different
dragons<00:03:18.290> every<00:03:18.530> time<00:03:19.390> but<00:03:20.390> none<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.690> them<00:03:20.930> have

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
dragons every time but none of them have

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:31.090 
dragons every time but none of them have
been<00:03:21.850> The<00:03:24.970> Rose<00:03:25.970> dragon<00:03:26.510> come<00:03:27.440> on<00:03:27.590> now<00:03:30.100> this

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.220 

mmm<00:03:44.550> mmm<00:03:45.550> looks<00:03:46.300> like<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.600> got<00:03:46.750> four<00:03:47.080> different

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
so for different types of dragons that's

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.630 
so for different types of dragons that's
I<00:04:13.170> don't<00:04:14.170> know<00:04:14.310> let's<00:04:15.310> see

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
I don't know let's see

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:24.770 
I don't know let's see
hopefully<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.090> got<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.330> here

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.770 

and<00:04:25.710> look<00:04:26.130> at<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.460> new<00:04:27.090> breeding<00:04:27.360> islet

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and look at the new breeding islet

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.650 
and look at the new breeding islet
you're<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.460> design<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.880> breeding

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
you're like the design of the breeding

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.130 
you're like the design of the breeding
Island<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.230> has<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> bunch<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:32.060> roses<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.270> so

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.880 
Island it has a bunch of roses and so
that<00:04:34.350> means<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.650> should<00:04:34.680> get<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.950> rose<00:04:35.130> right<00:04:35.400> I

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890
