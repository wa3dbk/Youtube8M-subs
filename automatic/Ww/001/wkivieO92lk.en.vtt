okay<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> think<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.930> best<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> show<00:00:49.800> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
okay I think the best way is to show you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.310 
okay I think the best way is to show you
it's<00:00:50.400> hard<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:50.790> explain<00:00:51.030> okay<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's hard to explain okay what we do is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320 
it's hard to explain okay what we do is
we<00:00:52.590> start<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> translucent<00:00:53.730> material

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
we start with a translucent material

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.020 
we start with a translucent material
like<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.010> semi-translucent<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.760> very

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
like this semi-translucent but it's very

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
like this semi-translucent but it's very
durable<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.840> should<00:00:58.050> last<00:00:58.200> for<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:59.310> then

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
durable this should last for it and then

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.070 
durable this should last for it and then
we<00:01:00.240> carve<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.260> hope<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.160> yeah<00:01:02.780> cameras<00:01:03.780> can

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we carve it I hope that yeah cameras can

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
we carve it I hope that yeah cameras can
see<00:01:06.800> we<00:01:07.800> saw<00:01:08.009> us<00:01:08.190> it's<00:01:08.880> hard<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> oh<00:01:09.660> oh

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
see we saw us it's hard to see oh oh

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.749 
see we saw us it's hard to see oh oh
there<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.170> nearly<00:01:10.500> technique<00:01:11.190> but<00:01:11.520> when

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
there it is nearly technique but when

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.960 
there it is nearly technique but when
you<00:01:12.110> bring<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> light<00:01:13.860> let's<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.880> if

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you bring it to the light let's see if

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.139 
you bring it to the light let's see if
we<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:16.619> creates<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.399> image<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
we can it creates the image of the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.590 
we can it creates the image of the
actual<00:01:18.570> photograph<00:01:19.290> oh<00:01:19.820> okay<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actual photograph oh okay so it's not so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
actual photograph oh okay so it's not so
much<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.050> autographs<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> photograph

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
much out of autographs not a photograph

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.960 
much out of autographs not a photograph
oh<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.440> go<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:26.399> we<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.580> i<00:01:26.610> wonder<00:01:26.910> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
oh there we go there we go i wonder if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.950 
oh there we go there we go i wonder if
we<00:01:27.060> could<00:01:27.180> dim<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> lights<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.870> studio

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
we could dim the lights in the studio

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
we could dim the lights in the studio
and<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.190> better<00:01:29.430> because

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and you could see a lot better because

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
and you could see a lot better because

did you come up with this idea well I'm
a<00:01:57.090> mechanical<00:01:57.780> engineer<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:58.380> trade<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> i

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
a mechanical engineer by trade and i

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.469 
a mechanical engineer by trade and i
came<00:01:59.640> across<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.630> idea<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> technology

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
came across the idea from the technology

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.140 
came across the idea from the technology
point<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.409> interesting<00:02:05.070> thing<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
point the interesting thing is that this

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.840 
point the interesting thing is that this
concept<00:02:06.720> actually<00:02:06.930> existed<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.979> 1800s

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
concept actually existed in the 1800s

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.910 
concept actually existed in the 1800s
and<00:02:09.060> used<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.780> make<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.440> porcelain

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and used to can make it from porcelain

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.990 
and used to can make it from porcelain
and<00:02:11.390> now<00:02:12.390> i<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.110> ability<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.950> make<00:02:14.340> one

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and now i have the ability to make one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.580 
and now i have the ability to make one
of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> kind<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.870> people<00:02:16.200> send<00:02:16.470> us

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
of the kind so people send us

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.320 
of the kind so people send us
photographs<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.850> these<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
photographs and we make these and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.310 
photographs and we make these and
assemble<00:02:18.780> them<00:02:18.810> into<00:02:19.110> lamps<00:02:19.829> but<00:02:20.459> how<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.820> you

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
assemble them into lamps but how do you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.340 
assemble them into lamps but how do you
carve<00:02:22.320> them<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.829> precisely<00:02:23.489> because<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.450> looks

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
carve them so precisely because it looks

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.949 
carve them so precisely because it looks
like<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.519> picture<00:02:26.670> yeah<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.239> did<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.720> do

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
like it's a picture yeah how did you do

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.460 
like it's a picture yeah how did you do
that<00:02:28.019> off<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.579> that<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:31.290> just

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that off so you can see that it's just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.729 
that off so you can see that it's just
the<00:02:31.709> carved<00:02:32.130> o<00:02:32.959> carving<00:02:33.959> oh<00:02:34.140> there's<00:02:34.590> no

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
the carved o carving oh there's no

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.960 
the carved o carving oh there's no
picture<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.430> then

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
picture and then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.590 
picture and then
it's<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.690> combination<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:38.240> handwork<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
it's a combination of handwork and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.330 
it's a combination of handwork and
computer<00:02:40.580> mill<00:02:41.580> computer<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.570> how<00:02:43.020> how<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.190> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
computer mill computer so how how is it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.840 
computer mill computer so how how is it
actually<00:02:44.580> creating<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.850> different

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
actually creating this this is different

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.170 
actually creating this this is different
width<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.810> material<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.040> more<00:02:50.310> light<00:02:50.730> comes

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
width of material the more light comes

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.510 
width of material the more light comes
through<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.960> lighter<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.500> area<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:52.980> so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
through the lighter the area it is so

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.220 
through the lighter the area it is so
it's<00:02:53.670> playing<00:02:54.030> with<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.450> width<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
it's playing with the width of the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.430 
it's playing with the width of the
material<00:02:55.740> basically<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.630> two<00:02:57.840> faces

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
material basically so you just two faces

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.880 
material basically so you just two faces
or<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.640> anything<00:03:00.410> anything<00:03:01.410> anything

offensive I the larger there are
obviously<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.030> bigger<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.570> an

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
obviously the bigger this is an

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.759 
obviously the bigger this is an
eight-by-ten<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.800> 239<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:52.590> is

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
eight-by-ten and that's 239 and this is

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.570 
eight-by-ten and that's 239 and this is
a<00:03:52.800> five<00:03:53.160> by<00:03:53.430> seven<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:54.180> 159<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.950> compact

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
a five by seven it's 159 this compact

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.229 
a five by seven it's 159 this compact
one<00:03:56.940> here<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.660> 89<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.920> that's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.310> tabletop<00:03:59.790> lamp

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
one here is 89 so that's a tabletop lamp

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
one here is 89 so that's a tabletop lamp
and<00:04:00.450> it's<00:04:00.630> very<00:04:00.959> affordable<00:04:01.680> how<00:04:02.220> much<00:04:02.430> or<00:04:02.730> how

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
and it's very affordable how much or how

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.610 
and it's very affordable how much or how
long<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.570> should<00:04:03.600> say<00:04:03.930> does<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.230> take<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.440> make

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
long I should say does it take to make

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.280 
long I should say does it take to make
one<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.190> these<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:06.360> depends<00:04:06.840> on<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.019> size

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
one of these it depends on this size

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.990 
one of these it depends on this size
this<00:04:07.650> takes<00:04:09.049> just<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.620> carving<00:04:11.250> takes<00:04:11.760> a

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
this takes just the the carving takes a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.020 
this takes just the the carving takes a
few<00:04:12.269> hours<00:04:12.330> okay<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.500> there's<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.010> lot<00:04:14.250> before

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
few hours okay and there's a lot before
