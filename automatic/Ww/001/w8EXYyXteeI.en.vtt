second accord I just wanted to show a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.500 
second accord I just wanted to show a
quick<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.819> showing<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:07.429> poetic<00:00:08.429> case<00:00:08.639> for

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
quick video showing the poetic case for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.160 
quick video showing the poetic case for
the<00:00:09.830> asus<00:00:10.830> transformer<00:00:11.809> this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the asus transformer this is the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.349 
the asus transformer this is the
original<00:00:13.290> transformer<00:00:14.630> and<00:00:16.250> it's<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.460> poet<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
original transformer and it's I poet a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.140 
original transformer and it's I poet a
case<00:00:18.980> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.130> find<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.670> amazon<00:00:21.119> for

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
case you can find this on amazon for

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.269 
case you can find this on amazon for
about<00:00:21.359> 20<00:00:21.689> bucks<00:00:21.949> there's<00:00:22.949> actually<00:00:23.250> three

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
about 20 bucks there's actually three

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
about 20 bucks there's actually three
cases<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.240> very<00:00:24.359> similar<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
cases that are very similar it's the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.339 
cases that are very similar it's the
poetic<00:00:25.970> thereof<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> blur<00:00:27.750> X<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.230> there's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
poetic thereof is the blur X and there's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
poetic thereof is the blur X and there's
also<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.160> case<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.779> much<00:00:30.900> have

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
also be a case they all pretty much have

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.670 
also be a case they all pretty much have
a<00:00:31.529> similar<00:00:31.949> design<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.540> think<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.469> get

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
a similar design so I think if you get

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.700 
a similar design so I think if you get
this<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:39.440> pretty<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this one then pretty much the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.190 
this one then pretty much the
representative<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.170> it's<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
representative of all of them it's a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
representative of all of them it's a
very<00:00:43.410> nice<00:00:43.559> cases<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.280> leather<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
very nice cases it is leather this is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.610 
very nice cases it is leather this is
very<00:00:45.899> nice<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.510> poetic<00:00:48.930> labels

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
very nice you can see the poetic labels

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340 
very nice you can see the poetic labels
look<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
look down here and the one thing the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.840 
look down here and the one thing the
first<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.620> goes<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> bat<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
first thing goes off the bat is is a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
first thing goes off the bat is is a
very<00:00:54.149> thin<00:00:54.600> case<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.010> thin<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
very thin case it's very thin this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
very thin case it's very thin this
doesn't<00:00:56.879> add<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> whole<00:00:57.210> lot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> bulk<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:58.020> all

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
doesn't add a whole lot of bulk at all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.240 
doesn't add a whole lot of bulk at all
to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> transformer<00:00:59.520> makes<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> easy<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> hold

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
to the transformer makes it easy to hold

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
to the transformer makes it easy to hold
this<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.460> does<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.270> cut<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> can

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
this one does have a cut out so you can

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.359 
this one does have a cut out so you can
charge<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:06.619> transformer<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
charge the transformer well as in the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.179 
charge the transformer well as in the
case<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.780> nice<00:01:09.900> feature<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:14.010> has

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
case it's a very nice feature and it has

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.530 
case it's a very nice feature and it has
a<00:01:14.220> nice<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:16.340> latch<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.880> does<00:01:18.119> keep<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
a nice little latch that does keep it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.280 
a nice little latch that does keep it
shut<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.200> camera<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.590> open<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> you've

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
shut the camera is open so you've

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
shut the camera is open so you've
nothing<00:01:22.680> touching<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> camera

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.670 

you<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> screen<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> way<00:01:35.100> expose

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.940 

in<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:42.390> case<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:42.930> use<00:01:43.289> as<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.710> stand

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
in this case can we use as they stand

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.060 
in this case can we use as they stand
and<00:01:44.960> also<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.770> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and also this right here this is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060 
and also this right here this is
actually<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.520> hand<00:01:47.850> strap<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.830> were<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actually a hand strap so if we were to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.940 
actually a hand strap so if we were to
take<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.729> transformer<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:52.830> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
take the transformer and you want me to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.480 
take the transformer and you want me to
hold<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:55.170> stick<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.710> hand<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.460> there

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
hold it you stick your hand in there

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.469 
hold it you stick your hand in there
it's<00:01:57.030> actually<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.450> very<00:01:57.479> nice<00:01:57.869> hand<00:01:58.200> strap

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.680 

it's<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.689> nice<00:02:03.810> feature<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.560> case<00:02:08.690> as

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's a very nice feature of this case as

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.340 
it's a very nice feature of this case as
you<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.049> it<00:02:10.140> doesn't<00:02:10.380> add<00:02:10.530> any<00:02:11.190> bulk<00:02:11.459> at<00:02:11.940> all

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
you see it doesn't add any bulk at all

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.380 
you see it doesn't add any bulk at all
you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.620> lay<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.190> transformer<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.819> when

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you can lay the transformer down when

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.800 
you can lay the transformer down when
it's<00:02:15.510> opening<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> case<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:17.480> tilts<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.599> up

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
it's opening the case it tilts it up

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.750 
it's opening the case it tilts it up
very<00:02:19.500> slightly<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> real<00:02:23.280> function<00:02:23.670> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
very slightly but the real function of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.420 
very slightly but the real function of
this<00:02:23.849> case<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.569> if<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.080> would<00:02:25.920> pop<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this case that if you would pop the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.729 
this case that if you would pop the
bottom<00:02:26.760> zone<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> bottom<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:30.739> can

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
bottom zone of the bottom here you can

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.640 
bottom zone of the bottom here you can
use<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.099> transformer<00:02:32.959> as<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.890> stand<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
use the transformer as a stand and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.060 
use the transformer as a stand and
there's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.739> very<00:02:37.980> nice<00:02:38.220> stand<00:02:39.769> now<00:02:40.769> what<00:02:40.980> is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
there's a very nice stand now what is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.059 
there's a very nice stand now what is
sitting

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.399 

and<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:48.760> innate<00:02:49.060> secure<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.019> not<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.319> to

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
and this innate secure it's not going to

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.000 
and this innate secure it's not going to
fall<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:53.139> is<00:02:53.290> great<00:02:53.439> for<00:02:53.530> watching

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
angles so you can angle it lower long as
