00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
had a pretty big garden out in Fremont

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.590 
had a pretty big garden out in Fremont
so<00:00:23.800> most<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.160> ingredients<00:00:25.760> we<00:00:25.970> had<00:00:26.210> for

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
so most of the ingredients we had for

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.529 
so most of the ingredients we had for
the<00:00:26.690> peanut<00:00:26.960> bit<00:00:27.170> was<00:00:27.440> really<00:00:27.770> fresh<00:00:28.539> but

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
the peanut bit was really fresh but

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.380 
the peanut bit was really fresh but
obviously<00:00:29.900> I'm<00:00:30.230> here<00:00:30.949> in<00:00:31.220> Texas<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:32.270> don't

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
obviously I'm here in Texas and I don't

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.340 
obviously I'm here in Texas and I don't
really<00:00:33.640> have<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.670> garden<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.420> actually<00:00:36.170> when<00:00:36.320> I

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
really have a garden and actually when I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.600 
really have a garden and actually when I
was<00:00:36.500> younger<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:36.890> really<00:00:37.160> didn't<00:00:37.460> like<00:00:37.550> it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
was younger I really didn't like it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.500 
was younger I really didn't like it
because<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.180> was<00:00:38.300> really<00:00:38.449> bitter<00:00:39.970> but<00:00:40.970> now<00:00:41.150> I

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
because it was really bitter but now I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.490 
because it was really bitter but now I
seem<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.170> bitter<00:00:43.010> stuff<00:00:43.400> so<00:00:44.199> here's<00:00:45.199> my

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
seem to like bitter stuff so here's my

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.039 
seem to like bitter stuff so here's my
take<00:00:45.769> on<00:00:46.010> peanut<00:00:46.400> Beth<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.120> low<00:00:47.690> Cano

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
take on peanut Beth this is a low Cano

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:53.320 
take on peanut Beth this is a low Cano
dish<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:50.269> this<00:00:51.049> is<00:00:51.559> my<00:00:51.739> variation<00:00:52.129> on<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.699> there

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
dish so this is my variation on it there

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.410 
dish so this is my variation on it there
are<00:00:53.479> several<00:00:54.019> ways<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.470> make<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.519> think<00:00:55.970> if

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
are several ways to make it I think if

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.750 
are several ways to make it I think if
you<00:00:56.540> wanted<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:56.960> make<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.260> authentic<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.190> most

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
you wanted to make it authentic and most

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.680 
you wanted to make it authentic and most
of<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.030> time<00:00:59.299> when<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.720> do<00:00:59.900> make<00:01:00.140> peanut<00:01:00.559> bet

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
of the time when you do make peanut bet

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.649 
of the time when you do make peanut bet
you<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:02.869> stuff<00:01:03.229> from<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.589> garden

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
you get stuff from the garden

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.600 
you get stuff from the garden
one<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.869> essential<00:01:06.470> ingredients<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
one of the essential ingredients of the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.280 
one of the essential ingredients of the
dish<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.090> your<00:01:08.659> bitter<00:01:09.470> melon<00:01:09.920> over<00:01:10.490> here<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
dish is your bitter melon over here and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.230 
dish is your bitter melon over here and
so<00:01:12.290> this<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> bitter<00:01:12.890> melon<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.000> there

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
so this is the bitter melon and there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.090 
so this is the bitter melon and there
are<00:01:14.329> other<00:01:14.479> parts<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.020> bitter<00:01:15.200> melon<00:01:15.439> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
are other parts of the bitter melon that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.599 
are other parts of the bitter melon that
actually<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.049> have<00:01:18.079> it<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.189> should<00:01:19.219> put

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
actually if you have it you should put

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.399 
actually if you have it you should put
in<00:01:19.759> your<00:01:19.789> peanut<00:01:20.180> bit<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:20.869> like<00:01:21.200> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
in your peanut bit which is like the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.330 
in your peanut bit which is like the
flowers<00:01:22.219> I<00:01:22.549> think<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:24.409> if<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.679> actually<00:01:24.979> grow

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
flowers I think so if you actually grow

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.730 
flowers I think so if you actually grow
bitter<00:01:25.579> melon<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.210> your<00:01:26.359> backyard<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.560> could

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
bitter melon in your backyard you could

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.399 
bitter melon in your backyard you could
put<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.039> flowers<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.119> some<00:01:29.960> some

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
put the flowers and then some some

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.429 
put the flowers and then some some
squash<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.369> don't<00:01:32.119> necessarily<00:01:32.960> think

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
squash here I don't necessarily think

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.919 
squash here I don't necessarily think
this<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:33.979> required<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:34.909> some<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.420> recipes

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
this is required but some of the recipes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.190 
this is required but some of the recipes
I<00:01:36.289> saw<00:01:36.859> on<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> internet<00:01:37.869> actually<00:01:38.869> use

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
I saw on the internet actually use

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.169 
I saw on the internet actually use
squash<00:01:41.020> then<00:01:42.020> there's<00:01:42.200> pork<00:01:42.820> which<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:43.969> put

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
squash then there's pork which I put

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.510 
squash then there's pork which I put
over<00:01:44.299> here<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:44.929> I<00:01:44.990> kind<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.469> tenderized<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.280> um

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
over here and I kind of tenderized it um

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.840 
over here and I kind of tenderized it um
you<00:01:47.210> probably<00:01:47.240> don't<00:01:47.659> need<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:47.990> much<00:01:48.289> pork

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you probably don't need this much pork

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.109 
you probably don't need this much pork
at<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:50.179> but<00:01:50.689> I'm<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:52.069> putting<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.549> in<00:01:52.729> here

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
at all but I'm just putting it in here

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.899 
at all but I'm just putting it in here
and<00:01:53.359> I<00:01:53.539> don't<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.759> could

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
and I don't really think you could

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.169 
and I don't really think you could
probably<00:01:56.090> get<00:01:56.329> away<00:01:56.420> with<00:01:56.539> an<00:01:56.840> eighth<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.380> this

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
probably get away with an eighth of this

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.609 
probably get away with an eighth of this
another<00:01:59.179> thing<00:01:59.299> that<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.749> put<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:01.509> garlic

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
another thing that you put is garlic

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.609 
another thing that you put is garlic
which<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:04.460> some<00:02:04.639> ginger<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
could also put some onions I'm gonna

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.780 
could also put some onions I'm gonna
take<00:02:10.630> okra<00:02:11.630> or<00:02:11.660> ladyfingers<00:02:12.650> kind<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.370> person
