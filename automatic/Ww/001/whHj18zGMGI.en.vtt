00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.170
 have problems 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.090
 but I think so 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 I think that I 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 8 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.160
 but I find this anyway 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.950

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.790
 h 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.790
 recognizable 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.829
 we do not know 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.999
 That 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.589
 but not too 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.649
 with this you can aim a little friend at goal 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.649
