00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.420
 eclairs today we have an unusual release 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.550
 he is dedicated to how to bend the world of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
 warplanes sorting through a lot of stuff i 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.910
 gathered in one video and offer it to you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 to view 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 let 's see what is most important in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 buckwheat n it certainly take care, etc. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.210
 well, actually let me introduce to you 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 several ways to do it 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.779
 The first method is called smeared 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 barrel for its fulfillment we press 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 yaw button to either side and button 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.329
 The roll method is suitable for avoiding more 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.730
 slow opponent next figure 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.980
 called upward spiral we do 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.800
 rise to height during afterburner while 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
 make a smeared barrel in other words 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.329
 we go up from slower 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.910
 an opponent who has less stock 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.289
 afterburner or less speed or it is not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 adapted to altitude combat 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.070
 the next maneuver will help you get away from 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 lower speed fighters 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.969
 dives we perform smeared 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 a barrel heading closer to the ground can 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.250
 at a slight angle you can right at all 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 90 degrees thanks to this maneuver 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.950
 you can not pull down heavy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.780
 fighters 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 it could make out as they lose 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 most of its characteristics with her 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.180
 is on top 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.280
 on this I have with the manners all the rest 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 maneuvers can see in other videos 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.409
 I 'll do a video sometime too 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.930
 for the rest of the maneuver but now it is not 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 about it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.680
 the next thing we need to do is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 configure the mouse and keyboard to do it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.220
 It is necessary because the standard 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.860
 the settings are not at all adapted to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.659
 normal combat in the description to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.119
 video I will provide a link to an article with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.520
 full settings for the mouse 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 and if someone does not want to read it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 use the settings like I have them 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.939
 quite good allows completely 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.490
 control the plane and minimizes 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.480
 the effect of artificial intelligence on himself 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.400
 same plane 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.050
 keyboard settings required 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.150
 set the keys to wrap to the left and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.130
 wrap right the rest of the settings on 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.860
 You can also set your own discretion. 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 such as setting shooting and net of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.920
 guns and purely machine guns it to you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.130
 help more accurately shoot out 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.020
 large-caliber weapons as follows 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.030
 An important point of our conversation will be 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.040
 aircraft selection not every aircraft 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.800
 suitable for some bend for example 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.650
 a cactus of some recent patch patch 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 and so on anyway if you only 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.300
 started the game here is worth thinking about 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 the choice of pumping for the beginner 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.930
 who plays without wine is very important 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.310
 choose a plane and let's now 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.960
 let's see which planes stand out here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.270
 screenshot comparison of characteristics 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.360
 level five planes for myself i 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.230
 chose vaida focke-wolf 190 watts and bf 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.480
 109 years 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.680
 by the totality of characteristics they 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.780
 quite good bf is good 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.720
 average boom buzzer vysotnikami 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.620
 who was loved by many 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.880
 professional players more precisely 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.280
 unprofessional players who 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.540
 top our game let's say a 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.180
 Focke-Wulf has very excellent 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.430
 characteristics a powerful weapon and if its 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 it can be properly applied 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.170
 play hard at the end of the battle on 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.480
 The following screenshot presents 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.489
 plane of the sixth level on myself I 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.580
 singled out four planes you can 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.640
 notice that this is focke-wulf 195 this is bf 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.220
 what's the day frederick is our mustang and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.610
 earring all these planes stand out 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.860
 among the rest of the aircraft at the level they are 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.980
 not bad enough 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.450
 your style of play, choose for yourself 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.520
 more or less suitable 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.099
 it's worth noting that not all airplanes 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.330
 presented in top configuration 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.530
 necessarily in top some 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.050
 missing for example some 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.700
 armament and byte from it does not become 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.739
 for example, is it more maneuverable ? 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.260
 speedy so that strikes even more and 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.480
 characteristics for yourself will say that you 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.010
 you can for example check which plane 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.440
 you are more suitable 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.480
 in this way, go into your 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.849
 progress 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 build planes by winning percentage 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.599
 Well, actually look at what 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 the plane you have the most battles and 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.549
 the highest percentage of victories is this aircraft 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.440
 for you is acceptable you can 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.940
 see the number of frags per battle 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.010
 you can see the quantity 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.690
 damage inflicted for the fight but 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880
 actually decide on which one you 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.830
 it was more comfortable to play redeem it 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.830
 for yourself and leave in the hangar on 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.960
 constant so we chose for ourselves 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.700
 suitable aircraft and the next item 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.310
 our conversation will be the correct game on 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.030
 what does that mean for example you chose 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.130
 on 51 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.160
 and the mustang which is tall and 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.090
 playing from the height and from the passage 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.669
 accordingly you need it so 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.979
 exactly and play if you come down 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.630
 somewhere on the bottom of the sea or enter 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.520
 faith life more agile opponent 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.979
 no good it won't you 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.960
 will bend down and all this I want 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.120
 say this what man wants 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.430
 bend should have head on shoulders 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.160
 he must learn he must look 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.229
 guides reads something on the forum and in 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.910
 Generally evolve because if not 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.560
 head on shoulders no matter how imbalanced 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.520
 the plane you were not given you will still 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.530
 lose 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.740
 the only thing I would like you more 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.370
 ask so this is what you wrote 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.340
 comments about this 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.639
 talk maybe there you write 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.229
 something you are reading a plane for example 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.030
 for yourself feet partnering or something 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.900
 another useful one who will look this 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.820
 guide novice 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.250
 he read your comments and foot 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.260
 will find something interesting on 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.580
 This I have now just been with you all 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.580
 shaken see you soon
