00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
actually goes up it turns down the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.640 
actually goes up it turns down the
brightness<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:13.180> bit<00:04:13.480> making<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.470> some

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
brightness a little bit making it some

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.030 
brightness a little bit making it some
kind<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.340> warm<00:04:15.640> tone<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.120> color<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.079> then

you have an audio quality boost
basically<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.769> smooths<00:04:21.070> out<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.459> frame<00:04:21.910> rates

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
basically it smooths out the frame rates

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.909 
basically it smooths out the frame rates
of<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.450> video<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:23.020> then<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.229> audio<00:04:23.530> as<00:04:23.860> well

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919
