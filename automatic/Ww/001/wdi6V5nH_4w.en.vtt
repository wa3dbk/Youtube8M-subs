00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
I think this may be the end of the

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:27.770 
I think this may be the end of the
chapter

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.890

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
I think so chapter 5 completely lethal

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.379 
I think so chapter 5 completely lethal
