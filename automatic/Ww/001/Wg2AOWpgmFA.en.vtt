00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
experiment of mine to see how well a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.649 
experiment of mine to see how well a
project<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.770> hold<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.460> no<00:01:48.000> finish<00:01:48.479> on

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
project would hold up with no finish on

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.649 
project would hold up with no finish on
it<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> tell<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it and you know I got to tell you it's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899 
it and you know I got to tell you it's
it<00:01:52.079> hasn't<00:01:52.530> fallen<00:01:52.710> apart<00:01:52.950> yet<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it hasn't fallen apart yet I really

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
it hasn't fallen apart yet I really
didn't<00:01:54.180> expect<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.689> last<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.290> long<00:01:55.560> but

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
didn't expect it to last this long but

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.120 
didn't expect it to last this long but
we<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.070> planted<00:01:56.490> new<00:01:56.670> flowers<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
we just planted new flowers in there and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
we just planted new flowers in there and
there's<00:01:59.130> no<00:01:59.369> signs<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.939> rotting<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.810> anything

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there's no signs of rotting or anything

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
there's no signs of rotting or anything
and<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> dirt<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.280> down<00:02:02.719> inside

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and this is just dirt right down inside

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
and this is just dirt right down inside
of<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.960> filling<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.500> filling<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> whole

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
of there filling up filling up the whole

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
of there filling up filling up the whole
thing<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.240> yeah<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.020> know<00:02:07.049> obviously<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.500> don't

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
thing so yeah you know obviously I don't

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.010 
thing so yeah you know obviously I don't
recommend<00:02:08.300> making<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> project<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.989> no

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
recommend making a project with no

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
recommend making a project with no
finish<00:02:10.709> but

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
finish but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.390 
finish but
well<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.510> holding<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.900> fairly<00:02:13.620> well<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.190> now

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
well it's holding up fairly well for now

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.320 
well it's holding up fairly well for now
so<00:02:14.930> take<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.350> sayers<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.980> nae<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
so take that you sayers of nae and the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.800 
so take that you sayers of nae and the
same<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:18.960> these<00:02:20.090> over<00:02:21.090> here

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
same with these over here

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.130 
same with these over here
I<00:02:21.840> made<00:02:22.770> these<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:24.690> glued

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I made these and these are all glued

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.610 
I made these and these are all glued
together<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.850> lap<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:28.140> half<00:02:28.380> lap

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
together with just lap but half lap

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.700 
together with just lap but half lap
joints<00:02:28.650> yeah<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> guess<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.320> dedos

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
joints yeah I guess you know just dedos

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.050 
joints yeah I guess you know just dedos
on<00:02:31.980> those<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.490> they're<00:02:32.610> holding<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:33.030> really

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
on those and they're holding up really

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.300 
on those and they're holding up really
well<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.450> think<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.470> they've<00:02:34.710> been<00:02:34.860> out

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
well I think that and they've been out

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.590 
well I think that and they've been out
here<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> weather<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> whole<00:02:36.270> time<00:02:36.480> but

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
here in the weather the whole time but

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.590 
here in the weather the whole time but
they<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.870> under<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.350> eave<00:02:38.150> right<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.420> so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
they are under this eave right here so

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.300 
they are under this eave right here so
that<00:02:39.780> might<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:42.230> helping<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> out<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> lot<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that might be helping it out a lot and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.860 
that might be helping it out a lot and
this<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.480> also<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.640> polyurethane<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
this one is also the polyurethane on it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.280 
this one is also the polyurethane on it
this<00:02:49.080> part<00:02:49.470> down<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.840> deck<00:02:51.840> stain

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
this part down here is just deck stain

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.140 
this part down here is just deck stain
there's<00:02:52.620> no<00:02:52.800> other<00:02:52.920> finish<00:02:53.340> over<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.850> so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
there's no other finish over that so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.330 
there's no other finish over that so
there<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.080> go<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.410> seems<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.830> pallet

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
there you go it seems like pallet

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.790 
there you go it seems like pallet
projects<00:02:56.820> are<00:02:57.000> all<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.300> rage<00:02:57.480> these<00:02:57.810> days<00:02:57.870> Oh

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
projects are all the rage these days Oh

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.310 
projects are all the rage these days Oh
kind<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.459> glad<00:02:59.700> I'm<00:02:59.880> doing<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.780> can't

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
kind of glad I'm doing these I can't

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.750 
kind of glad I'm doing these I can't
believe<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.650> still<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> bunch<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.340> pallet

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
believe I still have a bunch of pallet

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.490 
believe I still have a bunch of pallet
wood<00:03:02.940> left<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.450> wish<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.720> had<00:03:03.840> counted<00:03:04.230> how<00:03:04.440> many

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
wood left I wish I had counted how many

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.860 
wood left I wish I had counted how many
of<00:03:04.890> those<00:03:05.040> pallets<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:05.940> initially<00:03:06.450> I've

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
of those pallets I got initially I've

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 
of those pallets I got initially I've
only<00:03:06.990> made<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.380> one<00:03:07.560> trip<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.130> free<00:03:08.370> pallets

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
only made that one trip for free pallets

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.090 
only made that one trip for free pallets
I<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> had<00:03:09.959> eight<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.530> them<00:03:10.740> I'm<00:03:10.950> trying

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
I think I had eight of them I'm trying

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100 
I think I had eight of them I'm trying
to<00:03:11.250> imagine<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.910> stacked<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.510> my<00:03:12.660> truck<00:03:12.959> but

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
to imagine that stacked in my truck but

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
to imagine that stacked in my truck but
I<00:03:13.140> still<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> whole<00:03:13.890> bunch<00:03:14.250> left<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:14.850> a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
I still have a whole bunch left so a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.060 
I still have a whole bunch left so a
little<00:03:15.360> bit<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.720> stuff<00:03:16.019> goes<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> long<00:03:16.709> way

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
little bit of that stuff goes a long way

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.479 
little bit of that stuff goes a long way
a<00:03:17.700> couple<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.390> people<00:03:18.650> were<00:03:19.650> saying<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.310> just

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
a couple of people were saying that just

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.860 
a couple of people were saying that just
seems<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.760> lot<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.000> work<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.510> take<00:03:21.690> them

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
seems like a lot of work to take them

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.229 
seems like a lot of work to take them
apart<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> fair<00:03:23.400> amount<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.790> work<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
apart and it is a fair amount of work to

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.420 
apart and it is a fair amount of work to
take<00:03:24.510> apart<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> pallet<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.250> if<00:03:26.340> you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
take apart a pallet but I think if you

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.100 
take apart a pallet but I think if you
just<00:03:26.459> cut<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.239> ends<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:27.870> thing

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
just cut off the ends for one thing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.720 
just cut off the ends for one thing
rather<00:03:28.320> than<00:03:28.590> trying<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.920> pry<00:03:29.220> everything

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
rather than trying to pry everything

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.550 
rather than trying to pry everything
apart<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.239> sure<00:03:30.480> makes<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.959> process<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.530> a

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
apart it sure makes that process go a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.020 
apart it sure makes that process go a
lot<00:03:31.800> quicker<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.459> was<00:03:32.580> looking<00:03:32.760> through<00:03:32.790> some

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
lot quicker I was looking through some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.240 
lot quicker I was looking through some
of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.180> comments<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> past<00:03:34.080> few<00:03:34.290> projects

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
and there's really no comments that I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.080 
and there's really no comments that I
think<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.650> really<00:03:37.680> need<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.040> answer<00:03:38.550> here<00:03:39.060> so

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
it's pretty obvious they're pretty

simple projects I did use the nails from
the<00:03:44.850> pallets<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.840> use<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.800> picture<00:03:47.519> frame

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
I made this past week the only thing I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.930 
I made this past week the only thing I
had<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:49.860> was<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.190> had<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.370> cut<00:03:50.580> them<00:03:50.730> down<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
had to do was I had to cut them down a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.580 
had to do was I had to cut them down a
little<00:03:51.209> bit<00:03:51.450> shorter<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.019> didn't<00:03:52.260> show<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.530> in

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
little bit shorter I didn't show that in

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.410 
little bit shorter I didn't show that in
the<00:03:52.650> video<00:03:52.860> because<00:03:53.040> well<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:53.489> boring<00:03:53.700> but

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the video because well that's boring but

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.699 
the video because well that's boring but
that<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:54.780> kind<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:54.989> neat<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.230> use<00:03:55.350> those<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that was kind of neat to use those and

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.710 
that was kind of neat to use those and
keep<00:03:55.890> them<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.280> rusty<00:03:56.790> maybe<00:03:57.450> they're<00:03:57.600> like

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
keep them that rusty maybe they're like

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.590 
keep them that rusty maybe they're like
pre<00:03:57.959> rusted<00:03:58.470> nails<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.790> good<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.239> did

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
pre rusted nails so that was good I did

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.660 
pre rusted nails so that was good I did
have<00:04:00.780> some<00:04:00.989> people<00:04:01.140> last<00:04:01.739> time<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.100> posted<00:04:02.550> a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
have some people last time I posted a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.940 
have some people last time I posted a
mere<00:04:02.910> minutes<00:04:03.120> which<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.080> probably<00:04:04.470> like

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
mere minutes which was probably like

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.050 
mere minutes which was probably like
ages<00:04:05.459> ago<00:04:06.080> asked<00:04:07.080> me<00:04:07.260> why<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.160> don't<00:04:08.549> use<00:04:08.760> my

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
ages ago asked me why I don't use my

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.420 
ages ago asked me why I don't use my
good<00:04:09.450> camera<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:10.049> these<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.860> well<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.400> just

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
good camera for these and well it's just

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.220 
good camera for these and well it's just
because<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.330> is<00:04:12.450> just<00:04:12.600> way<00:04:12.780> easier<00:04:12.810> I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
because it's this is just way easier I

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.099 
because it's this is just way easier I
still<00:04:13.500> using<00:04:13.769> my<00:04:13.799> camcorder<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.690> used<00:04:15.959> to

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
still using my camcorder that I used to

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.590 
still using my camcorder that I used to
use<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.560> shoot<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.010> dentist<00:04:17.340> easy<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.359> setup

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
use to shoot your dentist easy to setup

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.840 
use to shoot your dentist easy to setup
and<00:04:18.840> quick<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.380> move<00:04:19.560> around<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.370> figured

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
and quick to move around and I figured

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.070 
and quick to move around and I figured
most<00:04:20.940> people<00:04:21.209> are<00:04:21.299> going<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.870> watch

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080

start shooting video on my phone for the
near<00:04:37.590> minutes<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.250> still<00:04:38.610> need<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.880> get<00:04:38.940> a

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
near minutes but I still need to get a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.700 
near minutes but I still need to get a
little<00:04:39.180> holder<00:04:39.540> for<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.840> tripod<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.620> was

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
little holder for my tripod and it was

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.960 
little holder for my tripod and it was
really<00:04:40.890> stupid<00:04:41.100> because<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.760> had<00:04:41.880> an

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
really stupid because I just had an

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.420 
really stupid because I just had an
order<00:04:42.270> out<00:04:42.300> at<00:04:42.600> Amazon<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.320> week<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:44.400> a

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
order out at Amazon this week for a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.490 
order out at Amazon this week for a
couple<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.700> things<00:04:44.850> for<00:04:45.090> my<00:04:45.240> other<00:04:45.540> camera<00:04:45.840> and

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
couple of things for my other camera and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.530 
couple of things for my other camera and
I<00:04:46.560> forgot<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.040> wanted<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.850> put<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.210> there

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
I forgot I wanted to put this in there

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.390 
I forgot I wanted to put this in there
so<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> guess<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.230> just<00:04:49.590> have<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.800> remember<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.250> do

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
so I guess I just have to remember to do

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.890 
so I guess I just have to remember to do
that<00:04:50.550> next<00:04:50.820> time<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.180> did<00:04:51.360> get<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.540> sheet<00:04:51.810> of

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
that next time I did get a sheet of

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.350 
that next time I did get a sheet of
plywood<00:04:52.140> this<00:04:52.710> week<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.580> over<00:04:53.880> here<00:04:54.180> which

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
plywood this week it's over here which

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.640 
plywood this week it's over here which
you<00:04:54.570> can't<00:04:54.810> see<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.110> because<00:04:55.290> I'd<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.620> to

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
you can't see it because I'd have to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.980 
you can't see it because I'd have to
move<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.040> camera<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.730> guess<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.570> could<00:04:57.720> do<00:04:57.870> that

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
move the camera I guess I could do that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.660 
move the camera I guess I could do that
right<00:04:58.050> since<00:04:58.650> it's<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.920> nice<00:04:59.900> see<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.670> have

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
right since it's a nice see that I have

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.910 
right since it's a nice see that I have
to<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:02.940> prove<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.540> it's<00:05:03.720> really<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.380> sheet

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
to like prove that it's really a sheet

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.830 
to like prove that it's really a sheet
of<00:05:05.040> plywood<00:05:05.280> for<00:05:05.730> some<00:05:05.880> reason<00:05:08.510> why<00:05:09.510> did<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.780> get

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
of plywood for some reason why did I get

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.330 
of plywood for some reason why did I get
the<00:05:10.080> sheet<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.380> ply<00:05:10.590> oh<00:05:10.620> because<00:05:11.040> you<00:05:11.250> know

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
around a couple of ideas maybe for some

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.270 
around a couple of ideas maybe for some
serving<00:05:23.910> trays<00:05:24.450> or<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:25.110> serving<00:05:25.530> tray<00:05:25.650> or<00:05:25.980> a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
chips and dip tray I know I've made a

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.690 
chips and dip tray I know I've made a
chips<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.320> dip<00:05:28.470> tray<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.919> long<00:05:29.100> time<00:05:29.340> ago<00:05:29.550> but

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
chips and dip tray a long time ago but

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.670 
chips and dip tray a long time ago but
maybe<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.000> can<00:05:30.090> make<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.390> a<00:05:30.570> different<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:31.350> but

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
maybe I can make it a different one but

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.950 
maybe I can make it a different one but
that<00:05:31.800> doesn't<00:05:32.100> explain<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.580> plywood<00:05:33.030> the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
that doesn't explain the plywood the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.890 
that doesn't explain the plywood the
plywood<00:05:34.500> was<00:05:34.650> for<00:05:35.040> just<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:35.970> small<00:05:36.150> bookcase

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
plywood was for just a small bookcase

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.930 
plywood was for just a small bookcase
that<00:05:37.230> I<00:05:37.260> want<00:05:37.500> to<00:05:37.590> make<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.190> inside<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.790> house

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
that I want to make for inside the house

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.850 
that I want to make for inside the house
where<00:05:39.180> my<00:05:39.270> son<00:05:39.480> keeps<00:05:39.780> all<00:05:39.960> his<00:05:40.169> crap<00:05:40.530> from

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
where my son keeps all his crap from

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.810 
where my son keeps all his crap from
school<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:42.620> piles<00:05:43.620> up<00:05:43.950> all<00:05:44.460> over<00:05:44.490> the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
school that just piles up all over the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.540 
school that just piles up all over the
place<00:05:45.500> organized<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:46.740> my<00:05:46.830> thought<00:05:47.070> was<00:05:47.280> and

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
place organized but my thought was and

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.130 
place organized but my thought was and
I've<00:05:47.640> seen<00:05:47.850> these<00:05:48.000> before<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.540> single<00:05:48.900> sheet

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
I've seen these before the single sheet

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.560 
I've seen these before the single sheet
of<00:05:49.169> plywood<00:05:49.470> projects<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:51.390> I<00:05:51.419> think

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
of plywood projects and so I think

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.680 
of plywood projects and so I think
that's<00:05:51.840> what<00:05:51.960> I'd<00:05:52.050> like<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.260> do<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:52.860> big<00:05:53.130> a

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
that's what I'd like to do is big a

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.400 
that's what I'd like to do is big a
single<00:05:54.690> sheet<00:05:55.400> bookcase<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:57.050> it<00:05:58.050> should<00:05:58.290> be

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
single sheet bookcase and it should be

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.140 
single sheet bookcase and it should be
easy<00:05:58.620> enough<00:05:58.770> will<00:05:59.130> be<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.280> big<00:05:59.520> one<00:05:59.700> but<00:06:00.000> I'd

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
easy enough will be a big one but I'd

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.720 
easy enough will be a big one but I'd
like<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.330> do<00:06:00.510> something<00:06:00.720> nice<00:06:01.110> with<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.590> I<00:06:01.730> what

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
like to do something nice with it I what

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.159 
like to do something nice with it I what
I've<00:06:02.850> got<00:06:03.120> if<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.330> got<00:06:03.480> is<00:06:03.630> what<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:03.930> do<00:06:04.050> with

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
I've got if you got is what to do with

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.010 
I've got if you got is what to do with
the<00:06:04.290> back<00:06:04.530> because<00:06:05.060> 3/4<00:06:06.060> inch<00:06:06.240> plywood<00:06:06.540> for

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
the back because 3/4 inch plywood for

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.750 
the back because 3/4 inch plywood for
the<00:06:07.050> back<00:06:07.350> of<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.710> bookcases<00:06:08.160> is<00:06:08.490> rather

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
the back of a bookcases is rather

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.850 
the back of a bookcases is rather
ridiculous<00:06:09.450> so<00:06:09.930> I<00:06:09.960> think<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.320> may<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:10.620> have<00:06:10.830> a

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
ridiculous so I think it may just have a

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.490 
ridiculous so I think it may just have a
couple<00:06:11.190> of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
couple of

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.980
