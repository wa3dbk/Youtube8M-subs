00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Do you want to marry me? You 're married, I'm married. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 speaking in las vegas those little chapel 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 if you like to do it or until 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 photos and valley 2 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 we put on a challenge that was 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 bring news to the public 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 Brazilian, our premise was 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.050
 find some feature that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 possible extravagance. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740
 big family 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.170
 this brilliant idea that Cursino and the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.030
 saints had to take history and that's 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.460
 a piece of history for las vegas 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.879
 it fell like a glove for everyone to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 People understood that las vegas is this icon. 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.489
 of the place of expenditure of the consul's place 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 I think it could not have been better if 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.829
 What is las vegas for this family? 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.239
 vegas 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.770
 it was a scenario that I always think 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 combined with the personality of the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 tino did not fit perfectly with him 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 because the allegory of hotels is that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 I exaggerate the colors the money earn 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 losing seemed perfect environmental film 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 In Vegas for him, right? 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 besides lots of comedy of much scene 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 fun has lots of action has adventure in 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.009
 a wonderful backdrop 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.590
 they are amazing old as our 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.659
 producer falls and the director talks where you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.970
 Putting on the camera, it 's nice to film the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.000
 the use of las vegas in the project is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.790
 really with a scenario, we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 used the city through a large 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.530
 partnership with the niche of palazzo o 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.950
 hotel enters as a partnership for us 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.200
 and we use all the various areas of the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 luxury hotel in a channel it is venice 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.030
 have the malls have the public casinos 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 desert shoot in the middle of the desert 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.549
 it was a dry absurd heat like a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 wind storm began to overturn the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.490
 whole set on the smoking all show whether it was 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.829
 crazy 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.860
 but the task is a sandstorm 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.290
 in the very funny movie filmed in 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.390
 old for a universe is everyone 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.280
 You know the imagination but I've never seen 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.349
 a Brazilian story taking place there 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 or the stone was a very 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.709
 important big river and it was very 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.810
 fun for us an experience 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.880
 so it will stay in our memory 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.530
 Forever so I think for the whole 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 team of us all 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.489
 It was a lot of fun, nice one. 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.489
 such an odd thing
