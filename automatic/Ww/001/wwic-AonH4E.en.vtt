00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.229 
couldn't see it right there just google
it<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.230> sure<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.679> find<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> ingredients

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
it I'm sure you can find the ingredients

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.639 
it I'm sure you can find the ingredients
but<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> fat<00:00:34.380> burner

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649

but so this is not just a fat burner
it's<00:00:35.040> more<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> three<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> one

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
