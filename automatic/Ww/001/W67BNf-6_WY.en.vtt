00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
way up and just for video sake we'll

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
way up and just for video sake we'll
just<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.309> floor<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> higher

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
just start at the first floor the higher

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
just start at the first floor the higher
you<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.379> obviously<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.280> more<00:00:41.370> difficult

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you go up obviously the more difficult

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.869 
you go up obviously the more difficult
it<00:00:41.910> gets<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.329> 64<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:45.829> top<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it gets but 64 is the the top or the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.299 
it gets but 64 is the the top or the
last<00:00:48.300> number<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.920> last<00:00:50.100> floor

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
last number that you can the last floor

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
last number that you can the last floor
that<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.020> select<00:00:52.500> menu

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that you can get to from the select menu

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.349 
that you can get to from the select menu
here<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.260> our<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.530> guide<00:00:55.739> bevel<00:00:58.340> and

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
here we have our little guide bevel and

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.049 
here we have our little guide bevel and
in<00:01:00.359> each<00:01:00.539> stage<00:01:00.870> there'll<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:02.059> different

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
in each stage there'll be a different

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
in each stage there'll be a different
setup<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.600> far<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.379> items<00:01:05.309> are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
setup as far as like what items are

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
setup as far as like what items are
laying<00:01:05.790> around<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> case<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.530> looks<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
laying around in this case it looks like

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.880 
laying around in this case it looks like
Tetris<00:01:08.100> pieces<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.470> your<00:01:10.470> character<00:01:10.860> can

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
Tetris pieces but your character can

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030 
Tetris pieces but your character can
only<00:01:11.130> turn<00:01:11.400> around<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:12.900> can't<00:01:13.110> jump<00:01:13.350> anything

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
only turn around you can't jump anything

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
only turn around you can't jump anything
like<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.840> watch

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
like that so you have to really watch

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.440 
like that so you have to really watch
where<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> place<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.650> pieces<00:01:17.220> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
where you place your pieces here

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
where you place your pieces here
in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.110> upper<00:01:19.470> left<00:01:19.680> hand<00:01:19.770> corner<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.369> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in the upper left hand corner you can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
in the upper left hand corner you can
see<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.970> power<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.140> slowly<00:01:22.530> goes<00:01:22.830> down

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
see your power and that slowly goes down

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
see your power and that slowly goes down
so<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.750> on

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so you really have to kind of get on

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.219 
so you really have to kind of get on
this<00:01:25.020> stuff<00:01:25.350> quickly<00:01:26.540> there<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> pattern<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this stuff quickly there is a pattern to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.890 
this stuff quickly there is a pattern to
each<00:01:28.290> stage<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.070> once<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> master<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> it's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
each stage and once you master it it's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
each stage and once you master it it's
not<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> big<00:01:31.350> deal<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> wanted

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
not a big deal like for now if I wanted

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
not a big deal like for now if I wanted
to<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.990> vine<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.950> set<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> down

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to go up this vine here if I set it down

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.580 
to go up this vine here if I set it down
there<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.579> can't<00:01:35.880> climb<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> even<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
there I can't climb up it and even if I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.420 
there I can't climb up it and even if I
put<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> other<00:01:38.549> side<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:40.430> in

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
put it here I'm on the other side so in

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
put it here I'm on the other side so in
order<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
order to do this one here I just got to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
order to do this one here I just got to
set<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.729> change

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
set this one here go over this change

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.250 
set this one here go over this change
the<00:01:45.960> direction

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
the direction

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.920 
the direction
and<00:01:47.350> we<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.860> set<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.130> down<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:49.330> we<00:01:49.690> can<00:01:49.720> go

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
and we can set it down and we can go

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.450 
and we can set it down and we can go
through<00:01:50.110> our<00:01:50.140> stage<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.890> some<00:01:54.130> time<00:01:54.340> to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
through our stage I take some time to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.830 
through our stage I take some time to
figure<00:01:54.610> out<00:01:54.730> some<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.090> these<00:01:55.150> secrets<00:01:55.600> for

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
figure out some of these secrets for

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.280 
figure out some of these secrets for
sure<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.340> once<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.640> do<00:01:58.140> you'll<00:01:59.140> be<00:01:59.170> able

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
sure and but once you do you'll be able

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.390 
sure and but once you do you'll be able
to<00:01:59.440> fly<00:01:59.560> through<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> game<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:00.370> quickly

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
to fly through the game really quickly

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.880 
to fly through the game really quickly
them<00:02:01.360> basically<00:02:02.020> supposed<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.500> pick<00:02:02.650> up<00:02:02.740> items

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
them basically supposed to pick up items

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.980 
them basically supposed to pick up items
along<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.490> way<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.630> one<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.900> a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
along the way but here this one is a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.750 
along the way but here this one is a
tricky<00:02:08.380> one<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.040> turn<00:02:09.220> around<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.580> wrong

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
tricky one if you turn around the wrong

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.370 
tricky one if you turn around the wrong
way<00:02:09.940> you'll<00:02:10.240> wind<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:10.540> falling<00:02:10.869> down<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
way you'll wind up falling down in the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.720 
way you'll wind up falling down in the
spikes<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.920> all<00:02:18.040> about<00:02:18.250> choosing<00:02:18.520> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
spikes so it's all about choosing the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.650 
spikes so it's all about choosing the
right<00:02:18.820> block<00:02:19.270> at<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> right<00:02:19.810> time<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:25.510> he

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
right block at the right time and if he

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.070 
right block at the right time and if he
falls<00:02:25.960> too<00:02:26.260> far<00:02:26.560> he<00:02:27.100> will<00:02:27.250> die<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.510> that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
falls too far he will die so and that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.390 
falls too far he will die so and that
also<00:02:29.260> depends<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.890> stage<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:33.130> might<00:02:33.370> not

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
also depends on the stage this might not

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.170 
also depends on the stage this might not
be<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.700> very<00:02:33.760> long<00:02:34.150> video<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.690> me<00:02:34.810> -<00:02:39.180> what's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
interesting it's made by NAMM cut or

00:02:43.050 --> 00:03:14.940 
interesting it's made by NAMM cut or
Namco<00:02:44.050> as<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.320> all<00:02:44.440> know<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> now

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
no they just just screwed myself out of

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:29.230 
no they just just screwed myself out of
a<00:03:20.300> way<00:03:21.080> out<00:03:22.510> yeah<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:25.540> can't<00:03:26.950> ya<00:03:28.150> can't<00:03:29.150> do

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.280 

yeah<00:03:37.760> there's<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.540> basically<00:03:38.870> no<00:03:39.050> choice

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
yeah there's kind of basically no choice

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.890 
yeah there's kind of basically no choice
when<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.280> mess<00:03:40.640> up<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:41.000> kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.300> either<00:03:41.660> have

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
when you mess up you kind of either have

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.880 
when you mess up you kind of either have
to<00:03:42.190> kill<00:03:43.190> your<00:03:43.340> character<00:03:43.520> off<00:03:43.910> or<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.720> know

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
to kill your character off or you know

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:56.600 
to kill your character off or you know
wait<00:03:45.890> for<00:03:45.920> your<00:03:46.280> health<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.820> go<00:03:47.000> down<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.450> die

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.490 

you<00:03:57.610> can't<00:03:57.880> climb<00:03:58.240> with<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.960> stuff<00:03:59.170> well

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
you can't climb with this stuff well

you can't climb with this stuff well
unfortunately<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.270> could<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.690> would<00:04:01.780> be

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
unfortunately if you could that would be

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:16.289 
unfortunately if you could that would be
very<00:04:03.190> helpful<00:04:14.400> basically<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.730> need<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.120> do

very helpful basically what I need to do
is<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.900> need<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.109> get<00:04:17.410> that<00:04:17.709> piece<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:28.140> don't

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
is I need to get that piece I don't

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:46.409 
is I need to get that piece I don't
think<00:04:29.350> I'm<00:04:29.440> gonna<00:04:29.530> make<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:29.920> one<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:45.419> don't

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
think I'm gonna make this one I don't

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.720 
think I'm gonna make this one I don't
think<00:04:46.660> it's<00:04:46.780> gonna<00:04:46.930> work<00:04:47.020> out<00:04:47.400> yeah

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
think it's gonna work out yeah

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.970 
think it's gonna work out yeah
I've<00:04:48.970> already<00:04:49.090> confused<00:04:49.570> myself<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.680> your

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
I've already confused myself and your

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.890 
I've already confused myself and your
guys<00:04:51.100> gonna<00:04:51.280> start<00:04:51.550> flashing<00:04:51.790> once<00:04:52.570> instead

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
guys gonna start flashing once instead

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.580 
guys gonna start flashing once instead
splashing<00:04:53.410> then<00:04:53.890> he's<00:04:54.010> dead

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
splashing then he's dead

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.930 
splashing then he's dead
but<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.620> think<00:04:56.890> you<00:04:57.130> can<00:04:57.250> get<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.460> general<00:04:57.730> idea

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
but I think you can get the general idea

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.120 
but I think you can get the general idea
the<00:04:58.390> game<00:04:58.570> like<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.140> said<00:04:59.350> it's<00:04:59.830> not<00:04:59.950> something

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
the game like I said it's not something

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.860 
the game like I said it's not something
that<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.520> can<00:05:00.669> just<00:05:00.850> pick<00:05:01.060> up<00:05:01.240> usually<00:05:01.720> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
that you can just pick up usually and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.150 
that you can just pick up usually and
figure<00:05:02.140> out<00:05:02.200> unless<00:05:02.560> you're<00:05:02.770> really<00:05:03.010> really

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
figure out unless you're really really

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.670 
figure out unless you're really really
good<00:05:03.460> with<00:05:03.610> puzzle<00:05:03.940> games<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.810> mean<00:05:05.290> if<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.530> are

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
good with puzzle games I mean if you are

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.530 
good with puzzle games I mean if you are
then<00:05:05.919> yeah<00:05:06.400> I'm<00:05:06.520> sure<00:05:06.700> that<00:05:06.730> you<00:05:07.000> could<00:05:07.150> figure

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
then yeah I'm sure that you could figure

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.110 
then yeah I'm sure that you could figure
this<00:05:07.750> stuff<00:05:07.870> out<00:05:08.080> pretty<00:05:08.320> quickly<00:05:08.590> but<00:05:09.120> in

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
this stuff out pretty quickly but in

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.550 
this stuff out pretty quickly but in
general<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.750> think<00:05:10.780> it's<00:05:11.020> pretty<00:05:11.260> challenging

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
general I think it's pretty challenging

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.070 
general I think it's pretty challenging
game<00:05:12.040> it<00:05:12.970> takes<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.300> little<00:05:13.720> bit<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:13.960> getting

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
game it takes a little bit of getting

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.950 
game it takes a little bit of getting
used<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.530> in<00:05:14.710> order<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:15.040> get<00:05:15.190> through<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.550> and

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
used to in order to get through it and

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.810 
used to in order to get through it and
but<00:05:16.960> once<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.200> figure<00:05:17.440> out<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.710> patterns<00:05:18.070> the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
but once you figure out the patterns the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.960 
but once you figure out the patterns the
different<00:05:19.680> stages<00:05:20.680> you'll<00:05:21.490> be<00:05:21.580> able<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.820> fly

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
different stages you'll be able to fly

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.659 
different stages you'll be able to fly
through<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.270> pretty<00:05:22.419> quickly

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
through it pretty quickly

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:35.450 
through it pretty quickly
I<00:05:32.960> really<00:05:33.960> want<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.319> turn<00:05:34.529> this<00:05:34.889> one<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.310> other

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
I really want to turn this one the other

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.519 
I really want to turn this one the other
way<00:05:41.240> problem<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.360> as<00:05:42.599> soon<00:05:42.659> as<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.020> lay<00:05:43.169> that<00:05:43.199> one

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
way problem is as soon as I lay that one

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:53.959 
way problem is as soon as I lay that one
down<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:44.460> gonna<00:05:44.610> be<00:05:44.789> game<00:05:45.180> whore<00:05:52.969> that's

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
down it's gonna be game whore that's

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:54.950 
down it's gonna be game whore that's
what<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.150> should<00:05:54.419> have<00:05:54.449> done<00:05:54.599> I<00:05:54.659> should<00:05:54.779> have

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
what I should have done I should have

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.959 
what I should have done I should have
leave<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.229> one<00:05:55.379> down<00:05:55.499> no<00:05:55.889> I<00:05:58.639> think<00:05:59.639> I<00:05:59.819> figured

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
leave that one down no I think I figured

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:23.710 
leave that one down no I think I figured
it<00:06:00.150> out<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.479> last<00:06:00.629> minute

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.260 

there<00:06:24.720> we<00:06:25.050> go<00:06:25.229> that's<00:06:26.129> a<00:06:26.310> little<00:06:26.340> better

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.570 

yeah<00:06:33.349> after<00:06:34.349> you<00:06:34.889> know<00:06:34.979> a<00:06:35.009> few<00:06:35.250> attempts<00:06:35.520> of

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
yeah after you know a few attempts of

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.140 
yeah after you know a few attempts of
dying<00:06:35.789> finally<00:06:36.599> figure<00:06:36.810> it<00:06:36.900> out<00:06:37.669> but<00:06:38.669> I<00:06:38.940> think

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
dying finally figure it out but I think

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.790 
dying finally figure it out but I think
that's<00:06:39.270> probably<00:06:39.419> you<00:06:39.960> know<00:06:40.080> long<00:06:40.379> enough<00:06:40.620> to

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
that's probably you know long enough to

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.980 
that's probably you know long enough to
give<00:06:41.400> you<00:06:41.460> a<00:06:41.550> general<00:06:41.940> idea<00:06:42.060> what<00:06:42.629> babble

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
give you a general idea what babble

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.499 
give you a general idea what babble

looks like and yeah like I said if

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.029

fan of you know some of the older puzzle
games<00:06:50.610> things<00:06:51.360> like<00:06:51.569> this<00:06:51.810> where<00:06:52.379> you<00:06:52.500> have<00:06:52.650> to

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
games things like this where you have to

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.309 
games things like this where you have to
think<00:06:53.430> about<00:06:53.669> the<00:06:53.849> stage<00:06:54.090> and<00:06:54.419> try<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.020> you

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
think about the stage and try and you

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.050 
think about the stage and try and you
know<00:06:55.349> move<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:55.770> blocks<00:06:56.009> you're<00:06:56.669> on<00:06:56.759> a<00:06:56.789> time

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.249 
know move the blocks you're on a time
limit<00:06:57.240> so<00:06:57.509> there's<00:06:57.659> a<00:06:57.719> lot<00:06:57.840> of<00:06:57.930> pressure<00:06:58.139> to

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
limit so there's a lot of pressure to

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.839 
limit so there's a lot of pressure to
the<00:06:58.440> game<00:06:58.590> if<00:06:59.039> you<00:06:59.099> like<00:06:59.250> those<00:06:59.430> kind<00:06:59.699> of<00:06:59.729> games
