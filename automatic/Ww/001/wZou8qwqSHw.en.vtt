00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.340
 hello people and welcome still 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.290
 times call for a decision set 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.430
 wants and recently the video 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.080
 made where he could decide as 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.990
 between intro 1 2 or 3 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.599
 and the third intro will be very often 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.210
 chosen and thus difficult is only now 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.590
 already written down so that the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.929
 Music is not so good to the metro 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.970
 fits or not nice and that's why 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.769
 I wanted to ask you again which 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.759
 music because it is best I found it 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.800
 Nice that back in the comments 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.470
 have written what music fit 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.079
 which would you find the beautiful stop 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.399
 good for the intro fits and yes there I have 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.649
 I picked out a couple two 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.379
 three four five and six and the first 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.969
 intro you see six introns that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.430
 first is the or again 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.750
 quotes old intro with the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.660
 music now were not as nice 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.129
 not really liked that either 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.000
 and yes, then two three four 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.430
 five and six 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.410
 So if the first intro is best 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.989
 like with the older music or with 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.489
 the original music can do that as well 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.039
 like the comments three times from yesteryear 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.870
 but is that fixed and otherwise two 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.540
 three four, five or six, then 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.640
 decide that and we'll see 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.040
 what comes out for an intro then i have 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.119
 then small favorites but if you can 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.920
 Maybe back then, maybe he'll come 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.900
 even out and see you next 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.900
 video again with an intro
