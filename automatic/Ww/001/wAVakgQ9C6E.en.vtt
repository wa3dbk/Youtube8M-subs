00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.150
 today we are going to test the 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.580
 visuality let's check the tanks of 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.010
 the gasoline of these cars that now 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.500
 They are in this test already annexation 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.660
 we did in the previous console the 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.009
 we did in a 360 and so really what 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.140
 What we find is that if they bring gas 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.850
 2 frank is in story mode until 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.980
 we saw the animation of how the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.110
 gasoline as it dripped however 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.030
 when we go online online 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.640
 we found that there is no animation there is no 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.920
 video of how gasoline only falls 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.140
 we know it's there because it exploits 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.760
 auto when we give different impacts 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 at this height where I am giving 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.840
 now the impacts and right now we are 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.730
 here in story mode we are with 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.290
 this with michael comes to say with 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.480
 franklin but there is not a difference very 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.790
 big and well here we are already with 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.650
 michael we already gave him the third impact of 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.360
 bullet and this I think it was successful 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.220
 this one sticks to what is the tank 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
 of gasoline and we can see how it is 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.300
 spilling gasoline here results 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.520
 interesting to see because as you can see 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.399
 he is first person and we can 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.260
 clearly identify the part where 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.149
 measure the level of gasoline and let's see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.350
 if you lower the gasoline level here what 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.979
 we have as 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.009
 is the indicator that is on the right in 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.530
 the little circle on the right is 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.780
 loaded to the left side this 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.119
 little small but hopefully and if they can 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.549
 see clearly I 'm already seeing 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.799
 that is lowering the level of gasoline 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.580
 is lowering the needle then right now 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.039
 is close to the letter f of full and 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.740
 is going to go to the other letter that is already 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.080
 empty and well let's see we're already 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.450
 reaching almost half the tank 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.069
 let's check this I tried to make several 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.960
 tests even with airplanes but 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.929
 the planes the only thing I achieved was 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.060
 exploit the turbines and then not with the 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.630
 aircraft it is very difficult to do this no no 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.909
 I could not make it say that a method 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.940
 to get it to identify where it is 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.440
 gasoline already because I really do not 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.360
 identify where the fuel is 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 the aircraft in the helicopter is worse 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.619
 because that fate I could not identify 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.810
 where was it also because the planes 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.789
 it's a little easier because in theory 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.470
 It is in the wings 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.149
 However, I shot the wings because 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.770
 the only thing he could do was set fire to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.090
 turbines and pump explode 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.400
 now that we are halfway through 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.260
 gas tank we are half way 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 of the gas tank and that's it 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.340
 lowering is lowering the needle that is the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 gasoline indicator really yes 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 it works because according to 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.750
 spilling gas goes down the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.180
 gasoline indicator then this 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.030
 if it works if it works quite well and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.250
 Well, let's see, let's get to 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.770
 completely download the tank 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.900
 gasoline from this car and to see what it is 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.540
 what happens to see what happens if 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.480
 really stop walking ok it happens not 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.650
 and here we are going down and we go down a 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.050
 little more than what is the level we go down 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.370
 already at the level of half the tank and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.140
 We are almost halfway through the tank and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.810
 right now we are spilling and spilling 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.880
 fuel until this is finished it 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 has to finish this one has to 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.330
 to finish totally we are with the car 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.040
 with this car that is a very car 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.770
 good for four races 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.740
 doors that I recommend this car 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.740
 identify it is an after 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.600
 and when they see it in 4 doors goal goes to 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 overcome because this is a very good car 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.960
 for four-door racing 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.540
 keep pouring and see everything 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.550
 spill wow terrifies me enough 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.770
 fuel and this plan is not yet finished 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.930
 gasoline remains as of 100 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.150
 liters and it is already learned already missed a 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.620
 little bit of the reservation was lit 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.260
 little bit of the reservation also uses that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.480
 It works that's very good I liked that 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.160
 detail that put the foquito works 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.800
 of the reservation already caught on that no longer 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.890
 It takes time for gasoline to run out and you have left 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.400
 do not start the author 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.160
 let's hear if they are still the engine 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.350
 I'm still accelerating it here 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.470
 it is not failing it is already failing 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.530
 make him bile pull him 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.550
 do the villa as you want no longer pull 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.710
 ay ay 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.840
 and that stoppage 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.920
 and so for that but now we put it on 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.920
 how do i have jable 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.560
 it has already been completely turned off 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.770
 and tried it I try to learn another 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.229
 Once the auto michael is turned on, 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.669
 but we are going to climb again not 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.699
 we are going to give up 1 seville 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.240
 that is dripping already threw all the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.240
 gasoline 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.760
 there is the attempt again no longer 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.550
 turn on and you have not learned this car 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.930
 This car is no longer good, it goes to the garbage 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.270
 and now let's do it with a 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.560
 tractor what do you think if 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.180
 we do with a tractor truck here we see 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.890
 the indicator of the area is 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.830
 completely full is the dam 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.090
 full and then we are going to make some impacts 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.940
 here to the truck 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.700
 genoa red dots to blows I'm not going to 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.680
 power this I will not be able to destroy 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.100
 then we 're going to grab a gun and 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.990
 point let's liquidate it another trick 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.040
 and he's already pulling and he's throwing 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.600
 fuel is already pulling the diesel and 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.460
 and then there is nothing else to wait for 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.470
 spill all the diesel to make 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 also the test in this tractor truck to 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.460
 see let's see the indicator 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.370
 this one is spilling very fast 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.780
 and it's almost halfway to the tank 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.090
 it is spilling much faster 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.370
 that the high 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.889
 let's see how far we can go 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.520
 so with a 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.379
 with the tank spilling diesel that 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.789
 although it brings two diesel tanks 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:48.050
 it only has the animation does not have 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:50.009
 let's say that the video of how the 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.520
 fuel and it does in the part of the 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.830
 means it does not especially where it 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.940
 find the fuel tank 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.950
 here we are going to get to the reserve 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.110
 we're going to get to the reservation and we're 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.660
 reaching the red part and as you can see 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.500
 the little bit of the left has already been lit 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.740
 where is the steering wheel to the left 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.150
 you can appreciate a little bit that is 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.580
 the one that announced to us that it is 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.200
 exhausting the fuel them and going 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.070
 accelerating see how far you can 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.070
 get here now 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.870
 knopf 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.870
 Until we arrived 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.450
 let's go down and let's go up another 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.100
 time to try to turn it on we're going to 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.900
 try to turn it on again to see what 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.020
 So let's see if it pulls but it's not going to 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.020
 pull 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.760
 we'll see 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.290
 no longer ignited then good friends this 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.690
 was the test of gasoline so that 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.760
 see that if they bring gasoline to cars and 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.170
 that the gas level meters 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.170
 they also serve goodbye 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.850
 how good 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 plus
