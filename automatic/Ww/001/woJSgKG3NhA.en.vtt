00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
get some gameplay from a different class

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.440 
get some gameplay from a different class
the<00:00:11.040> nice<00:00:11.219> all<00:00:11.429> class<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> I've<00:00:11.940> been<00:00:12.179> doing<00:00:12.389> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the nice all class and I've been doing a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.570 
the nice all class and I've been doing a
lot<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.960> ESL<00:00:13.230> class<00:00:13.530> since<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.190> patch

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
lot with the ESL class since the patch

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.210 
lot with the ESL class since the patch
was<00:00:14.820> released<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.360> few<00:00:15.389> weeks<00:00:15.599> ago<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
was released a few weeks ago and so I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.650 
was released a few weeks ago and so I
thought<00:00:17.460> I'd<00:00:17.640> try<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> change<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.630> little

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
thought I'd try to change it up a little

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
thought I'd try to change it up a little
bit<00:00:18.869> more<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.850> show<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.910> guys<00:00:20.970> some<00:00:21.180> gameplay

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bit more and show you guys some gameplay

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.000 
bit more and show you guys some gameplay
from<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.960> different<00:00:22.230> classes<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:22.920> in

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
from some different classes and so in

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
from some different classes and so in
this<00:00:23.100> video<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.430> wanted<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> talk<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.289> what's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
this video I wanted to talk about what's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.170 
this video I wanted to talk about what's
become<00:00:25.769> insane<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.400> my<00:00:26.490> favorite<00:00:26.939> class

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
become insane probably my favorite class

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.099 
become insane probably my favorite class
setup<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.529> engineer<00:00:29.039> class<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
setup to use in the engineer class and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
setup to use in the engineer class and
that<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> zero<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.070> you'll<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.399> throughout

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that is a zero as you'll see throughout

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.180 
that is a zero as you'll see throughout
this<00:00:32.759> game<00:00:32.940> play<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> m4a1<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
this game play that's the m4a1 and the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790 
this game play that's the m4a1 and the
attachments<00:00:35.640> i'm<00:00:35.760> using<00:00:36.149> our<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.140> foregrip

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
attachments i'm using our the foregrip

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
attachments i'm using our the foregrip
and<00:00:38.010> flash<00:00:38.460> suppressor<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.149> later

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and flash suppressor and then later

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.020 
and flash suppressor and then later
you'll<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:39.870> i<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> red<00:00:40.559> dot<00:00:40.770> sight

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
you'll see how i have a red dot sight

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.810 
you'll see how i have a red dot sight
equipped<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> scope<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> thought

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
equipped for the scope and so I thought

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.950 
equipped for the scope and so I thought
I'd<00:00:44.940> talk<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.750> setup

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I'd talk a little bit about this setup

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
I'd talk a little bit about this setup
and<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.520> first<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> luck<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> m4a1

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and you know first of luck with the m4a1

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.650 
and you know first of luck with the m4a1
I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.670> game<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I think the game for a one of was you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.209 
I think the game for a one of was you
know<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:52.350> good<00:00:52.590> before<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> patch

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
know it was pretty good before the patch

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.119 
know it was pretty good before the patch
so<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
so I don't really know if it's a

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.920 
so I don't really know if it's a
statistics<00:00:56.129> change<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.030> um<00:00:57.510> post

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
statistics change at all really um post

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
statistics change at all really um post
patch<00:00:58.309> just<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.820> was<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
patch just because you know it was a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
patch just because you know it was a
pretty<00:01:00.120> solid<00:01:00.390> woman<00:01:00.629> before<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
pretty solid woman before and it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
pretty solid woman before and it's
definitely<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.879> good<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:04.019> not

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
definitely just as good now if not

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.370 
definitely just as good now if not
better<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.939> I<00:01:05.939> think<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.020> setup<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
better and I think with the setup that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.219 
better and I think with the setup that
i'm<00:01:07.470> using<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.040> accentuates

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
i'm using it really accentuates

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.520 
i'm using it really accentuates
accentuates<00:01:10.229> its<00:01:10.979> positives<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.500> i

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
accentuates its positives and you know i

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
accentuates its positives and you know i
think<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.010> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> probably<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> aks-74u

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
think this kind of probably the aks-74u

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.190 
think this kind of probably the aks-74u
are<00:01:16.700> from<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.790> I've<00:01:17.909> seen<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> best<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
are from what I've seen the the best to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
are from what I've seen the the best to
engineer<00:01:19.830> weapons<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.850> best<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
engineer weapons to use the best to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.230 
engineer weapons to use the best to
carbines<00:01:21.930> or<00:01:22.860> SMG<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
carbines or SMG is to use for the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
carbines or SMG is to use for the
engineer<00:01:24.540> class<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.280> i<00:01:26.340> think

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
engineer class and so you know i think

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
engineer class and so you know i think
they<00:01:26.580> said<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.790> would<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.150> work<00:01:27.240> with

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
they said it would probably work with

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.210 
they said it would probably work with
either<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.619> thing<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.799> i<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
either one the one thing that i do like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
either one the one thing that i do like
a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.430> bit<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> m4a1<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.869> opposed

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
a little bit about the m4a1 as opposed

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.850 
a little bit about the m4a1 as opposed
to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> aks-74u<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.710> m4a1<00:01:34.710> has<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to the aks-74u is that the m4a1 has a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
to the aks-74u is that the m4a1 has a
bit<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> faster<00:01:35.759> fire<00:01:36.030> rate<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.750> going

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
bit of a faster fire rate so it's going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
bit of a faster fire rate so it's going
to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.430> close

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to be a little bit better at close

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.700 
to be a little bit better at close
ranges<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> engineer

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
ranges which I do like for the engineer

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
ranges which I do like for the engineer
weapons<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> engineer

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
weapons I kind of think of engineer

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
weapons I kind of think of engineer
weapons<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.140> more<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> close<00:01:44.460> range<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
weapons as more of a close range or the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.490 
weapons as more of a close range or the
engineer<00:01:45.689> classes<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
engineer classes are more of a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
engineer classes are more of a
close-range<00:01:47.100> kit<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:48.149> least<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.479> you're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
close-range kit at least when you're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230 
close-range kit at least when you're
taking<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.930> infantry<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.939> where<00:01:51.119> most

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
taking on infantry and that's where most

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.590 
taking on infantry and that's where most
of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> guns<00:01:51.780> excel<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
of the guns excel and so I kind of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560 
of the guns excel and so I kind of
geared<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.140> set<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.470> towards<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.570> we're

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
geared this set up towards the we're

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
geared this set up towards the we're
with<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.079> mind<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:58.920> why<00:01:59.040> I've

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
with that in mind and so that's why I've

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.700 
with that in mind and so that's why I've
got<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> forum<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.790> flash<00:01:59.969> suppressor<00:02:00.450> on

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
got the forum and flash suppressor on

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
got the forum and flash suppressor on
because<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> flash<00:02:02.040> suppressor<00:02:02.399> decreases

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
because the flash suppressor decreases

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.639 
because the flash suppressor decreases
recoil<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> lot<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.229> people<00:02:04.320> do

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
recoil and I know a lot of people do

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
recoil and I know a lot of people do
like<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.829> use<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.159> heavy<00:02:05.369> barrel<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.939> these

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
like to use the heavy barrel on these

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.080 
like to use the heavy barrel on these
engineer<00:02:06.540> weapons<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.459> are<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.759> order<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
engineer weapons but are in order to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
engineer weapons but are in order to
give<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> store<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.840> added<00:02:10.259> range<00:02:10.530> on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
give them the store that added range on

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.559 
give them the store that added range on
the<00:02:11.069> weapon<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.270> prefer<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the weapon but I kind of prefer the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.770 
the weapon but I kind of prefer the
flash<00:02:12.870> suppressor<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
flash suppressor just be

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.020 
flash suppressor just be
it<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.350> really<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.310> makes<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.850> gun

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it it really just makes this gun

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.059 
it it really just makes this gun
extremely<00:02:16.750> good<00:02:16.990> at<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.500> know<00:02:17.530> medium<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
extremely good at you know medium to

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.620 
extremely good at you know medium to
close<00:02:18.340> ranges<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.150> well<00:02:19.270> see<00:02:19.300> over<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
close ranges and as well see over the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.930 
close ranges and as well see over the
course<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.020> video<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.350> i<00:02:20.800> can<00:02:21.250> take<00:02:21.459> guys

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
course of this video I i can take guys

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
course of this video I i can take guys
out<00:02:22.209> pretty<00:02:22.630> quickly<00:02:22.959> with<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.410> setup<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.950> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
out pretty quickly with this setup and I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.880 
out pretty quickly with this setup and I
like<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.700> use<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> foregrip<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:25.990> it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
like to use the foregrip because it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.620 
like to use the foregrip because it
reduces<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.580> little<00:02:27.819> bit<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.030> recoil<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
reduces a little bit of the recoil it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.809 
reduces a little bit of the recoil it
doesn't<00:02:28.980> increase<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.220> bullet<00:02:30.520> spread<00:02:30.730> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
doesn't increase the bullet spread I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.180 
doesn't increase the bullet spread I
think<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.180> little<00:02:31.330> bit<00:02:31.569> but<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.080> don't<00:02:33.010> think

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
think a little bit but I don't think

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.640 
think a little bit but I don't think
it's<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.370> noticeable<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:35.140> know<00:02:35.230> it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
it's that noticeable and you know it's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.350 
it's that noticeable and you know it's
not<00:02:35.800> like<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.069> really<00:02:36.250> have<00:02:36.520> any<00:02:36.819> better

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
not like you really have any better

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.210 
not like you really have any better
options<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.930> think<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.350> could<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.680> leave<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
options I think you could just leave the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.370 
options I think you could just leave the
leave<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.180> attachments<00:02:40.720> lot<00:02:40.870> empty<00:02:41.230> or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
leave this the attachments lot empty or

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.580 
leave this the attachments lot empty or
the<00:02:41.680> item<00:02:42.370> slot<00:02:42.520> open<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.050> think

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the item slot open but you know I think

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
the item slot open but you know I think
the<00:02:44.680> foregrip<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.310> probably<00:02:45.550> good<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.760> have

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
the foregrip is probably good to have

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
the foregrip is probably good to have
there<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.600> just<00:02:46.780> kind<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.050> filled<00:02:47.709> up<00:02:47.860> this

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there and it just kind of filled up this

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.680 
there and it just kind of filled up this
class<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> think<00:02:48.400> nicely<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.480> you'll<00:02:49.630> see

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
class I think nicely so here you'll see

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
class I think nicely so here you'll see
I<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.140> i<00:02:50.350> really<00:02:50.860> just<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:51.400> these<00:02:51.670> close

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
I can i really just you know these close

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.820 
I can i really just you know these close
quarters<00:02:52.000> situations<00:02:52.840> as<00:02:52.989> gun<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.350> really

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
quarters situations as gun is really

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.320 
quarters situations as gun is really
really<00:02:54.250> good<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.760> whereas<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
really good and whereas in the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.180 
really good and whereas in the
long-range<00:02:55.780> encounters<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.500> it's<00:02:57.010> not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
long-range encounters it's it's not

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.710 
long-range encounters it's it's not
going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.430> work<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.090> find<00:02:58.600> that

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
going to work as well but I find that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.090 
going to work as well but I find that
for<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.110> most<00:02:59.290> part<00:02:59.410> that's<00:02:59.680> not<00:02:59.830> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
for the most part that's not going to be

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.949 
for the most part that's not going to be
a<00:03:00.160> big<00:03:00.459> deal<00:03:00.569> when<00:03:01.569> you're<00:03:01.720> using<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
a big deal when you're using the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.270 
a big deal when you're using the
engineer<00:03:02.260> class<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.709> because<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:03.190> know

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
engineer class just because you know

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.830 
engineer class just because you know
when<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.489> use<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.819> engineer<00:03:04.180> class<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.510> tend<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
when I use the engineer class I tend to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.880 
when I use the engineer class I tend to
play<00:03:05.200> as<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.819> tend<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.510> play<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.319> more

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
play as if I tend to play you know more

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.860 
play as if I tend to play you know more
close<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.400> enemy<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.850> most<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
close to the enemy and most of the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.360 
close to the enemy and most of the
encounters<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.769> engagements<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
encounters are the engagements that I

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.190 
encounters are the engagements that I
get<00:03:12.519> into<00:03:12.610> our<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.330> going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> be<00:03:13.690> close<00:03:13.900> range

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
get into our are going to be close range

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.590 
get into our are going to be close range
so<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.769> sort<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.610> set<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.850> class<00:03:16.060> up<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.420> take

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
so I I sort of set this class up to take

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.020 
so I I sort of set this class up to take
advantage<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> does<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> depend<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
advantage of that so does it depend a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.370 
advantage of that so does it depend a
little<00:03:19.180> bit<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.600> places<00:03:19.870> I'll<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.290> you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
little bit on the places I'll that you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.910 
little bit on the places I'll that you
use<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:20.950> i<00:03:21.190> think<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:23.200> least<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:23.860> the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
use but i think that at least for the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.080 
use but i think that at least for the
way<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.579> play<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.790> engineer

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
way I you like to play the engineer

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.960 
way I you like to play the engineer
class<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:26.230> know<00:03:26.320> if<00:03:26.440> I'm<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.880> be

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
class you know if I'm not going to be

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.509 
class you know if I'm not going to be
focusing<00:03:28.320> heavily<00:03:29.320> on<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.680> vehicles<00:03:30.250> and

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
focusing heavily on the vehicles and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.430 
focusing heavily on the vehicles and
this<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.850> really<00:03:31.269> good<00:03:31.390> anti-infantry<00:03:32.049> set

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
this is a really good anti-infantry set

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.800 
this is a really good anti-infantry set
up<00:03:32.530> as<00:03:32.680> well<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.220> one<00:03:34.120> other<00:03:34.150> thing<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.570> wanted

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
up as well and one other thing I wanted

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.210 
up as well and one other thing I wanted
to<00:03:34.870> mention<00:03:35.049> about<00:03:35.500> using<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.980> flash

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
to mention about using the flash

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.400 
to mention about using the flash
suppressor<00:03:36.730> especially<00:03:37.180> also<00:03:37.570> over<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.900> the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
suppressor especially also over the the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.479 
suppressor especially also over the the
laser<00:03:38.650> sight<00:03:38.920> because<00:03:39.100> that's<00:03:39.340> another

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
laser sight because that's another

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.949 
laser sight because that's another
option<00:03:39.730> especially<00:03:40.150> for<00:03:40.630> close-range

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
option especially for close-range

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.960 
option especially for close-range
situations<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.769> mean<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.489> kind<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.790> tell

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
situations I mean you can kind of tell

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.370 
situations I mean you can kind of tell
already<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.329> hipfire<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.049> weapon<00:03:44.320> is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
already the hipfire for this weapon is

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.069 
already the hipfire for this weapon is
pretty<00:03:44.739> good<00:03:44.890> already<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.780> know<00:03:46.900> mate

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
pretty good already and you know mate

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.270 
pretty good already and you know mate
with<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.380> laser<00:03:47.590> sight<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.040> would<00:03:48.070> just

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
with the laser sight that would just

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.710 
with the laser sight that would just
probably<00:03:48.519> make<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.820> ridiculous<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.510> haven't

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
probably make it ridiculous I haven't

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.240 
probably make it ridiculous I haven't
even<00:03:49.780> tried<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.140> out<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.769> know<00:03:50.890> my<00:03:51.040> guess

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
even tried it out but you know my guess

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.800 
even tried it out but you know my guess
is<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.489> would<00:03:51.700> be<00:03:51.820> pretty<00:03:52.239> effective<00:03:52.420> as

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
is that would be pretty effective as

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.300 
is that would be pretty effective as
well<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.079> it's<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.380> really<00:03:53.530> necessary<00:03:53.799> i

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
well but it's not really necessary i

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.220 
well but it's not really necessary i
think<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:55.390> just<00:03:55.450> because<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.079> can

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
think it just because that you can

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.900 
think it just because that you can
already<00:03:56.320> tell<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.769> crosshairs<00:03:57.250> are<00:03:57.430> pretty

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
already tell the crosshairs are pretty

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.420 
already tell the crosshairs are pretty
small<00:03:58.480> anyways<00:03:59.260> when<00:03:59.470> im<00:03:59.560> hit<00:03:59.680> firing<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.280> i

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
small anyways when im hit firing and i

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.759 
small anyways when im hit firing and i
think<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.359> works<00:04:01.540> pretty<00:04:01.750> well<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.140> i<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
think it works pretty well so i like the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.280 
think it works pretty well so i like the
flash<00:04:02.980> suppressor<00:04:03.750> more<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.959> because<00:04:05.019> it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
flash suppressor more just because it

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.440 
flash suppressor more just because it
does<00:04:05.470> give<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:06.010> reduced<00:04:06.850> recoil<00:04:07.090> as

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
does give you that reduced recoil as

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.910 
does give you that reduced recoil as
well<00:04:07.660> which<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.410> know<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.530> think<00:04:08.769> that's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
well which you know I think that's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.940 
well which you know I think that's
always<00:04:09.280> helpful<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:11.500> definitely

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
always helpful and it's it's definitely

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.890 
always helpful and it's it's definitely
a<00:04:12.010> worthwhile<00:04:12.400> attachment<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.630> I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
a worthwhile attachment to you that I I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.620 
a worthwhile attachment to you that I I
think<00:04:14.560> in<00:04:14.680> general<00:04:14.890> what<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.519> found<00:04:15.820> host

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
think in general what I found host

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.569 
think in general what I found host
patches<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.320> either<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.799> flash<00:04:18.070> suppressor

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
patches that either the flash suppressor

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.909 
patches that either the flash suppressor
or<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.760> heavy<00:04:18.940> barrel<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.479> your<00:04:19.690> best<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
or the heavy barrel is your best is the

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.500 
or the heavy barrel is your best is the
best<00:04:21.190> way<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> go<00:04:21.549> for<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:21.880> third<00:04:22.120> attachment

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
best way to go for that third attachment

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.050 
best way to go for that third attachment
slot<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.610> still<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:24.789> use<00:04:24.909> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
slot and I still like to use the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.820 
slot and I still like to use the
foregrip<00:04:25.390> I'd<00:04:25.570> say<00:04:25.750> for<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> most<00:04:26.229> part

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
foregrip I'd say for the most part

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.490 
foregrip I'd say for the most part
and<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.509> exception<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.050> underslung

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and the the exception of the underslung

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.960 
and the the exception of the underslung
rail<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> do<00:04:30.009> like<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.280> use<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.580> from<00:04:30.699> time<00:04:30.819> to

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
rail I do like to use that from time to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.589 
rail I do like to use that from time to
time<00:04:31.000> as<00:04:31.270> I've<00:04:31.389> talked<00:04:31.599> about<00:04:31.900> with<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.599> with

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
time as I've talked about with the with

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.600 
time as I've talked about with the with
my<00:04:34.720> favorite<00:04:35.050> class<00:04:35.650> setup<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.099> I<00:04:36.189> talked

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
my favorite class setup that I talked

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.270 
my favorite class setup that I talked
about<00:04:36.639> earlier<00:04:36.819> with<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.240> m416<00:04:38.009> but<00:04:39.009> for<00:04:39.219> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
about earlier with the m416 but for the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.439 
about earlier with the m416 but for the
most<00:04:39.460> part<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.819> think<00:04:39.849> you<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.330> the

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
most part I think you know the

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.450 
most part I think you know the
combination<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:41.139> for<00:04:41.500> grip<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.889> heavy<00:04:42.099> barrel

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
combination of for grip and heavy barrel

or for grip and flash suppressor is
going<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.289> be<00:04:44.409> you<00:04:44.949> know<00:04:45.039> really<00:04:45.219> effective

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
going to be you know really effective

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.689 
going to be you know really effective
for<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.090> most<00:04:46.300> part<00:04:46.539> end<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:48.129> probably

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
for the most part end it's a probably

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.969 
for the most part end it's a probably
the<00:04:48.819> best<00:04:49.389> way<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.599> go<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:49.990> want<00:04:50.349> to<00:04:50.560> reduce

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
the best way to go if you want to reduce

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.640 
the best way to go if you want to reduce
recoil<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.879> with<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.479> gun<00:04:52.780> like<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.020> m4a1

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
recoil and with a gun like the m4a1

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.350 
recoil and with a gun like the m4a1
which<00:04:53.800> i<00:04:53.979> think<00:04:54.039> is<00:04:54.250> already<00:04:54.639> sort<00:04:54.939> of<00:04:55.060> geared

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
which i think is already sort of geared

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.969 
which i think is already sort of geared
more<00:04:55.599> towards<00:04:55.930> those<00:04:56.050> medium<00:04:56.379> to<00:04:56.469> close-range

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
more towards those medium to close-range

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.689 
more towards those medium to close-range
situations<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:58.419> know<00:04:58.449> using<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:58.960> setup

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
situations you know using this setup

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.189 
situations you know using this setup
when<00:05:00.699> this<00:05:00.819> gun<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.060> going<00:05:01.449> to<00:05:01.539> be<00:05:01.629> extremely

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
when this gun is going to be extremely

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.050 
when this gun is going to be extremely
effective<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:03.039> think<00:05:03.069> as<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.430> guys<00:05:03.669> really<00:05:03.849> see

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
effective I think as you guys really see

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.779 
effective I think as you guys really see
over<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.300> course<00:05:04.509> of<00:05:04.629> this<00:05:04.750> gameplay<00:05:05.050> it's<00:05:05.530> a

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
over the course of this gameplay it's a

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.159 
over the course of this gameplay it's a
it's<00:05:06.789> definitely<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.270> set<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:07.990> can't

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
it's definitely a set of that you can't

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.230 
it's definitely a set of that you can't
really<00:05:08.349> go<00:05:08.469> wrong<00:05:08.500> with<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.490> mean<00:05:10.120> it's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
really go wrong with and I mean it's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.339 
really go wrong with and I mean it's
really<00:05:10.389> a<00:05:10.449> gun<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.719> you<00:05:10.870> can't<00:05:11.199> go<00:05:11.319> wrong

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
really a gun that you can't go wrong

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.830 
really a gun that you can't go wrong
with<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.979> its<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.550> probably<00:05:12.879> I'd<00:05:13.300> say<00:05:13.330> one<00:05:13.810> of

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
with to its it's probably I'd say one of

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.050 
with to its it's probably I'd say one of
if<00:05:14.050> not<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.259> best<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:15.430> engineer<00:05:15.789> weapons

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
if not the best the engineer weapons

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.219 
if not the best the engineer weapons
that<00:05:16.210> out<00:05:16.419> there<00:05:16.659> and<00:05:16.900> like<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.110> mentioned

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
that out there and like I mentioned

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.529 
that out there and like I mentioned
earlier<00:05:17.500> one<00:05:18.400> other<00:05:18.520> thing<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.849> want<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.180> just

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
earlier one other thing I want to just

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.999 
earlier one other thing I want to just
quickly<00:05:19.629> mention<00:05:19.840> about<00:05:20.199> this<00:05:20.349> class<00:05:20.650> setup

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
quickly mention about this class setup

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.790 
quickly mention about this class setup
is<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.550> pistol<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.360> use<00:05:22.960> in<00:05:23.169> a<00:05:23.199> you<00:05:23.710> know

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
is the pistol that I use in a you know

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.559 
is the pistol that I use in a you know
I'm<00:05:23.919> not<00:05:23.949> sure<00:05:24.310> if<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.580> really<00:05:25.029> seem<00:05:25.240> use<00:05:25.419> it

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
I'm not sure if I you really seem use it

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.059 
I'm not sure if I you really seem use it
at<00:05:25.659> all<00:05:25.750> in<00:05:25.900> this<00:05:26.020> video<00:05:26.349> or<00:05:26.529> if<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.710> even<00:05:26.770> have

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
at all in this video or if I even have

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.119 
at all in this video or if I even have
any<00:05:27.219> quick<00:05:27.430> foot<00:05:27.669> what<00:05:27.849> i<00:05:27.879> found<00:05:28.150> i<00:05:28.330> think<00:05:28.629> is

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
any quick foot what i found i think is

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.740 
any quick foot what i found i think is
really<00:05:30.129> the<00:05:30.219> best<00:05:30.250> pistol<00:05:30.759> use<00:05:31.090> at<00:05:31.270> least<00:05:31.300> you

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
really the best pistol use at least you

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.330 
really the best pistol use at least you
know<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.990> kind<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.770> I've<00:05:32.949> talked<00:05:33.129> a<00:05:33.190> little

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
know I I kind of I've talked a little

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.189 
know I I kind of I've talked a little
bit<00:05:33.550> as<00:05:33.669> before<00:05:34.060> but<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:34.449> like<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:34.990> usually

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
bit as before but I like to usually

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.320 
bit as before but I like to usually
balance<00:05:35.770> my<00:05:35.889> pistol<00:05:36.370> with<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:37.000> weapon<00:05:37.300> that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
balance my pistol with the weapon that

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570 
balance my pistol with the weapon that
i'm<00:05:37.539> using<00:05:37.569> so<00:05:38.080> if<00:05:38.349> i'm<00:05:38.889> using<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.219> long-range

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
i'm using so if i'm using a long-range

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.149 
i'm using so if i'm using a long-range
weapon<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.449> i<00:05:40.539> want<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.900> use<00:05:41.319> a<00:05:41.590> pistol

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
weapon that and i want to use a pistol

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.040 
weapon that and i want to use a pistol
that's<00:05:42.430> going<00:05:42.849> to<00:05:42.909> be<00:05:42.969> really<00:05:43.089> good<00:05:43.240> at<00:05:43.449> close

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
that's going to be really good at close

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.529 
that's going to be really good at close
ranges<00:05:44.469> so<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.800> know<00:05:45.009> for<00:05:45.460> example<00:05:45.550> with<00:05:46.509> a

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
ranges so you know for example with a

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.149 
ranges so you know for example with a
sniper<00:05:46.990> rifle<00:05:47.169> which<00:05:47.589> is<00:05:47.710> really<00:05:47.889> good<00:05:48.039> at

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
sniper rifle which is really good at

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.159 
sniper rifle which is really good at
long<00:05:48.370> ranges<00:05:48.669> i<00:05:48.870> generally<00:05:49.870> want<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:50.050> use<00:05:50.139> a

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
long ranges i generally want to use a

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.740 
long ranges i generally want to use a
pistol<00:05:50.469> that<00:05:50.889> can<00:05:51.490> do<00:05:51.580> really<00:05:51.729> well<00:05:51.909> at<00:05:51.969> Short

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
pistol that can do really well at Short

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.689 
pistol that can do really well at Short
ranges<00:05:52.810> so<00:05:53.289> something<00:05:53.650> like<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.860> g18<00:05:54.159> or<00:05:54.580> the

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
ranges so something like the g18 or the

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.640 
ranges so something like the g18 or the
GGN<00:05:55.000> suppressed<00:05:55.419> or<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.259> know<00:05:56.349> even<00:05:56.379> the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
GGN suppressed or you know even the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.110 
GGN suppressed or you know even the
magnum<00:05:56.949> or<00:05:57.009> the<00:05:57.129> rex<00:05:57.339> which<00:05:57.550> are<00:05:57.729> both<00:05:57.849> you

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
magnum or the rex which are both you

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.430 
magnum or the rex which are both you
know<00:05:58.210> pretty<00:05:58.360> good<00:05:58.569> close<00:05:58.810> range<00:05:59.080> weapons

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
know pretty good close range weapons

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.769 
know pretty good close range weapons
azure<00:05:59.770> close<00:06:00.039> range<00:06:00.219> pistols<00:06:00.580> as<00:06:00.669> well<00:06:00.849> and<00:06:01.089> so

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
azure close range pistols as well and so

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.869 
azure close range pistols as well and so
for<00:06:02.199> this<00:06:02.259> class<00:06:02.529> setup<00:06:02.860> i<00:06:03.009> would<00:06:03.279> probably

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
for this class setup i would probably

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.790 
for this class setup i would probably
recommend<00:06:04.180> using<00:06:04.599> something<00:06:04.960> that<00:06:05.319> has<00:06:05.770> a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
recommend using something that has a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.100 
recommend using something that has a
little<00:06:05.919> more<00:06:06.159> range<00:06:06.729> to<00:06:07.089> it<00:06:07.270> just<00:06:07.569> because

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
little more range to it just because

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.129 
little more range to it just because
into<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.069> m4a1<00:06:09.699> is<00:06:09.940> it's<00:06:10.360> already<00:06:10.599> other

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
into the m4a1 is it's already other

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.050 
into the m4a1 is it's already other
setups<00:06:11.440> already<00:06:11.800> pretty<00:06:12.190> good<00:06:12.310> at<00:06:12.460> it<00:06:12.610> closer

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
setups already pretty good at it closer

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.159 
setups already pretty good at it closer
ranges<00:06:13.270> I<00:06:13.360> mean<00:06:13.479> it's<00:06:13.599> pretty<00:06:13.719> good<00:06:13.960> at<00:06:14.050> all

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
ranges I mean it's pretty good at all

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.360 
ranges I mean it's pretty good at all
ranges<00:06:14.379> with<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.830> exception<00:06:15.219> of<00:06:15.279> maybe

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
ranges with the exception of maybe

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.149 
ranges with the exception of maybe
really<00:06:15.699> long<00:06:15.879> ranges<00:06:16.270> so<00:06:16.509> I<00:06:16.719> probably<00:06:17.710> say<00:06:18.099> you

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
really long ranges so I probably say you

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.279 
really long ranges so I probably say you
know<00:06:18.400> either<00:06:18.969> the<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.539> wrecks<00:06:19.750> of<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:19.960> Magnum

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
know either the the wrecks of the Magnum

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.589 
know either the the wrecks of the Magnum
is<00:06:20.379> a<00:06:20.440> good<00:06:20.889> pistol<00:06:21.099> use<00:06:21.339> with<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.610> setup<00:06:21.940> but

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
is a good pistol use with a setup but

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.089 
is a good pistol use with a setup but
you<00:06:22.750> could<00:06:22.870> also<00:06:23.020> use<00:06:23.139> something<00:06:23.560> like<00:06:23.589> the<00:06:23.770> m9

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
you could also use something like the m9

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.950 
you could also use something like the m9
I<00:06:24.129> think<00:06:24.759> that's<00:06:24.909> a<00:06:25.029> good<00:06:25.180> pistol<00:06:25.419> as<00:06:25.690> well<00:06:25.839> to

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
I think that's a good pistol as well to

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.350 
I think that's a good pistol as well to
use<00:06:26.400> but<00:06:27.400> you<00:06:27.580> know<00:06:27.669> I<00:06:27.699> wouldn't<00:06:28.120> use

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
use but you know I wouldn't use

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.999 
use but you know I wouldn't use
something<00:06:28.779> like<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:29.020> g18<00:06:29.319> because<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:29.830> just

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
something like the g18 because I just

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.260 
something like the g18 because I just
think<00:06:30.190> it's<00:06:30.279> unnecessary<00:06:30.490> and<00:06:31.000> kind<00:06:31.210> of

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
think it's unnecessary and kind of

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.480 
think it's unnecessary and kind of
redundant<00:06:31.629> and<00:06:31.990> so<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:32.919> know<00:06:33.069> when<00:06:33.339> you're

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
redundant and so you know when you're

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.409 
redundant and so you know when you're
when<00:06:33.699> you're<00:06:33.789> going<00:06:34.029> for<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.210> really<00:06:34.389> good

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
when you're going for a really good

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:35.850 
when you're going for a really good
class<00:06:34.690> setup<00:06:35.020> but<00:06:35.139> generally<00:06:35.469> speaking<00:06:35.500> what

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
class setup but generally speaking what

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.860 
class setup but generally speaking what
I'd<00:06:36.130> like<00:06:36.370> to<00:06:36.430> do<00:06:36.639> is<00:06:36.669> I<00:06:36.969> try<00:06:37.419> to<00:06:37.539> sort<00:06:37.810> of

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
I'd like to do is I try to sort of

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.170 
I'd like to do is I try to sort of
balance<00:06:38.620> things<00:06:39.099> out<00:06:39.219> so<00:06:39.430> that<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.580> can

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
balance things out so that I can

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.260 
balance things out so that I can
you<00:06:40.660> know<00:06:40.810> get<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.139> most<00:06:41.350> out<00:06:41.620> of<00:06:42.030> out<00:06:43.030> of<00:06:43.090> all

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
you know get the most out of out of all

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.730 
you know get the most out of out of all
the<00:06:43.360> weapons<00:06:43.660> that<00:06:43.720> I<00:06:43.810> have<00:06:44.020> two<00:06:44.229> are<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.590> out

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
the weapons that I have two are the out

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.379 
the weapons that I have two are the out
of<00:06:44.860> all<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.310> options<00:06:45.729> that<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:45.970> have<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.150> choose

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
of all the options that I have to choose

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.689 
of all the options that I have to choose
from<00:06:46.570> and<00:06:46.870> to<00:06:47.680> try<00:06:47.889> to<00:06:47.919> create<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.580> most

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
from and to try to create the most

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.520 
from and to try to create the most
balanced<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:49.389> possible<00:06:49.870> set<00:06:50.110> up<00:06:50.199> so<00:06:50.380> that<00:06:50.410> I

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
balanced to possible set up so that I

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.029 
balanced to possible set up so that I
can<00:06:50.650> you<00:06:51.310> engage<00:06:51.490> targets<00:06:52.090> at<00:06:52.300> at<00:06:52.539> all<00:06:52.690> ranges

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
can you engage targets at at all ranges

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.110 
can you engage targets at at all ranges
but<00:06:54.039> anyways<00:06:54.370> that's<00:06:54.580> just<00:06:54.789> about<00:06:54.970> all<00:06:55.030> I

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
but anyways that's just about all I

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.370 
but anyways that's just about all I
wanted<00:06:55.300> to<00:06:55.419> talk<00:06:55.630> about<00:06:55.660> in<00:06:56.050> this<00:06:56.169> video

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
these a little more often i have the

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.310 
these a little more often i have the
last<00:07:10.389> couple<00:07:10.660> weeks<00:07:10.900> I've<00:07:11.050> been<00:07:11.080> a<00:07:11.199> little

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
last couple weeks I've been a little

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.650 
last couple weeks I've been a little
busier<00:07:11.740> so<00:07:12.639> I'll<00:07:12.729> try<00:07:12.849> to<00:07:12.910> get<00:07:13.060> back<00:07:13.120> into<00:07:13.419> the

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
busier so I'll try to get back into the

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.540 
busier so I'll try to get back into the
habit<00:07:14.050> of<00:07:14.349> posting<00:07:14.889> these<00:07:15.160> little<00:07:15.430> more

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
habit of posting these little more

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.879 
habit of posting these little more
regular<00:07:15.910> and<00:07:16.150> you<00:07:17.080> know<00:07:17.169> now<00:07:17.289> that<00:07:17.320> the<00:07:17.650> patch

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
regular and you know now that the patch

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:19.200 
regular and you know now that the patch
has<00:07:18.039> been<00:07:18.220> out<00:07:18.340> i'll<00:07:18.460> probably<00:07:18.669> settle<00:07:19.090> back

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
has been out i'll probably settle back

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.719 
has been out i'll probably settle back
into<00:07:19.479> doing<00:07:20.349> some<00:07:20.710> of<00:07:20.830> these<00:07:20.949> other<00:07:21.220> other

videos that I've that I was doing before
the<00:07:24.610> patch<00:07:24.789> and<00:07:25.150> I<00:07:25.300> I<00:07:25.330> did<00:07:25.780> have<00:07:25.930> a<00:07:25.960> another

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
the patch and I I did have a another

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.960 
the patch and I I did have a another
series<00:07:27.160> that<00:07:27.250> I<00:07:27.280> wanted<00:07:27.490> to<00:07:27.550> start<00:07:27.759> that<00:07:27.940> I

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
series that I wanted to start that I

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.460 
series that I wanted to start that I
kind<00:07:28.240> of<00:07:28.270> had<00:07:28.419> to<00:07:28.449> postpone<00:07:28.810> because<00:07:29.229> of<00:07:29.349> the

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
kind of had to postpone because of the

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.629 
kind of had to postpone because of the
patch<00:07:29.680> and<00:07:29.949> I<00:07:29.979> want<00:07:30.160> to<00:07:30.220> do<00:07:30.310> some<00:07:30.430> other<00:07:30.550> stuff

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
patch and I want to do some other stuff

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.990 
patch and I want to do some other stuff
right<00:07:31.509> after<00:07:31.630> the<00:07:31.810> patch<00:07:31.960> was<00:07:32.139> released<00:07:32.169> but<00:07:32.770> I

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
right after the patch was released but I

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.159 
right after the patch was released but I
now<00:07:34.000> that<00:07:34.120> it's<00:07:34.240> been<00:07:34.270> a<00:07:34.360> few<00:07:34.599> weeks<00:07:34.660> I<00:07:34.960> think
