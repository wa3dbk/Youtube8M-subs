00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.380
 to 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello youtube friends that I bring you what 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.059
 that comes to be the unpacking of the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.940
 fixing lenses that can get it in 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.760
 amazon at a price of 10 dollars good 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.760
 let's see what we have here 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.890
 on the other hand 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.400
 apparently only the lenses come as 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.390
 you can see 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.560
 white comes imagined next to the macro 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.560
 that we can read it 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 and we see the biggest lens would have 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 being 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.970
 the fish 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.970
 can see in a very large lens 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.870
 here 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.170
 and here those of would come following the 20 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.170
 cool 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.840
 and at the same time the macro lens 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.759
 can not see 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.759
 look at me and we have macro lens 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.539
 to put it in its place 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.840
 5 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.840
 and it was move that also brings 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.050
 no one what would be a couple of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.040
 stickers for strokes and your camera does not 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.240
 It has the magnetic metal part 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.240
 and we can also see 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.759
 guides stickers 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.350
 and good to appear 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.810
 that would be all we can also see the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.159
 pieces of paper as you know 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.159
 the photo of the lenses 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.750
 and good now we go with the review 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.110
 I was doing to clients now 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.140
 comment and view 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 the links is to try the first 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.400
 hospital I also want to say that my 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.730
 camera I had to put the site 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.739
 desirable since I did not have the part 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.030
 metallic around 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.390
 x 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.390
 but here magnetic itself 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.900
 as you can see 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.330
 I've given myself a great perspective what 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.930
 is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.340
 your opinion looks pretty good this time 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 the quality of life is not so good 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.110
 since I'm using 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.130
 a tablet but as you can see if it looks 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 pretty good 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:14.019
 and look at the difference is 180 degrees 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.019
 Of vision 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.120
 additional you could say 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.120
 and now we go with the white 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.099
 very good now we are going 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.330
 place there is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.190
 because as you can see 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.250
 the prosecutor is similar but in this case 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.490
 there is not that 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:50.990
 they are not only circular you could say 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.950
 but it gives you more that vision the word 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.230
 you can see 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.850
 so 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.520
 that would be the wide angle 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.150
 and there is the difference 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.150
 A) Yes 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.200
 now let's try finally the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.560
 marked links 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.930
 now we go 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.570
 with the last lens it would be the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.420
 macro let's see how it looks with 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.160
 these 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.160
 a few drops that are here 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.770
 as you see on all those rocks 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.570
 can be seen from reality 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.669
 everything nothing else looks out of focus but 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.669
 it will be as close 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.710
 that would be 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.710
 this would be the macro
