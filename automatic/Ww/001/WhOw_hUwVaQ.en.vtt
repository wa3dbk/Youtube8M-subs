00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.691
 Welcome to the new episode of "The Hero You Don't Know". This time I introduced Wukong. 

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:10.990
 (Please note that this is the introduction of "League of the League", Goku is not the "Journey to the West". If you like it, don't say a word, let's talk about his skills. 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.370
 The passiveness of Goku is based on the number of nearby heroes. 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.127
 But there are invisible heroes nearby that won’t start, for example, invisible or into the grass without eyes. 

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.921
 But it’s like LeBron’s avatar. 

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:33.095
 As seen in the picture, it is more defensive than LeBron alone. 

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.557
 When Fei Ai attacked Wukong with a big attack, Wukong used W skills. 

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:44.690
 Fiai will directly pay attention to him when he ignores the avatar. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.862
 But on the other side, after you use W, Fiola will attack the avatar. 

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:55.618
 But if you are too close, you will still be hit. 

00:00:55.618 --> 00:01:06.045
 Goku's Q can be crit, but crit damage only increases the general attack and does not increase Q skill damage. 

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.006
 In other words, the damage of the Q skill does not crit. 

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.094
 Note that Goku's Q skills will increase his range of 125 units. 

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:20.601
 Note that this skill is very useful in harassment. It is also possible to attack the enemy in the escape. 

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:30.444
 The power of Goku is a very good skill. Remember to start the summoner skills like a flash or weak when you turn. 

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:36.242
 The props can also be used but it seems that the "Furious Hydra" cannot be used when it is launched. 

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:40.704
 But when the props like "Demon Dream Knife" are launched, they can be used to remember. 

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:45.417
 Goku is a avatar that is calculated as a hero unit. 

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:50.714
 When you encounter Ai Xi Dajian, etc., you can start W to block the arrow and won’t go through it. 

00:01:50.714 --> 00:02:01.934
 This is a Goku's trick. Go to half and press "S" to let others misunderstand the real body. 

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:10.901
 Note that the avatar does not carry a Buff or a mark like the magic bucket Kaiser. 

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:16.198
 Goku's push tower ability is very strong, including the high damage of Q skills. 

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:22.037
 And you can use the E skill to increase the attack speed to push the tower. 

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:27.751
 Xiaolian on the Wukong line first uses E to break into the general attack and then use Q to attack again. 

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:32.756
 You can continue to pursue or use W to escape without injury. 

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:36.886
 Do you know that Wukong’s skills are the highest bonus skills in the league? 

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:43.642
 (The skill seconds is 4 seconds, 1.2 (120%) per second.) If the output is full, it is 4.8 (480%). 

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:48.814
 After talking about the skills, let’s talk about the story of small knowledge and Wukong. 

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:53.527
 (It is very difficult for Chinese to translate foreigners’ understanding of Chinese into Chinese.) WuKong Chinese means “to understand nothing” 

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:56.572
 The voice actor of Goku is Spike Spencer 

00:02:56.572 --> 00:03:03.078
 (Voice-over works: The Warriors of the Three Kingdoms, the Warriors of the Warring States, the US version of Asai, and the Warring States). He has a lot of animated games and his own radio programs喔

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:10.377
 Wukong is made according to Sun Wukong in the famous Chinese book Journey to the West. 

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:15.633
 Fans of the "Dragon Ball" series pay attention to Wukong only in Japanese to read Gokuu 

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.760
 Sun Wukong’s Japanese is Sun Gokuu 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.850
 The animation and the Goku in the story will ride on the clouds. The Monkey King has freely retractable weapons. 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.816
 In addition, Wukong’s passive skill “Xianshan Stone Monkey” is based on the fact that Wukong is born from stone. 

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:37.446
 In addition, Wukong will become a stone when he dies. 

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:43.494
 Goku is also the first hero in the league to have a "Hero Spotlight" movie. 

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:46.455
 Link to the movie in the movie and have a look. 

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:53.879
 Wukong’s joke action is a weapon that extends the weapon and also represents Wukong’s weapon. 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.885
 The "Flame Monkey King" style may be based on the story of the sacred Tiangong in Journey to the West. 

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:09.311
 When Wukong was trapped in alchemy for a long time, it was not only dead but also stronger. 

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:13.107
 In the picture of Wukong’s national costume, Wukong is fighting with Xiaolong. 

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.526
 The shape of "Shenlong Shengyu" also appeared. 

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:23.867
 Perhaps it is according to the "Journey to the West" in the Tang Dynasty White Horse 

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:29.248
 "Jade Dragon" should be worn in Jade. 

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.875
 Jade is usually carved into a dragon 

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:37.548
 Do you know that Wukong was taught by the Master of Promise? 

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:43.846
 Wukong was also joined by the League of Legends under the guidance of Master Yi to find an opponent worthy of a battle. 

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:49.143
 Everyone knows that Dolan is the one who created the "Dolan's Sword", "Dolan's Shield" and "Dolan's Ring". 

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.770
 I think he should be rich. 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.732
 But do you know that Wukong’s weapon is also built by Dolan? 

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:58.694
 This time, "The Hero You Don't Know" ends here. 

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:03.365
 If you like, remember to like it. This can help me a lot. 

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:07.328
 The next episode wants to see what heroes can also respond in the message喔

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:12.708
 This episode was also based on the response of the audience in the previous episode of Udyr’s film. 

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:16.837
 I hope you like us to see you next time. 

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:17.921
 Peace~ 

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:23.677
