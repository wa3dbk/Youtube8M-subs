demonstrated<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> ball<00:00:17.010> screen<00:00:17.310> now<00:00:17.970> we're

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
demonstrated a ball screen now we're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
demonstrated a ball screen now we're
going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> work<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.750> screens<00:00:19.260> off<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> ball

we're<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.910> try<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.240> utilize<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.900> same

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
we're going to try to utilize the same

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.279 
we're going to try to utilize the same

let's<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.270> those<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.080> time<00:01:16.380> let's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
let's see those two one more time let's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:29.450 
let's see those two one more time let's
start<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> curl<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:28.829> again<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
start with the curl and now again the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.410 
start with the curl and now again the
fade

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.170 

good<00:01:39.420> job

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180

good job
the<00:01:42.180> idea<00:01:42.630> behind<00:01:42.870> of<00:01:43.320> these<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:44.040> teaching<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
the idea behind of these is teaching the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.500 
the idea behind of these is teaching the
receiver<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.320> read<00:01:46.650> his<00:01:47.160> man<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.360> man

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
receiver to read his man is your man

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.840 
receiver to read his man is your man
following<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.410> or<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.010> going<00:01:50.280> over<00:01:50.730> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
following you or is he going over the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.270 
following you or is he going over the
top<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:52.260> one<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> best<00:01:52.980> ways<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
top I think one of the best ways to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.150 
top I think one of the best ways to
teach<00:01:53.820> offensive<00:01:54.570> basketball<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.920> teach

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
teach offensive basketball is to teach

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.610 
teach offensive basketball is to teach
two-on-two<00:01:56.820> basketball<00:01:57.150> where<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.230> can<00:01:58.410> work

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
two-on-two basketball where you can work

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.680 
two-on-two basketball where you can work
on<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.860> pick-and-roll<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.760> where<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.450> can

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
on a pick-and-roll and where you can

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.830 
on a pick-and-roll and where you can
work<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.050> screens<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:02.190> also<00:02:02.370> play<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.600> two

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
work on screens we also play two on two

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.140 
work on screens we also play two on two
with<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.050> passer<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.190> we<00:02:05.370> could<00:02:05.550> set<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
with a passer so we could set up a

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.540 
with a passer so we could set up a
situation<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:07.440> more<00:02:07.710> they<00:02:07.920> understand

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
situation the more they understand

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.970 
situation the more they understand
concepts<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.290> understand<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
concepts the more they understand the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.460 
concepts the more they understand the
