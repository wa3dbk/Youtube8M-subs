cashell<00:01:33.270> me<00:01:33.979> 77<00:01:34.979> pace<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:36.390> even<00:01:37.110> better<00:01:37.229> so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
cashell me 77 pace is even better so

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
cashell me 77 pace is even better so
both<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.750> pretty<00:01:40.020> solid<00:01:40.380> able<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
both of them are pretty solid able to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
both of them are pretty solid able to
chase<00:01:41.070> down<00:01:41.100> those<00:01:41.490> fast<00:01:41.790> strikers<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
chase down those fast strikers and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
chase down those fast strikers and
wingers<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> guess<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
wingers but I guess that's what the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.249 
wingers but I guess that's what the
full-backs<00:01:45.299> ball<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> we'll<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
full-backs ball so we'll go on to the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
full-backs ball so we'll go on to the
right<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:46.770> I'll<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.820> back<00:01:47.850> his

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
right back now I'll right back his
