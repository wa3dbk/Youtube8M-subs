and<00:01:28.210> stuff<00:01:28.390> like<00:01:28.510> that<00:01:28.720> but<00:01:29.380> anywhere<00:01:30.240> pretty

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
and stuff like that but anywhere pretty

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.399 
and stuff like that but anywhere pretty
much<00:01:31.420> I've<00:01:31.540> said<00:01:31.810> everything<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.110> need<00:01:32.260> to<00:01:32.350> say

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
much I've said everything I need to say

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.600 
much I've said everything I need to say
about<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:32.890> I'm<00:01:32.979> just<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.310> cut<00:01:33.460> into

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
about that so I'm just going to cut into

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.080 
about that so I'm just going to cut into
some<00:01:33.760> footage<00:01:34.060> now

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.880 

well<00:01:41.659> there's<00:01:42.020> some<00:01:42.259> gameplay<00:01:42.649> approach

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
well there's some gameplay approach

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.160 
well there's some gameplay approach
basically<00:01:43.640> it's<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:44.299> you'd<00:01:44.479> expect<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.020> go

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
basically it's as you'd expect you go

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.870 
basically it's as you'd expect you go
around<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.649> shoot<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:45.950> boxes<00:01:46.340> for<00:01:46.460> power-ups

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
around you shoot the boxes for power-ups

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.160 
around you shoot the boxes for power-ups
like<00:01:47.060> I've<00:01:47.240> currently<00:01:47.450> got<00:01:47.630> invincibility

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
like I've currently got invincibility

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.630 
like I've currently got invincibility
because<00:01:48.590> I'm<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.829> red<00:01:48.979> tank<00:01:49.220> at<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.399> top<00:01:49.549> of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
because I'm the red tank at the top of

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.310 
because I'm the red tank at the top of
the<00:01:49.700> screen<00:01:50.000> you've<00:01:50.420> got<00:01:50.630> destructible

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
the screen you've got destructible

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.200 
the screen you've got destructible
environments<00:01:51.979> however<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:52.610> shots<00:01:52.939> can

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
environments however you shots can

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.240 
environments however you shots can
bounce<00:01:53.509> officer<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.200> walls<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.189> you

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
bounce officer and walls and that so you

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.679 
bounce officer and walls and that so you
have<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.579> careful<00:01:55.939> out<00:01:56.119> because<00:01:56.450> your<00:01:56.570> own

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
have to be careful out because your own

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.690 
have to be careful out because your own
shots<00:01:57.049> can<00:01:57.259> kill<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.679> you<00:01:58.009> can<00:01:58.159> also<00:01:58.369> kill

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
shots can kill you you can also kill

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.160 
shots can kill you you can also kill
your<00:01:58.880> team<00:01:59.060> yet<00:01:59.299> it's<00:01:59.450> got<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.630> friendly<00:01:59.899> fire

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
your team yet it's got a friendly fire

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.109 
your team yet it's got a friendly fire
on<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.649> have<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.830> be<00:02:00.920> careful<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.310> lot<00:02:01.460> but

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
on so you have to be careful a lot but

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.910 
on so you have to be careful a lot but
obviously<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.110> just<00:02:03.259> for<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.439> team<00:02:03.649> mod

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
obviously this is just for the team mod

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.200 
obviously this is just for the team mod

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
mention as well as things like the power

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.140 
mention as well as things like the power
rocks<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:57.980> there's<00:02:58.430> also<00:02:58.579> a<00:02:58.790> theme

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
rocks and that there's also a theme

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
rocks and that there's also a theme
stages<00:02:59.780> so<00:02:59.870> this<00:02:59.989> one<00:03:00.200> he<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.380> covered<00:03:00.980> in

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
stages so this one he is covered in

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.590 
stages so this one he is covered in
mines<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.549> standard<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.209> also<00:03:02.359> got

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
mines as standard it's also got

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.599 
mines as standard it's also got
teleporters<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.709> obviously<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.069> warp<00:03:04.400> on

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
teleporters so obviously you can warp on

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.640 
teleporters so obviously you can warp on
one<00:03:04.760> side<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> other<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.989> bike<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.440> for

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
one side of the other like bike one for

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.780 
one side of the other like bike one for
the<00:03:06.709> blue<00:03:06.859> one<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.130> go<00:03:07.280> out<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.609> blue

the blue one you go out with the blue

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.120

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
let's just capture the flag as I did

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.410 
let's just capture the flag as I did
sound<00:03:57.769> short<00:03:58.040> off<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:58.670> pretty<00:03:59.150> similar

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
sound short off and it's pretty similar

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.330 
sound short off and it's pretty similar
thought<00:03:59.720> you'd<00:03:59.870> imagine<00:04:00.349> vistas<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.739> flag<00:04:01.099> up

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
thought you'd imagine vistas of flag up

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250 
thought you'd imagine vistas of flag up
together<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.819> tackle<00:04:01.940> back<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.330> your<00:04:02.510> BS<00:04:02.750> so

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
together and tackle back to your BS so

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.280 
together and tackle back to your BS so
it's<00:04:04.099> well<00:04:04.880> capture<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.420> flag<00:04:05.569> really<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.170> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it's well capture the flag really it's a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.660 
it's well capture the flag really it's a
really<00:04:06.440> fun<00:04:06.769> board<00:04:06.950> but<00:04:07.190> then<00:04:07.280> again<00:04:07.430> I'm

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
really fun board but then again I'm

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.309 
really fun board but then again I'm
always<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.209> little<00:04:08.269> capture<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.780> flag<00:04:08.989> boards

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.710 
always a little capture the flag boards
and<00:04:09.790> pretty<00:04:10.790> much<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.060> only<00:04:11.150> things<00:04:11.450> I've<00:04:11.569> got

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
and pretty much the only things I've got

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.630 
and pretty much the only things I've got
left<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.959> see<00:04:12.170> really<00:04:12.500> are<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.519> also

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
left to see really are that you can also

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.460 
left to see really are that you can also
have<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.269> cool<00:04:14.510> little<00:04:14.660> rocket<00:04:15.080> launch<00:04:15.230> type

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
have a cool little rocket launch type

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.289 
have a cool little rocket launch type
thing<00:04:15.680> when<00:04:15.830> you<00:04:15.920> die<00:04:16.100> I've<00:04:16.609> mentioned<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
thing when you die I've mentioned the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.280 
thing when you die I've mentioned the
flamethrower<00:04:17.750> but<00:04:17.900> there's<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.109> rocket

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
flamethrower but there's the rocket

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.870 
flamethrower but there's the rocket
launcher<00:04:18.650> as<00:04:18.739> well<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.280> rocket<00:04:19.549> launcher

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
launcher as well and the rocket launcher

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.580 
launcher as well and the rocket launcher
allows<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.660> actually<00:04:20.780> control<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
allows you to actually control the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.340 
allows you to actually control the
rockets<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.460> that's<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.300> useful<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:24.260> a
