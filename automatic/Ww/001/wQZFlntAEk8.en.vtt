collective<00:02:18.030> foul<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.330> shown<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.840> we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
collective foul it was not shown and we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.990 
collective foul it was not shown and we
knew<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.920> he<00:02:23.010> had<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.370> collective<00:02:23.820> foul

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
knew that he had it for collective foul

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.870 
knew that he had it for collective foul
and<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:24.930> left<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:26.100> next<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> clock

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and we left it the next time the clock

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.940 
and we left it the next time the clock
did<00:02:27.120> not<00:02:27.150> move<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.350> means<00:02:28.530> you're<00:02:28.740> given

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
did not move and that means you're given

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.470 
did not move and that means you're given
an<00:02:29.040> advantage<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> team<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.150> down

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
an advantage to the team that is down

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
an advantage to the team that is down
because<00:02:31.110> once<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> clock<00:02:31.860> does<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.280> move<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
because once the clock does not move it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.060 
because once the clock does not move it
means<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.840> more<00:02:34.050> work<00:02:34.230> because

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
means you have to do more work because

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.710 
means you have to do more work because
we're<00:02:35.220> already<00:02:35.400> ahead<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.450> needed<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
we're already ahead and we needed the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720 
we're already ahead and we needed the
clock<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.230> run<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.800> play<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
clock to run because you play to the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.980 
clock to run because you play to the
club<00:02:38.940> with<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> play<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> games<00:02:39.840> you're

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
club with you play the games you're

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.600 
club with you play the games you're
playing<00:02:40.290> you're<00:02:40.710> playing<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
playing you're playing so that the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.400 
playing you're playing so that the
clock<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.090> wind<00:02:42.390> down<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.290> are<00:02:43.380> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
clock can wind down because you are a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.830 
clock can wind down because you are a
hand<00:02:43.740> now<00:02:44.870> again<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:47.010> bench<00:02:47.280> has<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.570> right

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
hand now again the bench has the right

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.110 
hand now again the bench has the right
it<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.230> their<00:02:49.410> job<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:50.460> make<00:02:50.490> sure<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it is their job to make sure that the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.990 
it is their job to make sure that the
clock<00:02:51.450> moves<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.710> once<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> clock<00:02:53.580> does<00:02:53.790> not

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
clock moves and once the clock does not

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.820 
clock moves and once the clock does not
move<00:02:54.180> they<00:02:54.360> are<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.660> indicate<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> take<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
move they are to indicate and take it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.000 
move they are to indicate and take it
back<00:02:56.630> ok<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.110> essence<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.530> why<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> said<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
back ok so the essence of why I said I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.250 
back ok so the essence of why I said I
no<00:02:59.190> juror<00:02:59.430> was<00:02:59.670> because<00:02:59.970> simply<00:03:00.270> hey<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:01.050> guys

no juror was because simply hey you guys

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.810 
no juror was because simply hey you guys
didn't<00:03:01.560> give<00:03:01.680> us<00:03:01.800> an<00:03:01.920> advantage<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.459> you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
didn't give us an advantage because you

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.520 
didn't give us an advantage because you
have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> give<00:03:03.300> an<00:03:03.420> advantage<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.020> both<00:03:04.200> teams

the officials the referees right great
I<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.370> walk<00:03:11.610> worried<00:03:11.910> about<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.270> bench

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
I was just walk worried about the bench

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.690 
I was just walk worried about the bench
because<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.290> bench<00:03:13.530> should<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.070> charge<00:03:14.400> of

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
because the bench should be in charge of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.590 
because the bench should be in charge of
what<00:03:15.270> happens<00:03:15.709> boot<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.070> clock<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.610> on

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
what happens boot on the clock and on

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.960 
what happens boot on the clock and on
the<00:03:18.989> table<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.590> gets<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:19.980> point<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
the table it gets to this point in the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.540 
the table it gets to this point in the
game<00:03:21.090> where<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.019> coaches<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.250> a

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
game where the coaches have to do like a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.120 
game where the coaches have to do like a
substitution<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.930> put<00:03:25.170> people<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.709> he<00:03:25.920> got

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
substitution to put people that he got

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.410 
substitution to put people that he got
to<00:03:26.220> play<00:03:26.250> defense<00:03:26.400> because<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.150> people<00:03:27.269> on

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to play defense because the people on

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.440 
to play defense because the people on
the<00:03:27.540> floor<00:03:27.750> could<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.530> tired<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.160> fact<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.640> so

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the floor could be tired a fact out so

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.750 
the floor could be tired a fact out so
you<00:03:30.540> need<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.750> put<00:03:31.170> fresh<00:03:31.470> guys<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:32.340> be<00:03:32.459> for<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
you need to put fresh guys to be for the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.370 
you need to put fresh guys to be for the
defense<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.300> that's<00:03:33.630> why<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:33.930> select<00:03:34.260> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
defense I think that's why we select a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.770 
defense I think that's why we select a
little<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.800> but<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.610> think<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.269> was<00:03:36.390> corrected

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
little bit but I think it was corrected

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.110 
little bit but I think it was corrected
so<00:03:37.050> at<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> end<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.860> saw<00:03:38.040> we<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.790> won<00:03:38.940> by<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so at the end we saw we we won by a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840 
so at the end we saw we we won by a
large<00:03:39.360> margin<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.380> Comets<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.580> search

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
large margin for the Comets the search

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.990 
large margin for the Comets the search
for<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> fresh<00:03:42.510> win<00:03:42.810> over<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> Warriors

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
for a fresh win over the Warriors

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.440 
for a fresh win over the Warriors
continues

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.260
