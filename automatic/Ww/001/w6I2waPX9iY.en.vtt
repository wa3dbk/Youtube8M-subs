00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
able to do so we started noting what are

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
able to do so we started noting what are
these<00:01:39.840> things<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> he's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.220> able<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
these things that he's not able to do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.749 
these things that he's not able to do

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
because the hands won't do it not
because<00:01:45.180> he<00:01:45.390> doesn't<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.899> how<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.979> of
