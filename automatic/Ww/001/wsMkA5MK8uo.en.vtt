Borg<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:04.980> we're<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.310> cover

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
Borg in this video we're going to cover

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.350 
Borg in this video we're going to cover
how<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.210> handle<00:00:06.899> spins<00:00:07.680> heavy<00:00:08.670> spins<00:00:09.059> heavy

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
how to handle spins heavy spins heavy

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.470 
how to handle spins heavy spins heavy
slices<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.410> firstly<00:00:10.830> how<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.460> handle<00:00:11.700> deep

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
slices so firstly how do we handle deep

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.110 
slices so firstly how do we handle deep
heavy<00:00:12.870> spins<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.429> two<00:00:14.610> options<00:00:15.000> on

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
heavy spins they have two options on

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
heavy spins they have two options on
this<00:00:15.240> type<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> shot<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.470> option<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this type of shot the first option is to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.279 
this type of shot the first option is to
try<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> take<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> rise<00:00:18.420> before

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
try to take it on the rise before

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.099 
try to take it on the rise before
actually<00:00:19.920> gets<00:00:20.070> too<00:00:20.340> high<00:00:20.750> but<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
actually gets too high but this is a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.230 
actually gets too high but this is a
very<00:00:22.289> hard<00:00:22.619> option<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> something<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.029> more

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
very hard option and something that more

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
very hard option and something that more
advanced<00:00:24.600> players<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.140> try<00:00:31.369> now<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.610> will

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
advanced players will try now this will

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
advanced players will try now this will
require<00:00:33.239> great<00:00:33.750> timing<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.649> ball<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
require great timing because the ball is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.560 
require great timing because the ball is
going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> bounce<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> kick<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.910> quickly<00:00:36.239> so

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
going to bounce and kick up quickly so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.110 
going to bounce and kick up quickly so
the<00:00:37.020> margin<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> hitting<00:00:38.610> zone<00:00:38.820> will<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the margin in that hitting zone will be

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.260 
the margin in that hitting zone will be
very<00:00:39.420> small<00:00:40.280> also<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.520> depend<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> kind

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
very small also will depend on the kind

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
very small also will depend on the kind
of<00:00:42.329> surface<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> play<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.410> you're<00:00:43.530> playing

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
of surface you play on if you're playing

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
of surface you play on if you're playing
on<00:00:43.860> clay<00:00:44.160> court<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:45.030> taking<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
on clay court and you're taking that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
on clay court and you're taking that
ball<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:45.719> early<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.649> might<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> bad

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
ball very early you might get a bad

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
ball very early you might get a bad
bounce<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> might<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.480> always<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
bounce so you might not always make a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.650 
bounce so you might not always make a
good<00:00:49.200> contact<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.180> important<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
good contact so it's very important that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
good contact so it's very important that
you<00:00:51.840> adjust<00:00:51.930> yourself<00:00:52.530> depending<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.039> what

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you adjust yourself depending on what

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
you adjust yourself depending on what
court<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.059> play<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> clay<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.140> may

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
court you play on so on the clay you may

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.029 
court you play on so on the clay you may
want<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.520> deeper<00:00:57.770> now<00:00:58.770> here

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
want to go a little bit deeper now here

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
want to go a little bit deeper now here
we<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.399> Alex<00:00:59.699> taking<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> ball<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> rise

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we see Alex taking that ball on the rise

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
we see Alex taking that ball on the rise
a<00:01:01.170> few<00:01:01.620> things<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> try<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> do

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a few things that you want to try to do

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
a few things that you want to try to do
when<00:01:03.690> trying<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.439> ball<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
right is to get the racket back really

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
right is to get the racket back really
early<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.740> early<00:01:07.920> preparation<00:01:08.900> another<00:01:09.900> thing

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
early so early preparation another thing

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.390 
early so early preparation another thing
that<00:01:10.260> you'll<00:01:10.380> notice<00:01:10.500> Alex<00:01:11.010> doing<00:01:11.189> really

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that you'll notice Alex doing really

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520 
that you'll notice Alex doing really
well<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.880> putting<00:01:12.630> his<00:01:12.780> body<00:01:12.960> weight<00:01:13.200> through

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
well is putting his body weight through

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
well is putting his body weight through
the<00:01:13.560> shot<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> weight<00:01:15.270> transfer

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the shot so that so the weight transfer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560 
the shot so that so the weight transfer
through<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> ball<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.540> want

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
through the ball and if you can you want

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
through the ball and if you can you want
to<00:01:18.750> use<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> neutral<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> semi<00:01:20.189> open

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
to use the neutral or the semi open

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.480 
to use the neutral or the semi open
stance<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> type<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> ball

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.510 

now<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.299> second<00:01:25.840> option<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.350> letting<00:01:27.220> no<00:01:27.340> ball

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
now the second option is letting no ball

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.880 
now the second option is letting no ball
bounce<00:01:27.930> moving<00:01:28.930> back<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:29.470> if<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.680> was<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
bounce moving back so if this was the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.250 
bounce moving back so if this was the
baseline<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.670> might<00:01:31.240> move<00:01:31.420> back<00:01:31.659> six<00:01:31.990> or<00:01:32.110> eight

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
baseline I might move back six or eight

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.370 
baseline I might move back six or eight
feet<00:01:32.530> let<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.400> ball<00:01:33.610> go<00:01:34.360> up<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.810> his<00:01:34.930> peak<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
feet let the ball go up to his peak and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.070 
feet let the ball go up to his peak and
start<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.860> drop<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:37.210> might<00:01:37.450> hit<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.630> after

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
start to drop and I might hit it after

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:49.620 
start to drop and I might hit it after
it<00:01:38.200> starts<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.590> decelerate<00:01:48.300> now<00:01:49.300> here's<00:01:49.540> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
it starts to decelerate now here's a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.540 
it starts to decelerate now here's a
slow<00:01:49.899> motion<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.470> Alex<00:01:50.830> letting<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.310> ball

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
slow motion of Alex letting that ball

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.730 
slow motion of Alex letting that ball
drop<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.540> he's<00:01:52.659> moving<00:01:52.930> back<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.560> he's

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
drop so he's moving back and he's

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.070 
drop so he's moving back and he's
letting<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.130> ball<00:01:54.340> drop<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:55.000> big<00:01:55.720> thing<00:01:55.960> that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
letting that ball drop a big thing that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
letting that ball drop a big thing that
you<00:01:56.140> want<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.350> try<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:56.740> when<00:01:56.950> you're

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
you want to try to do when you're

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.520 
you want to try to do when you're
letting<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:58.060> ball<00:01:58.300> drop<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:59.289> want<00:01:59.470> to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
letting this ball drop is you want to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.650 
letting this ball drop is you want to
give<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.920> lot<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.369> topspin<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.450> want<00:02:01.600> to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
give it a lot of topspin you want to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.270 
give it a lot of topspin you want to
give<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.899> good<00:02:02.200> neck<00:02:02.440> clearance<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.130> give

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
give it good neck clearance to give

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.240 
give it good neck clearance to give
yourself<00:02:03.670> time<00:02:04.320> another<00:02:05.320> finger<00:02:05.710> Alex<00:02:05.950> really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
yourself time another finger Alex really

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.330 
yourself time another finger Alex really
does<00:02:06.429> well<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.910> that<00:02:07.570> full<00:02:07.869> rotation<00:02:08.619> from

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
does well is that full rotation from

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100 
does well is that full rotation from
this<00:02:09.610> position<00:02:10.119> here<00:02:10.360> notice<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
this position here notice that the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.620 
this position here notice that the
shoulders<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.950> rotate<00:02:12.370> fully<00:02:12.730> even

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
shoulders really rotate fully even

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.300 
shoulders really rotate fully even
though<00:02:13.780> his<00:02:13.959> body<00:02:13.989> weights<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.650> backwards

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
though his body weights going backwards

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.030 
though his body weights going backwards
he's<00:02:16.269> still<00:02:16.600> getting<00:02:16.930> great<00:02:17.110> rotation<00:02:17.830> from

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
he's still getting great rotation from

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
he's still getting great rotation from
the<00:02:18.190> hips<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.700> from<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.420> shoulders<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:20.019> this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the hips and from the shoulders now this

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.080 
the hips and from the shoulders now this
is<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.380> thing<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.800> they<00:02:20.890> trained<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.400> Spain

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
is a thing that they trained in Spain

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.850 
is a thing that they trained in Spain
and<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.110> want<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> try<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.709> that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and you really want to try to do that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
and you really want to try to do that
it's<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:24.880> important<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.360> with<00:02:25.569> heavy<00:02:25.840> spin

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
it's very important that with heavy spin

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's very important that with heavy spin
you<00:02:26.739> counter<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.310> heavy<00:02:27.580> spin<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.120> your<00:02:28.269> own

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
you counter the heavy spin with your own

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.720 
you counter the heavy spin with your own
spin<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.320> not<00:02:29.590> enough<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.280> put<00:02:30.610> your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
spin it's not enough just to put your

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.430 
spin it's not enough just to put your
racket<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.329> ball<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.840> let<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.230> ball<00:02:32.410> come

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
racket to the ball and let the ball come

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.110 
racket to the ball and let the ball come
off<00:02:32.769> your<00:02:32.890> strings<00:02:33.220> because<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.700> ball<00:02:33.850> will

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
off your strings because that ball will

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.940 
off your strings because that ball will
spin<00:02:34.450> off<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.290> lose<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> control

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
spin off and you will lose the control

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.770 
spin off and you will lose the control
of<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.489> you'll<00:02:36.610> actually<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.269> give<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
of it so you'll actually have to give a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.720 
of it so you'll actually have to give a
little<00:02:37.989> bit<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.320> your<00:02:38.440> own<00:02:38.620> spin<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.220> make<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
little bit of your own spin to make the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.729 
little bit of your own spin to make the
ball<00:02:39.940> go<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.450> direction<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.470> way<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
ball go the direction and the way that

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.069 
ball go the direction and the way that
you<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.220> not<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.700> react<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.660> roof<00:02:43.810> in

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
you want not just react to the roof in

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.930 
you want not just react to the roof in
that's<00:02:44.260> come<00:02:44.440> at<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.739> now<00:02:45.549> I'll<00:02:45.700> show<00:02:45.880> you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
that's come at you now I'll show you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
that's come at you now I'll show you
what<00:02:46.150> happens<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.600> don't<00:02:46.870> counter<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
what happens if you don't counter the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.220 
what happens if you don't counter the
spin<00:02:47.860> with<00:02:48.370> your<00:02:48.400> own<00:02:48.610> spin<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.019> ball

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
spin with your own spin so this ball

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.770 
spin with your own spin so this ball
should<00:02:50.530> fly<00:02:51.310> off<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:51.640> racket<00:02:52.090> without<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
should fly off my racket without the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:05.930 
should fly off my racket without the
control<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.560> want<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.220> hit<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.459> shot

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.759 

now<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.150> when<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.569> just<00:03:07.870> touched<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.319> ball<00:03:08.530> it

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
now that when I just touched the ball it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.589 
now that when I just touched the ball it
spins<00:03:09.160> off<00:03:09.310> my<00:03:09.489> strings<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.060> don't<00:03:10.269> get<00:03:10.420> any

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
spins off my strings and I don't get any

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.360 
spins off my strings and I don't get any
control<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:11.830> very<00:03:11.950> important

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
control on it so it's very important

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.740 
control on it so it's very important
that<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.519> actually<00:03:12.730> accelerate<00:03:13.360> through<00:03:13.629> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
that I actually accelerate through it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.110 
that I actually accelerate through it
and<00:03:13.930> give<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.080> my<00:03:14.260> own<00:03:14.440> power<00:03:14.709> my<00:03:14.980> own<00:03:15.099> speed

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.280 

it's<00:03:19.120> very<00:03:19.299> important<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.810> when<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.049> do

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
it's very important that when you do

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.770 
it's very important that when you do
move<00:03:20.590> back<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.340> spin<00:03:21.640> shot<00:03:21.910> it's

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
move back for that spin shot it's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.750 
move back for that spin shot it's
important<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.650> height<00:03:24.069> over

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
important that you get this height over

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.309 
important that you get this height over
the<00:03:24.849> net<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.330> make<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> ball<00:03:25.959> go<00:03:26.110> deep

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
the net to make the ball go deep

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.390 
the net to make the ball go deep
otherwise<00:03:26.709> you're<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.040> hit<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> lot<00:03:27.370> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
otherwise you're going to hit a lot of

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.339 
otherwise you're going to hit a lot of
short<00:03:27.730> balls<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.480> you're<00:03:28.690> moving<00:03:28.780> backwards

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
short balls if you're moving backwards

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.350 
short balls if you're moving backwards
from<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.709> spin<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.610> actually<00:03:30.970> just<00:03:31.060> hitting

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
from that spin and actually just hitting

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.930 
from that spin and actually just hitting
the<00:03:31.420> same<00:03:31.630> shot<00:03:31.900> now<00:03:32.799> how<00:03:32.980> do<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.160> handle<00:03:33.400> slice

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the same shot now how do we handle slice

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.050 
the same shot now how do we handle slice
a<00:03:34.380> heavy<00:03:35.380> slice<00:03:35.739> will<00:03:36.220> usually<00:03:36.400> die<00:03:36.819> down

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
a heavy slice will usually die down

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.520 
a heavy slice will usually die down
he'll<00:03:37.299> stay<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.569> little<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:37.930> lower<00:03:38.230> than<00:03:38.349> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
he'll stay a little bit lower than a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.770 
he'll stay a little bit lower than a
spin<00:03:38.829> because<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.250> ball<00:03:39.430> has<00:03:39.849> this<00:03:40.060> backwards

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
spin because the ball has this backwards

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.960 
spin because the ball has this backwards
rotation<00:03:41.349> on<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.950> will<00:03:42.099> slow<00:03:42.459> down<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
rotation on it it will slow down so you

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.000 
rotation on it it will slow down so you
have<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> be<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.329> lot<00:03:43.540> closer<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.200> ball<00:03:44.470> you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
have to be a lot closer to the ball you

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.369 
have to be a lot closer to the ball you
have<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.280> be<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> lot<00:03:45.640> lower<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.299> ball<00:03:46.480> and

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
have to be a lot lower to the ball and

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.199 
have to be a lot lower to the ball and
then<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.590> again<00:03:48.129> will<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.640> counter<00:03:49.060> it

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
then you again will have to counter it

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.539 
then you again will have to counter it
with<00:03:49.360> your<00:03:49.780> own<00:03:49.870> spin<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.650> lift<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.220> ball<00:03:51.400> over

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
with your own spin to lift the ball over

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.880 
with your own spin to lift the ball over
the<00:03:51.760> net<00:03:51.790> now<00:03:52.780> if<00:03:52.930> any<00:03:53.110> shot<00:03:53.349> in<00:03:53.470> tennis<00:03:53.620> is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
the net now if any shot in tennis is

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.170 
the net now if any shot in tennis is
very<00:03:54.069> important<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:54.670> see<00:03:54.819> what<00:03:55.000> your

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
very important to see what your

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.180 
very important to see what your
opponent's<00:03:55.599> racket<00:03:55.959> is<00:03:56.049> doing<00:03:56.410> at<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.010> time

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
opponent's racket is doing at the time

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.520 
opponent's racket is doing at the time
of<00:03:57.370> contact<00:03:57.610> if<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.569> racket<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:58.959> going<00:03:58.989> slow

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
of contact if the racket is going slow

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.559 
of contact if the racket is going slow
the<00:04:00.280> effect<00:04:00.610> on<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.819> ball<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.120> probably<00:04:01.420> not

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
the effect on the ball is probably not

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.390 
the effect on the ball is probably not
going<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.019> heavy<00:04:02.260> if<00:04:03.069> it's<00:04:03.250> going

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
going to be that heavy if it's going

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.009 
going to be that heavy if it's going
really<00:04:03.670> quick<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.359> can<00:04:04.630> see<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
really quick and you can see that the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.720 
really quick and you can see that the
ball<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.739> rack<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.100> traveling<00:04:06.459> up<00:04:06.549> at<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
ball the rack is traveling up at the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.280 
ball the rack is traveling up at the
back<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.090> ball<00:04:07.239> like<00:04:07.269> this<00:04:07.420> really<00:04:08.019> quick

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
back of the ball like this really quick

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.319 
back of the ball like this really quick
the<00:04:09.040> spin<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:09.459> going<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.790> much<00:04:09.970> greater

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
the spin is going to be much greater

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.170 
the spin is going to be much greater
than<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:11.049> slow<00:04:11.290> traveling<00:04:11.769> bakit<00:04:12.130> you'll<00:04:13.000> have

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
than a slow traveling bakit you'll have

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.030 
than a slow traveling bakit you'll have
to<00:04:13.299> make<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.630> correct<00:04:13.959> adjustment<00:04:14.590> depending

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
to make the correct adjustment depending

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.680 
to make the correct adjustment depending
on<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> kind<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.549> shot<00:04:15.880> that<00:04:16.299> is<00:04:16.389> going<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.599> be

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
on the kind of shot that is going to be

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.930 
on the kind of shot that is going to be
coming<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.260> if<00:04:17.829> for<00:04:18.070> example<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.579> see<00:04:18.789> my

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
coming so if for example I see my

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.300 
coming so if for example I see my
opponent<00:04:19.620> swinging<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.709> racket<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.160> then

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
opponent swinging the racket and then

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.420 
opponent swinging the racket and then
using<00:04:21.880> this<00:04:22.380> across<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.590> ball<00:04:23.770> motion<00:04:24.280> I'll

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
using this across the ball motion I'll

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.770 
using this across the ball motion I'll
know<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.060> ball<00:04:25.210> is<00:04:25.240> actually<00:04:25.450> going<00:04:25.690> to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
know that the ball is actually going to

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.409 
know that the ball is actually going to
be<00:04:25.900> spinning<00:04:26.680> while<00:04:26.919> slicing<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.610> little<00:04:28.300> bit

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
be spinning while slicing a little bit

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.790 
be spinning while slicing a little bit
more<00:04:28.570> sideways<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.289> I'm<00:04:29.380> going<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.530> have<00:04:29.710> to

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
more sideways so I'm going to have to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.560 
more sideways so I'm going to have to
adjust<00:04:30.099> my<00:04:30.280> position<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:30.880> not<00:04:31.000> stand<00:04:31.360> so

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
adjust my position and not stand so

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.450 
adjust my position and not stand so
close<00:04:31.599> to<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.080> ball<00:04:32.229> perhaps<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:32.800> actually

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
close to the ball perhaps and actually

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.029 
close to the ball perhaps and actually
look<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.930> almost<00:04:34.930> anticipate<00:04:35.229> where<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:35.919> ball

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
look to almost anticipate where the ball

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.400 
look to almost anticipate where the ball
will<00:04:36.430> bounce<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.419> get<00:04:38.020> myself<00:04:38.200> prepared

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
will bounce to and get myself prepared

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.350 
will bounce to and get myself prepared
in<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.889> position<00:04:39.190> rather<00:04:39.760> than<00:04:39.880> standing

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
in that position rather than standing

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.180 
in that position rather than standing
next<00:04:40.539> to<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.780> bounce<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.590> lot<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.919> times

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
next to the bounce so a lot of the times

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.300 
next to the bounce so a lot of the times
I<00:04:42.490> see<00:04:43.030> where<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.740> recreational<00:04:44.740> players<00:04:45.010> is

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
I see where the recreational players is

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.219 
I see where the recreational players is
they<00:04:46.030> actually<00:04:46.330> stand<00:04:46.539> next<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> bounce

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
they actually stand next to the bounce

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.550 
they actually stand next to the bounce
and<00:04:47.530> don't<00:04:47.770> take<00:04:48.150> into<00:04:49.150> account<00:04:49.410> well<00:04:50.410> then

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
and don't take into account well then

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.870 
and don't take into account well then
take<00:04:50.740> into<00:04:51.010> consideration

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
take into consideration

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.150 
take into consideration
the<00:04:52.120> spin<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.229> their<00:04:53.410> partner<00:04:53.680> has<00:04:53.710> put<00:04:54.039> on

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
the spin that their partner has put on

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.680 
the spin that their partner has put on
or<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.490> slice<00:04:54.789> that<00:04:54.970> they've<00:04:55.120> put<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.360> or<00:04:55.599> the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
or the slice that they've put on or the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.510 
or the slice that they've put on or the
side<00:04:55.990> spin<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.410> they<00:04:56.530> put<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:57.340> it's<00:04:57.430> very

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
side spin that they put on so it's very

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.490 
side spin that they put on so it's very
important<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.060> adjust<00:04:58.210> your<00:04:58.630> positioning<00:04:59.380> on

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
important to adjust your positioning on

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.560 
important to adjust your positioning on
the<00:04:59.560> court<00:04:59.800> depending<00:05:00.160> on<00:05:00.430> how<00:05:00.639> they've<00:05:01.180> swung

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the court depending on how they've swung

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.909 
the court depending on how they've swung
that<00:05:01.720> racket<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.200> how<00:05:02.320> they've<00:05:02.500> hit<00:05:02.710> through

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
that racket and how they've hit through

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.159 
that racket and how they've hit through
that<00:05:03.070> shot<00:05:03.450> now<00:05:04.450> this<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.810> something<00:05:04.990> that

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
that shot now this is something that

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.110 
that shot now this is something that
you'll<00:05:05.320> see<00:05:05.590> if<00:05:05.890> you're<00:05:06.400> tracking<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:06.940> ball

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
you'll see if you're tracking the ball

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.360 
you'll see if you're tracking the ball
well<00:05:07.719> you<00:05:08.349> don't<00:05:08.469> have<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.800> watch<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.130> player

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
well you don't have to watch the player

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.050 
well you don't have to watch the player
all<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.669> time

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
all the time

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.800 
all the time
obviously<00:05:10.510> the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
obviously the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.450 
obviously the
was<00:05:10.960> more<00:05:11.139> important<00:05:11.560> than<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.740> Fleur<00:05:11.950> but

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
was more important than the Fleur but

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460

you'll<00:05:12.639> see<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.090> contact<00:05:13.630> how<00:05:13.900> their<00:05:14.139> racket

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
you'll see it contact how their racket

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.860 
you'll see it contact how their racket
is<00:05:14.590> moving<00:05:14.770> from<00:05:15.760> your<00:05:15.850> vision<00:05:16.210> if<00:05:16.540> you're

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
is moving from your vision if you're

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.810 
is moving from your vision if you're
watching<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:17.320> ball<00:05:17.500> correctly<00:05:17.980> now<00:05:18.760> the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
watching that ball correctly now the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.550 
watching that ball correctly now the
more<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.600> easier<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.230> will<00:05:20.290> become

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
more you do it the easier it will become

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.040 
more you do it the easier it will become
and<00:05:21.040> after<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> while<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.480> won't<00:05:22.660> even<00:05:22.720> have<00:05:22.930> to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
and after a while you won't even have to

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.510 
and after a while you won't even have to
think<00:05:23.080> about<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.680> you'll<00:05:23.889> actually<00:05:24.010> see<00:05:24.370> the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
think about it you'll actually see the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.770 
think about it you'll actually see the
way<00:05:24.639> your<00:05:24.820> pone<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.150> hitting<00:05:25.450> it<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.660> you'll

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
way your pone is hitting it and you'll

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.260 
way your pone is hitting it and you'll
react<00:05:26.110> instantly<00:05:26.710> but<00:05:27.430> until<00:05:27.790> then<00:05:27.970> it's<00:05:28.180> very

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
react instantly but until then it's very

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.210 
react instantly but until then it's very
important<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.810> you<00:05:28.930> really<00:05:29.500> pay<00:05:29.740> attention

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
important that you really pay attention

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:39.620 
important that you really pay attention
and<00:05:30.310> start<00:05:30.669> making<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.060> correct<00:05:31.389> decisions

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.690 

now<00:05:40.630> notice<00:05:41.080> in<00:05:41.230> this<00:05:41.410> clip<00:05:41.680> how<00:05:41.830> low<00:05:42.250> Alex

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
now notice in this clip how low Alex

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.969 
now notice in this clip how low Alex
gets<00:05:43.060> with<00:05:43.450> his<00:05:43.600> body<00:05:43.900> look<00:05:44.530> at<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.740> knee<00:05:44.950> bend

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
gets with his body look at the knee bend

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.370 
gets with his body look at the knee bend
right<00:05:45.400> here<00:05:45.820> now<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:46.510> is<00:05:46.660> crucial<00:05:46.960> when

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
right here now this is crucial when

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.700 
right here now this is crucial when
handling<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:48.040> slice

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.219 

on<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:51.039> one<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:52.150> can<00:05:52.660> see<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.050> ball<00:05:53.199> is

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
on that one you can see that the ball is

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.779 
on that one you can see that the ball is
going<00:05:53.320> to<00:05:53.470> go<00:05:53.560> really<00:05:53.800> low<00:05:54.130> because<00:05:54.370> Simon

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
going to go really low because Simon

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.360 
going to go really low because Simon
really<00:05:55.060> sliced<00:05:55.990> through<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.560> shot<00:05:57.039> forward

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
really sliced through the shot forward

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.219 
really sliced through the shot forward
and<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:58.030> balls<00:05:58.240> going<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.570> quite<00:05:58.840> low<00:05:59.050> over

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
and the balls going to quite low over

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:00.570 
and the balls going to quite low over
the<00:05:59.259> net<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.560> knew<00:05:59.860> the<00:06:00.009> bounce<00:06:00.220> is<00:06:00.370> going<00:06:00.520> to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
the net and knew the bounce is going to

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.610 
the net and knew the bounce is going to
be<00:06:00.669> low<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.090> I<00:06:01.419> needed<00:06:01.660> to<00:06:01.840> get<00:06:01.990> close<00:06:02.380> as<00:06:02.590> I

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
be low and I needed to get close as I

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.379 
be low and I needed to get close as I
can<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.919> that<00:06:03.220> ball<00:06:03.400> so<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.610> could<00:06:03.850> spin<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.300> over

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
can to that ball so I could spin it over

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:11.610 
can to that ball so I could spin it over
the<00:06:04.600> net<00:06:08.880> now<00:06:09.880> notice<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.419> this<00:06:10.539> clip<00:06:10.840> how<00:06:11.199> Alex

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
the net now notice in this clip how Alex

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.529 
the net now notice in this clip how Alex
gives<00:06:11.860> himself<00:06:12.039> a<00:06:12.370> lot<00:06:12.520> of<00:06:12.639> space<00:06:12.940> away<00:06:13.360> from

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
gives himself a lot of space away from

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.510 
gives himself a lot of space away from
the<00:06:13.630> ball<00:06:13.840> it<00:06:14.350> doesn't<00:06:14.560> go<00:06:14.770> too<00:06:14.830> close<00:06:15.190> to<00:06:15.430> the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
the ball it doesn't go too close to the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.640 
the ball it doesn't go too close to the
bounce<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:16.030> this<00:06:16.660> gives<00:06:16.930> him<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.320> space<00:06:17.620> to

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
bounce and this gives him the space to

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.850 
bounce and this gives him the space to
adjust

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.129 

now<00:06:24.729> that<00:06:25.060> one<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:25.360> could<00:06:25.509> see<00:06:25.720> that<00:06:25.840> the<00:06:25.960> ball

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
now that one you could see that the ball

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.659 
now that one you could see that the ball
is<00:06:26.229> going<00:06:26.349> to<00:06:26.440> move<00:06:26.560> more<00:06:27.190> to<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:27.490> right

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
is going to move more to the right

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.219 
is going to move more to the right
because<00:06:27.819> I<00:06:28.060> could<00:06:28.210> see<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.449> side<00:06:28.810> spin<00:06:29.110> the

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
because I could see the side spin the

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.200 
because I could see the side spin the
summons<00:06:29.590> putting<00:06:29.860> on<00:06:29.979> it<00:06:30.129> so<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.550> took<00:06:30.639> just<00:06:31.060> my

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
summons putting on it so I took just my

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.879 
summons putting on it so I took just my
positioning<00:06:31.780> actually<00:06:32.379> stand<00:06:32.620> a<00:06:32.710> little<00:06:32.770> bit

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
positioning actually stand a little bit

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.290 
positioning actually stand a little bit
further<00:06:33.190> to<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.490> right<00:06:33.639> so<00:06:33.849> they<00:06:33.940> could<00:06:34.120> hit

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
further to the right so they could hit

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:47.650 
further to the right so they could hit
that<00:06:34.449> shot<00:06:34.690> effectively

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.330 

now<00:06:48.660> on<00:06:48.780> that<00:06:48.900> last<00:06:49.139> one<00:06:49.470> Simon<00:06:49.889> had<00:06:50.160> this

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
now on that last one Simon had this

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.550 
now on that last one Simon had this
reverse<00:06:50.730> spear<00:06:51.060> on<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.240> forehand<00:06:51.600> and<00:06:52.290> again

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
reverse spear on the forehand and again

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.140 
reverse spear on the forehand and again
I<00:06:52.590> had<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:52.889> adjust<00:06:52.980> my<00:06:53.220> positioning<00:06:53.790> this<00:06:53.880> time

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
I had to adjust my positioning this time

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.969 
I had to adjust my positioning this time
standing<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:54.990> little<00:06:55.230> bit<00:06:55.350> further<00:06:55.620> to<00:06:55.740> the

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
standing a little bit further to the

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.640 
standing a little bit further to the
left<00:06:56.220> and<00:06:56.520> again<00:06:57.389> in<00:06:57.660> this<00:06:57.780> clip<00:06:58.080> noticed<00:06:58.500> that

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
left and again in this clip noticed that

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.710 
left and again in this clip noticed that
Alex<00:06:58.919> gives<00:06:59.160> himself<00:06:59.340> a<00:06:59.699> lot<00:06:59.910> of<00:07:00.030> space<00:07:00.330> away

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
Alex gives himself a lot of space away

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.170 
Alex gives himself a lot of space away
from<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:01.050> ball<00:07:01.229> away<00:07:01.680> from<00:07:01.919> that<00:07:02.250> bounce<00:07:02.520> so

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
from the ball away from that bounce so

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.390 
from the ball away from that bounce so
he<00:07:03.330> can<00:07:03.479> adjust<00:07:03.600> for<00:07:04.500> the<00:07:04.620> different<00:07:05.010> types<00:07:05.220> of

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
he can adjust for the different types of

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.629 
he can adjust for the different types of
spin<00:07:05.699> that<00:07:05.910> I'm<00:07:06.030> giving<00:07:06.360> him

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:11.460
