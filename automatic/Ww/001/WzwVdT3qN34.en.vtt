00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.880

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.370
 this file will appear what you have to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 to do is extract what you have here extract 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 in cinema and you wait a bit 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 [Music] 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.380
 as never before 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.330
 or not 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.460
 one 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:15.079
 how 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.079
 [Music] 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.470
 one 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 two 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.729
 two 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.729
 very well once extracted we will appear 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.940
 we opened this folder and we 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.560
 we will find 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.370
 these four files in principle is not 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.260
 necessary 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.410
 serial but good I always leave it 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.150
 in case you have a problem or something and 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.070
 very important this little guide of 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.700
 installation in which will come any 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 information or if you miss any step 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.910
 and you want to check it again 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.590
 very well the first thing you have to do 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:19.000
 copy the cinema 4d folder we copy and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.020
 preferably we go to the file team 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.280
 of the program and we paste it 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:30.459
 [Music] 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.079
 it's a portable edition you can have 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.689
 that's why I usually install it from this 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.720
 form or you can have it on a pendrive and 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.939
 execute it from the pendrive 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.939
 [Music] 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.710
 [Music] 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.940
 the world 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.870
 [Music] 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.860
 or not 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.650
 one 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.360
 [Music] 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.610
 [Music] 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.270
 no no no 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.270
 i 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.750
 once copied we open and execute 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.350
 the very important edit file 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.350
 open it 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.209
 we accept the modification in the registry 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.750
 and once this is done we are going to this 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.340
 cinema folder 4d between 14 and according to the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.730
 version that we have of the system 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.680
 operative we create a shortcut 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.360
 I in my case have a 64 system 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.110
 bits and I'll create the shortcut of the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.190
 cinema file 4 64 bits 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.710
 we give you right click 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.710
 and create direct access 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.710
 [Music] 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.960
 we already have direct access in the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.039
 if you have a version of 32 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.720
 bits is this down here the file 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.720
 that you have to do the shortcut 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 very well then here we have the program 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.250
 we open it 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.350
 do not 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.380
 and here we have it 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.720
 very well then now what we have to 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:39.330
 to do is to update it, we are going to help 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.330
 check for updates and we hope 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.240
 a combo 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.960
 [Music] 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.360
 well in principle there is no 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.700
 update available this is something 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.650
 optional and well this has been all 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.140
