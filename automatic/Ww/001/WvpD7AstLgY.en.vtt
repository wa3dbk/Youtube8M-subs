00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 hi very good guys and girls tommy 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 addicts finally I have a little bit to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 mount one of the videos that I already had 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 recorded before my activity in the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.349
 channel were practically nil 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.529
 I wanted to ask you in the first place for forgiveness 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.640
 but I've been very involved and the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340
 truth is that every time I'm having 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 less time to devote to the game 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.849
 conclusion every time I am more bad playing 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 but good 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 how I like it so much because I know I have 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.140
 a quick matrix I try to dedicate it and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.580
 good this video I wanted to explain how 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.930
 we can ride the plane in on the mode 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.760
 dead I imagine that most already 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.989
 you will know how to mount it and others but good 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.990
 I have no engraving of the first 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.630
 games that we miss 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.460
 and as repeating myself again I have already 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.840
 said that I have very little time then 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.160
 I'm going to take advantage of the ones I already had for 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.740
 have done at the time that I have not 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.210
 could do and upload it and superman and 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.080
 good in this case here you have seen that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.910
 there was the key 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.860
 you know you have to wear monster life 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.930
 to be able to catch it through the hole 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.160
 up and here to open the door 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.740
 from the laundry and take the first 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.090
 color piece boys key and good 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.620
 once we have the key and already 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.270
 we have opened the laundry door 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.820
 let's take the first piece to 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.990
 ride the plane you know that the pieces 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 of the plane are always in the same 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.100
 location here we're going to have to open 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.440
 the door with the key disque is my 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.869
 double compi is seen opening and there's the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.220
 washing machine here we're going to have the first 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.710
 piece we have to activate the power 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.710
 first here I put myself in light 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.560
 to be able to energize it here and activate 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 the washing-machine 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.740
 and once the power is activated 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.310
 we are going to be able to activate the washing machine 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.500
 You see here we give it to you there and it will come out 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 the first bluetooth 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.550
 and once the washing machine is finished 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.040
 supposedly to wash we can pick up 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.260
 a kind of piece a shirt or something 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.400
 A) Yes 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.380
 we already have the first piece 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.540
 then the next one is going to be here in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.030
 you know what is going through the zip line or 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.740
 going down 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.830
 we here in this case we have gone with 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.680
 the zip line I start to do live and there 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.420
 two doors when you activate the power it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.160
 close the beginning of this we have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.990
 open here now will give 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.370
 closes here with which I just 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.319
 pass and it opens these two has to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.970
 have a complicated friend 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.100
 to open it 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.040
 hack he showed me a trick that 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.760
 I still do not really know how to make him 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.080
 gave energy to this without having to open 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.000
 the two doors or that there is nobody 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.290
 I just do not know how he did it but 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.620
 I left the two open 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.180
 You will explain it to me and I will pass it on to you 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.270
 visit your channel that surely what 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 have hung and good once it 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.370
 we have those first pieces we upload them 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.670
 to put here in society 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 here is where the plane is mounted 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.959
 I bet my bought the first piece myself 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.670
 I put the next one and we are left with only 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.379
 three one that we just caught here 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.540
 down which is where the dog is once 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.430
 that we already have the three assembled we 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.870
 we go to the tunnels the catacombs or 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.420
 how do you want to call them the bottom part 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.980
 you already know and well here going down the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.260
 stairs you know that one of the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.689
 pieces 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.129
 to catch it we have to go up 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.790
 down the spiral and open with the key 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.790
 in the grid 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.099
 and once we have it open 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.099
 we can go live 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.050
 let's see some numbers on the walls 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.190
 here when I go down you see until the 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.420
 number five 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.209
 the number 8 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.950
 and number one and once we mark 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.350
 these numbers here in this panel 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.200
 electric 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.450
 the piece will go down and go 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.550
 to be able to catch in this case like I am 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.980
 dialing the numbers my partner is going to 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.980
 take the piece we already have the penultimate 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.180
 and the last piece 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.490
 we already have here where the jail in the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.870
 garden office must be put in 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.270
 make them to open that door too 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.110
 you have to climb up here, this is good 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.600
 It's fatal and once I get there 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.910
 upstairs, nothing is to electrify the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.519
 picture this one 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.129
 over here there's another one that runs 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.919
 and well this piece is not caught opening 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:28.289
 this but as playing this game no 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.249
 we still knew it because they had to go 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.559
 a couple of classmates 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.949
 so it is for the pictures that are below 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:39.649
 is the third dog that comes with the 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.809
 zip line or through the tunnels 

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:44.059
 and it's where the titan is a door that 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.639
 you have to open and pay and you have to be 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:48.139
 like three panels or four and once 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.909
 you have it that box opens that 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.189
 We have seen and can do the account 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.459
 think move here we have already assembled the 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.459
 airplane 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.100
 and we ride on it 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.550
 Once the plane 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.139
 let's end the bridge good as we already 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.199
 I have told you in this video I have taken it 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.550
 this tutorial has not been recorded with the 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.580
 intention that it be fire tutorial 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.190
 in spaces that we recorded and maybe not 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.800
 everything is clear that I would like to 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.500
 I like it to be complicated that we want 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.540
 the four always playing faithful to do the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 tutorial well it requires a lot of time 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.950
 night then good I hope it serves you 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.530
 of something you are going to see now how it jumps 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.530
 I think so what where nobody 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.590
 escapes with life there in the corner of the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.210
 right 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.460
 I already commented is like the first the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.070
 second game that we would play the truth 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:00.520
 is that we love the map and good 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:03.470
 Well, we'll see if you take time 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.930
 I can count the videos better 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.430
 to me especially the tutorials that I 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.430
 missing by the social map 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.960
 this one that I have not played almost anything and good 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.760
 already as I have told you some 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.090
 I would love to be able to make games with the 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.330
 Subscribers to be able to raise their hands 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.890
 the rays of all not sure 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.640
 it's cool and good , we'll see it 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.640
 very strong greeting
