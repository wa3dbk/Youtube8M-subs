00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 no tail 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.460
 not all daredevils come in two 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.799
 paws the four-year partner of the kingdom 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.599
 united- a tightrope walker who challenges the 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.490
 death this starts as something pretty 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 simple a dog with two legs in the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 rope is not so impressive 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.029
 and then jump on the rope 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.619
 he is an amazing dog and tightrope walker 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.170
 who does not want to see a dog doing 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.640
 balancing on a tightrope 'is a 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.110
 dog with four legs doing 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.380
 balance on a rope I was 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.210
 amazed then he stands up 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.820
 how can you do balance in two 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.980
 legs on a rope being a dog 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.050
 good question then we travel to 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.210
 norwich england to meet ozzy a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.100
 your best friend nick johnson and discover 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.620
 a little more I like to see him do 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 balance and he does it so that I 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.780
 can see so we 're both in 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.550
 our element this is an example of 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.370
 a dog doing balance in a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.100
 string or is an example of this subject 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.320
 demonstrating his powers yeray is no 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 Jedi teacher or maybe there's something of 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.580
 science in play here this is a task 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.260
 difficult for a dog do not have the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.540
 anatomy of animals that live in 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.180
 trees limbs long hands 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.700
 adherents like primates or tails 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.160
 prehensile this dog has nothing of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.710
 that like us when we swing 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.290
 tightrope 'must distribute the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.720
 weight as far as possible from the center 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.330
 gravity of center of pivot point 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.580
 I do it when you stretch your tail all 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.490
 what can and should do many adjustments 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 tiny to stay aligned for 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.569
 that its center of mass is on the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.100
 rope has nothing in its favor but 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.720
 he also succeeds 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.240
 and many dogs in the world that can 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.590
 do that as he did use and to bark 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.020
 them in the face to the laws of the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.680
 biology and physics and achieve this act 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.090
 spectacular balance is a feat 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.310
 surprising the owner must first have 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.770
 an intelligent race is a dog 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.750
 worker and tend to be bright and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.030
 the second he trained him with a series 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.460
 of rewards he got it ready or if not 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 he knows well what he will receive but he knows what 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.550
 will happen and that will be good 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.130
 catch it 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.020
 then I will try to break the record 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.930
 world of the longest walk in a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.380
 loose rope for a dog or if you 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.380
 we say hello
