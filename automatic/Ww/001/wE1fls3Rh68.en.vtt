drive and have this ambition there is a
natural<00:01:33.270> energy<00:01:33.749> that<00:01:33.959> emerges<00:01:34.499> and<00:01:35.060> all<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
natural energy that emerges and all we

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.559 
natural energy that emerges and all we
can<00:01:36.539> see<00:01:36.929> is<00:01:37.319> this<00:01:37.679> end<00:01:38.009> goal<00:01:38.249> and<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
can see is this end goal and that I

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.489 
can see is this end goal and that I
think<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.549> evolves<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.479> does<00:01:42.779> then<00:01:43.079> evolved

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
think then evolves it does then evolved

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.559 
think then evolves it does then evolved
from<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.039> initially<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
from like initially this got kind of

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.229 
from like initially this got kind of
instinct<00:01:46.289> that's<00:01:46.560> Mason<00:01:47.159> mainly<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.819> think<00:01:48.090> for

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:48.239 
instinct that's Mason mainly I think for

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.749 
instinct that's Mason mainly I think for
me<00:01:48.359> was<00:01:48.509> based<00:01:48.719> on<00:01:48.869> survival<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> however

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
me was based on survival but however

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.459 
me was based on survival but however
what<00:01:51.179> starts<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.509> happen<00:01:51.599> is<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.139> start<00:01:52.319> to

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
what starts to happen is we start to

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.830 
what starts to happen is we start to
build<00:01:52.619> trust<00:01:52.739> I<00:01:53.369> also<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:54.029> how<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> trust

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
build trust I also know how to trust

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.139

information a little differently what
are<00:02:46.660> we<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.049> drawn<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.769> that

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
are we going to be drawn to all that

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.370 
are we going to be drawn to all that
what<00:02:48.640> are<00:02:48.700> we<00:02:48.730> going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.030> pulled<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.660> we

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
what are we going to be pulled to we

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.900 
what are we going to be pulled to we
always<00:02:50.680> think<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.250> more<00:02:51.280> than<00:02:51.489> we<00:02:51.700> can

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
always think we can do more than we can

always think we can do more than we can
and<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:52.959> women<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:54.040> maybe<00:02:54.790> more

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
and I think women do that maybe more

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.030 
and I think women do that maybe more
than<00:02:55.239> men<00:02:55.420> i'm<00:02:55.630> not<00:02:55.900> sure<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:56.350> that's<00:02:56.650> been<00:02:56.890> my

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
than men i'm not sure but that's been my

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.059

women having their own businesses i feel

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.069 
women having their own businesses i feel
that<00:03:11.250> businesses<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:13.120> responsibility<00:03:13.780> to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
that businesses have a responsibility to

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.319 
that businesses have a responsibility to
their<00:03:14.200> community<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.890> don't<00:03:15.609> know<00:03:15.760> why<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.000> feel

this<00:03:16.480> way<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.989> don't<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.470> where<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.859> came<00:03:18.070> from

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
this way I don't know where it came from

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.819 
this way I don't know where it came from
I<00:03:18.609> think<00:03:19.000> my<00:03:19.239> mother<00:03:19.480> had<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.900> lot<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.620> do<00:03:20.799> with

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
I think my mother had a lot to do with

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.830 
I think my mother had a lot to do with
that<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.400> some<00:03:21.670> level<00:03:21.700> because<00:03:22.540> she<00:03:22.720> was

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that on some level because she was

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.780 
that on some level because she was
always<00:03:23.019> generous<00:03:23.500> with<00:03:23.920> those<00:03:24.130> around<00:03:24.459> her

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
always generous with those around her

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.289 
always generous with those around her
and<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.510> feel<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.560> have<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.459> opportunity

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
and I feel that I have the opportunity

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.539 
and I feel that I have the opportunity
based<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.140> any<00:03:29.290> kind<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.709> success<00:03:29.980> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
based on any kind of success a

America<00:03:54.370> has<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.420> we<00:03:55.720> are<00:03:55.840> very<00:03:56.319> lucky

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
America has that we are very lucky

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.759 
America has that we are very lucky
nation<00:03:57.370> we<00:03:57.850> think<00:03:58.150> about<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.569> lot<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.200> in

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
nation we think about that a lot and in

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.099 
nation we think about that a lot and in
China<00:04:00.220> maybe<00:04:01.000> they<00:04:01.209> were<00:04:01.269> learning<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.079> I

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
China maybe they were learning and I

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.479 
China maybe they were learning and I
think<00:04:02.319> they<00:04:02.440> are<00:04:02.620> learning<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.310> our

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
think they are learning and so our

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.030 
think they are learning and so our
facility<00:04:04.150> now<00:04:04.329> thinks<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.170> giving<00:04:05.500> back

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
facility now thinks of giving back

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.589 
facility now thinks of giving back
and<00:04:06.159> they<00:04:06.790> feel<00:04:07.060> good<00:04:07.239> about<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:13.000> something

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
and they feel good about it so something

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
let me think about it maybe it's not a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.740
