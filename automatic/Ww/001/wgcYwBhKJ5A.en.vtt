and J easy to useful with the Douro

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.329 
and J easy to useful with the Douro
easy<00:00:12.749> to<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.019> phone<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.829> can<00:00:13.919> see<00:00:14.099> they're

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
easy to use phone so you can see they're

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.120 
easy to use phone so you can see they're
basically<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.329> same<00:00:15.650> size<00:00:16.650> although

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
basically about the same size although

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.749 
basically about the same size although
the<00:00:17.609> Dora<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.660> bit<00:00:18.810> thinner<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.919> I

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
the Dora is a little bit thinner and I

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.079 
the Dora is a little bit thinner and I
would<00:00:20.910> say<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.179> looks<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.660> bit<00:00:21.869> sleeker

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
would say it looks a little bit sleeker

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.439 
would say it looks a little bit sleeker
now<00:00:24.089> let's<00:00:24.480> open<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.259> and<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.919> can<00:00:26.099> see

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
now let's open it up and you can see

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.169 
now let's open it up and you can see
they<00:00:27.449> both<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.230> large<00:00:28.679> keypad<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.699> would

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they both have a large keypad I would

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
they both have a large keypad I would
say<00:00:30.419> that<00:00:30.769> they're<00:00:31.769> both<00:00:31.949> pretty<00:00:32.279> distinct

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
say that they're both pretty distinct

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.869 
say that they're both pretty distinct
but<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.829> Jitterbug<00:00:34.829> J's<00:00:35.100> keypad<00:00:35.699> is

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
but that the Jitterbug J's keypad is

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.189 
but that the Jitterbug J's keypad is
actually<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.449> bit<00:00:36.600> easier<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> use

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
actually a little bit easier to use

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.560 
actually a little bit easier to use
because<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> round<00:00:38.910> buttons<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.539> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
because of the round buttons with a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
because of the round buttons with a
slight<00:00:39.899> depression<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:41.190> them<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
slight depression on them so that you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840 
slight depression on them so that you
can<00:00:42.120> find<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.780> easily<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.859> hands<00:00:44.250> but

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
can find them easily with your hands but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.599 
can find them easily with your hands but
still<00:00:45.120> adds<00:00:45.359> up<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.500> phone's<00:00:47.399> keypad

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
still adds up the other phone's keypad

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.959 
still adds up the other phone's keypad
is<00:00:47.940> still<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:49.850> as<00:00:50.850> usable<00:00:51.660> even<00:00:52.969> when

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is still pretty much as usable even when

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
is still pretty much as usable even when
you<00:00:54.059> look<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> screen<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.559> both<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.160> a
