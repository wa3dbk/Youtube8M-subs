00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.060
Hello, friends! Or as Turkish people say – merhaba!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.760
They also say iyi günler – good day - or iyi geceler – good night.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.820
These are a few words we’ve learnt so far.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.780
Actually, we’ve learnt more, but we will get to that later.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.760
So, we crossed the Dardanelles on a ferry and ended up in a famous city of Çanakkale.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.920
In 1915, during the First World War, this was a spot of a very important battle between Turkey on one side

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.360
and England and its allies, Australia and New Zealand, on the other.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.440
Many Turkish soldiers died in Çanakkale, but Turkey won.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.640
Çanakkale was a very important, strategic town.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.400
Had Turkey lost that battle, who knows what would have happened to the country

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.820
and whether we would be able to roam around freely here?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.780
We got very lucky in Çanakkale, because we managed to collect some folklore.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.580
We met…

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.580
I forgot his name, because Turkish names are quite difficult to remember.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.600
Anyway, a teacher of traditional dances. He has his own school.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.920
...Ersin, his name is Ersin!

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.840
Ersin also teaches in an ordinary school, which we ended up visiting before the so cold Art school.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.840
We met all the teachers, the principal.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.640
Everything was so official, except for us:

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.060
dressed in kind of shabby, ordinary, cycling clothes, sitting in the principal’s office.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.480
And in every office that we visited we were offered…

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.160
Tea! Of course, tea.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.500
Then Ersin gathered the children.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.580
It was like a plague. We felt like locusts surrounded us.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.780
They were spinning around us, touching us, “Photo, photo, photo”.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.080
Then we hid inside the school, at the vice principal’s office.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.260
English teacher said, “Oh my God, what’s going on? I don’t know what’s going on with them. It’s impossible to stop them”.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.200
We waited for about 40 mins; they calmed down.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.260
Then we went outside again to watch the kids perform their traditional dances that Ersin had taught them.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.440
It was quite a spectacle.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.980
These crazy, out of control kids managed to learn such a long piece and dance it impeccably.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.380
Finally, the school visit ended with a national anthem.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.820
They gathered in front of the school.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.640
The teachers and the principal were standing on top of the stairs.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.300
While the flag was being raised, everyone, 1250 pupils, were singing the anthem.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.920
As soon as it was over though, all of them, like locusts, started running again.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.860
And approached us again, “Photo, photo, photo! Selfie, selfie, selfie!”.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:45.680
