00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.720
 cantaloupe 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.720
 no longer 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.530
 the first step 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.530
 you have to wash it very well 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.900
 ah 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 then there there are certain ways of 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 do this as you are going to eat it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.079
 I'm going to add to doing a little bit of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.440
 the two 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.620
 if you are going to peel this is the way 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 correct to do 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 all out 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.170
 because we are doing here is that you 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.170
 we are removing the shell 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.360
 so when we 're going we 're going to this 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.510
 cut it towards friendship towards the middle 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 we are not transferring the possibility 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.700
 d 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.520
 of any contamination that is outside 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.020
 inwards then we are already arrives 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.230
 there 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.620
 a half 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.820
 and ready then here with a spoon or 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.240
 if you have one of these 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 you arrive 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.270
 the seeds though for some reason not 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.460
 I know what and nutrition to tempt the seeds 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.469
 of figured out but there are times I like 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.759
 leave a few to the island for 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.759
 go chewing them with 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.580
 with the fruit and I like to eat 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.150
 this way look 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.150
 this is called that we can 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.570
 this is called camps and the ingredient 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.550
 because the important thing about this is that it has 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.380
 now in time has iodine asylum so 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.340
 will transmit so it was that I found it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.740
 when they look for translations and help 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.540
 means iodine and the airline is very 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 necessary for you to create 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.040
 that is to keep the thyroid well 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.379
 to keep the thyroid well one has 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.689
 that is , consuming this is 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.689
 necessary in the diet but according to that 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:47.370
 as land and land no longer 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.370
 they are as fertile as before 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.310
 that food is no longer no longer there 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.180
 is not found in fruits in the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.690
 vegetables so much for that they say it's 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.870
 better one eats sea chard than 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.810
 because they are full of that self and that's what 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.310
 protects one the same this 2 this one knows 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.120
 more to salt for people who are 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.920
 as in transition 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920
 it is good to consume two 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.840
 and it tastes better is I hope when 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.330
 let's look 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:27.880
 a spoonful not a teaspoon 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:31.240
 has 220 of the iodine needed for the day 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.680
 while it says it has two thousand 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.350
 then two hundred and sixty percent 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.750
 this is so and has opened it look at me the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.360
 I have also opened but it is already 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.220
 it's open to be here in the low and look 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.810
 that when one is going to buy this one 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.430
 believes that until the day comes filled not 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.810
 It's half full, I do not know why 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.290
 he does then I like to get there and 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.290
 over 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.920
 inside everywhere 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.180
 and then I eat I'm going this way I 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.180
 comes to one 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.890
 and now ready another way you can 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.170
 do is dig is peeling finish 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.860
 minds what you're going to do is that you 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.860
 remove here 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.870
 the inside 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.730
 and you are cutting 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.810
 I was peeling out watering 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.520
 keep more of the possible fruit 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.400
 my cooking skills with the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.100
 knife as you can see they are not icv but 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.350
 I do the best I can if you understand me 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.750
 I'm no expert to cut the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.370
 things like more like ordinary 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.020
 in that sense but as a fruit 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.289
 important, I'm touching my food 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.900
 I transmit to you the energy the joy 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.610
 I feel for eating fruits and do not believe 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.949
 that energy that you apply to the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.919
 food you will feel your life 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.440
 Your children will feel your love for you 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.139
 husband until kissing the people who 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.139
 go to cook no she can get there 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.759
 here 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.060
 and he already has bits to eat from 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.740
 this way if you want later more 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.169
 they want more kids had already called 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.840
 least have an idea with is a talk 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.780
 he throws a little bit is above or 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.819
 more than she has afterwards an appetizer 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.550
 to fill me up, eat me out there 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.710

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.180
