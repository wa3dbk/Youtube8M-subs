actual web address there you can check
them<00:03:17.100> out<00:03:17.190> yourselves<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.680> fabric<00:03:20.069> itself<00:03:20.370> as

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
them out yourselves the fabric itself as

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.729 
them out yourselves the fabric itself as
I<00:03:20.670> said<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.630> kind<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.470> dew<00:03:23.010> point<00:03:24.739> shower

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
I said it's kind of a dew point shower

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.410 
I said it's kind of a dew point shower
proof<00:03:26.069> material<00:03:26.340> very<00:03:27.030> lightweight

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.460 

basically<00:03:31.940> one<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.120> downsides<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:34.889> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
basically one of the downsides is the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.990 
basically one of the downsides is the
when<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> undo<00:03:37.950> their<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:39.420> velcro<00:03:39.690> piece

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
when you undo their the velcro piece

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.339 
when you undo their the velcro piece
this<00:03:42.000> should<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.450> another<00:03:42.810> piece<00:03:43.049> here<00:03:43.319> I

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
this should be another piece here I

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.960 
this should be another piece here I
think<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:44.730> close<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.690> over<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.200> besides<00:03:46.590> that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
think to close it over but besides that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.539 
think to close it over but besides that
that<00:03:47.970> helps<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:49.040> zipper<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> pretty

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
that helps you do it zipper is pretty

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.240 
that helps you do it zipper is pretty
nice<00:03:51.799> easy<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.980> open<00:03:53.359> one<00:03:54.359> hand<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:56.099> this<00:03:56.190> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
nice easy to open one hand and this is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.710 
nice easy to open one hand and this is
the<00:03:56.459> inside<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:56.940> there<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.150> inside<00:03:57.419> is<00:03:57.569> not

manufacturers of this actually recommend

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.000 
manufacturers of this actually recommend
that<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.460> do<00:04:25.669> stop<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.949> do<00:04:28.729> find<00:04:29.240> a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.760 
I'll get it with my normal stuff maybe
it<00:04:41.810> helps<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.260> compress<00:04:42.740> it<00:04:42.889> down

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
it helps it compress it down

here are hiking little bit of warmth I

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.170 
here are hiking little bit of warmth I
think<00:06:16.100> as<00:06:16.280> a<00:06:16.310> survival<00:06:17.210> sleeping<00:06:18.020> bag<00:06:19.180> that's

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
think as a survival sleeping bag that's

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.090 
think as a survival sleeping bag that's
gonna<00:06:20.419> pack<00:06:20.720> down<00:06:20.960> pretty<00:06:21.260> small<00:06:21.380> cubes<00:06:21.950> about

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
gonna pack down pretty small cubes about

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.980 
gonna pack down pretty small cubes about
me<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.310> pack<00:06:23.080> it's<00:06:24.080> ideal<00:06:24.760> having<00:06:25.760> the<00:06:26.000> sheriff

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.180 
me a pack it's ideal having the sheriff
proof<00:06:27.139> material<00:06:27.260> and<00:06:27.650> the<00:06:27.710> outside<00:06:28.010> is<00:06:28.040> really

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
proof material and the outside is really

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.220 
proof material and the outside is really
nice<00:06:29.380> she's<00:06:30.380> probably<00:06:30.590> only<00:06:30.770> got<00:06:31.480> basing<00:06:32.480> and

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
nice she's probably only got basing and

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.840 
nice she's probably only got basing and
fiber<00:06:33.560> foam<00:06:33.889> inside

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
fiber foam inside

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.930 
fiber foam inside
which<00:06:36.210> helps<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.630> insulate<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.640> because<00:06:38.640> the

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
which helps you insulate it because the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.470 
which helps you insulate it because the
fabric<00:06:39.420> on<00:06:39.540> the<00:06:39.630> outside<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.260> actual<00:06:41.480> shower

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
fabric on the outside is actual shower

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.110 
fabric on the outside is actual shower
fruit<00:06:43.010> it's<00:06:44.010> not<00:06:44.250> very<00:06:44.460> breathable<00:06:44.730> which

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
fruit it's not very breathable which

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.880 
fruit it's not very breathable which
means<00:06:45.330> that<00:06:45.450> it<00:06:45.540> traps<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:45.930> heat<00:06:46.050> a<00:06:46.500> lot

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
means that it traps the heat a lot

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.090 
means that it traps the heat a lot
better<00:06:47.600> so<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:48.690> can<00:06:48.720> actually<00:06:48.930> get<00:06:49.260> some

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
better so you can actually get some

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.830 
better so you can actually get some
pretty<00:06:50.370> good<00:06:50.460> warmth<00:06:51.000> in<00:06:51.150> this<00:06:51.300> like<00:06:51.480> already

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
pretty good warmth in this like already

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840 
pretty good warmth in this like already
I<00:06:52.140> can<00:06:52.680> feel<00:06:52.860> myself<00:06:53.010> setting<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.520> heat<00:06:53.670> up

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
I can feel myself setting the heat up

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.940 
I can feel myself setting the heat up
