yeah so this is master plan one but I

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.810 
yeah so this is master plan one but I
figured<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:23.060> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.449> neat<00:00:25.430> it's<00:00:26.430> more

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
figured that this is more neat it's more

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.370 
figured that this is more neat it's more
big<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.480> nicer<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> yeah<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> say<00:00:33.540> master<00:00:34.140> plan

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
big and nicer so yeah so say master plan

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.299 
big and nicer so yeah so say master plan
Clark<00:00:34.860> International<00:00:35.010> Airport<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> then<00:00:37.800> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
Clark International Airport and then so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.080 
Clark International Airport and then so
yeah<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:41.280> phase<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
yeah so here first phase is the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.450 
yeah so here first phase is the
concourse<00:00:43.370> where<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:47.510> want<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> check-in

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
concourse where the want to check-in

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.630 
concourse where the want to check-in
immigrations<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> yeah<00:00:52.800> I've<00:00:53.250> measured

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
immigrations are so yeah I've measured

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
immigrations are so yeah I've measured
them<00:00:54.030> already<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.710> should<00:00:55.920> make

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
them already but I think I should make

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.610 
them already but I think I should make
it<00:00:56.129> smaller

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
it smaller

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
it smaller
okay<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.680> phase<00:00:59.340> two<00:00:59.699> will<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.989> Star

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
don't know if this will be tree or maybe

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.760 
don't know if this will be tree or maybe
it<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.740> just<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.190> due<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:21.230> cargo<00:02:22.230> gate<00:02:22.410> so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
it will just be due to cargo gate so

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.710 
it will just be due to cargo gate so
yeah<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:26.310> these<00:02:26.790> two<00:02:27.120> gates<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.690> be

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
yeah these these two gates can be

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.870 
yeah these these two gates can be
wide-body<00:02:28.470> gates<00:02:28.860> or<00:02:30.440> narrow<00:02:31.440> body<00:02:31.800> gates<00:02:32.190> but

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
wide-body gates or narrow body gates but

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.720 
wide-body gates or narrow body gates but
mostly<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> hope<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.350> wide-body<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.430> since

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
mostly I hope it's wide-body a since
