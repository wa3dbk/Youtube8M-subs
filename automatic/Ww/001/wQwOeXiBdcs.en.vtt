00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.660
 how about friends in children to an even more baby 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.010
 good because this is going to be a means to give you some tips for your computer 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.630
 good one is that several have asked me that if so 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.679
 Huesca by bike with the little ones followed enlarged 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.849
 or this way 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.689
 I think that she in the sinkholes and I said it but good 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.999
 maybe not those people do not call him so much the sixth expedition 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.939
 several videos and that's why they have not seen but good 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.210
 here I will put it like this in a video how to fight 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.629
 and apart I'll give you other tips massacre 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.330
 he knows if little guys do not have an essence but accounts 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 is to give you an appearance of your computer that 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.790
 percent 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.680
 and that's what we're going to do 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.900
 for the icons it is 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.410
 preferably you have to have percent 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.010
 a mouse 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.260
 do not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.710
 those that have roots in the middle 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.960
 well then what are we going to do is on the keyboard later 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.999
 control more 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.150
 art 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.440
 we are going to press the same time and correct the dspm for the opponent if the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.680
 you want bigger 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 down below which is smaller and medium 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.480
 there I am doing and it reels and it is the smallest thing that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.660
 the most prone 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.970
 for the little ones that can be efe 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.070
 So, bigger parallels 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 which also has a large part is mine 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600
 untill there 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.450
 So far from Granda Tantowi, I went around, you depend, yes. 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 what are your icons because something is already happening to us they are put 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.070
 around 1 a square when students win but 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.119
 in this case and the meat and how can you solve with that 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.620
 that squares 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.350
 percent 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.380
 the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 still this little thing works the straw I wanted recycle bin 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.930
 You can change it by doing this month 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 we will customize 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 we go where and change the color of the desktop 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.819
 and here I am afraid is that the recycling bin your folder and itaquÃ­ stand 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.459
 we trained the square for example is 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.009
 i then change and with the seminar 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.029
 i look emily with what you want to change the same with the other 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.759
 with the hem 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.909
 we skin aralar accepts the keel will have its adams 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.720
 the dressing gown the recycling bin change 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.799
 blind and with a different p 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.029
 Well, the athletic percent is for example for the selection that they see 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.909
 here you guys I'm doing this blue 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.149
 percent 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:47.009
 with the hairline is so component the PC lead shirt but I still believe 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.099
 which is black or blue reminds us 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.579
 now I change it 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.279
 what we're going to do for that spiny custom 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.290
 aa 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.619
 here in window color 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.869
 good also serves for windows vista 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:05.609
 that also trips is all these things that window like five years 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.789
 view from here you get advanced configuration if you have skin per hundred the 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.569
 I was not a batista 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.379
 then throw here 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.200
 and in these options here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.200
 where is 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.859
 selected items while if this is in half or fish the 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:24.939
 hairline 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939
 for example meringues I'm going to change it to rosita 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.439
 good to the Indian 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.879
 to accept 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.459
 And apply 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.899
 decree 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.269
 I'm going to make a zoom is with him with love seat then there they go 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.009
 operate 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.020
 then you to change the zone 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.069
 what we are going to do is 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.069
 right here where you saw 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.669
 iker link 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:01.249
 ana here in 2 100 meters the blue we will change it for example I'm going to 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.089
 put a lead 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.139
 I read and apply 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.809
 There is meat the selection before 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:13.189
 is father of the most acceptable and four blocks the history cambures us 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.090
 there will be many elections and 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.980
 good for with for example if you do not want percent and have the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.199
 selection is percent 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 with the selection of some object or something 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.749
 this is another myth for example if you want to remove what dawns and bonds 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.400
 adal 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.699
 good team I do it differently where it is clear that this panel handle 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.940
 of control to adopt windows 7 that talked cinema we're going team click 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.330
 right properties 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.330
 i in the configuration 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.289
 advanced system efe 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.119
 gillard who advanced options in the tab we are going to configuration 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.889
 i here where it says 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.889
 among the 14 finalists 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.110
 that this must still be shown 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.389
 shown the rectangle of the translucent selection we removed the popcorn 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.189
 let's see 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.960
 has explained 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.309
 and then accept 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.150
 and we accept it 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.319
 then I looked here already it took off 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.069
 I will kalakhel adapt 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.409
 that they notice that they do not kill 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.150
 blind, not because that is DNA 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.090
 to remove the afe selection to talk about it 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.900
 because the same mommies put me back the popcorn back 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.300
 to another that is also that if it has happened to me 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.440
 was that for example or when I told them that we changed that they are personalized 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.000
 with the smell of the windows flowers in advanced 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.320
 and where we put the color lilita and all that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.969
 percent elements of the scene 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.809
 it was also for for example menem here they are looking at what the color is 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.629
 lifetime 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.129
 for example also in mosul 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.559
 I think it is internet you are the moment to select comments mines direct amy 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.049
 can fit any color is any color that the judge acting 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.039
 Good today, well, that's the tips, I hope you give her her this 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:16.869
 video 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:18.809
 and well, see you in 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.520
 another video and have an excellent day falls
