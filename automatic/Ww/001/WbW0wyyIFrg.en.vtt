Gold Nugget loquat video this loquat
right<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> Big<00:01:07.080> Jim<00:01:07.790> Big<00:01:08.790> Jim<00:01:09.090> trees<00:01:09.510> are

right here is Big Jim Big Jim trees are

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
right here is Big Jim Big Jim trees are
a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:10.710> robust<00:01:11.460> growing<00:01:12.180> than

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a little bit more robust growing than

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.130 
a little bit more robust growing than
gold<00:01:13.110> nugget<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.840> tree

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
gold nugget you can see that this tree

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.399 
gold nugget you can see that this tree
has<00:01:16.170> been<00:01:16.320> kept<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.880> smaller<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.729> denser

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
has been kept a lot smaller and denser

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.190 
has been kept a lot smaller and denser
then<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:23.460> tree<00:01:23.700> over<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.110> that's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
then this tree over here and that's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
then this tree over here and that's
because<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.990> growers<00:01:27.990> come<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> they

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because the growers come in and they

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
because the growers come in and they
prune<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> wood<00:01:31.110> back<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.909> graft

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
prune the wood back here and then graft

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.410 
prune the wood back here and then graft
it<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> seedling<00:01:35.460> root<00:01:35.670> stock<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it on to the seedling root stock and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.649 
it on to the seedling root stock and
what<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> mean<00:01:37.020> by<00:01:37.079> seedling<00:01:37.740> root<00:01:37.979> stock<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
what I mean by seedling root stock is

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
what I mean by seedling root stock is
loquats<00:01:39.659> produce<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.409> immense<00:01:40.829> amount<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
loquats produce an immense amount of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
loquats produce an immense amount of
fruit<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.350> from<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> fruit<00:01:45.200> obviously<00:01:46.200> we

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
fruit and from that fruit obviously we

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
fruit and from that fruit obviously we
get<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.680> seeds<00:01:48.259> oops<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.860> much<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> seed

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
get some seeds oops so much for the seed

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.980 
get some seeds oops so much for the seed
actually<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
actually here it is

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.280 
actually here it is
there's<00:01:53.710> couple<00:01:54.280> good<00:01:54.580> seeds<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.840> look<00:01:59.049> what

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
there's couple good seeds and look what

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.040 
there's couple good seeds and look what
germinates<00:01:59.979> very<00:02:00.460> easily<00:02:00.820> if<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.780> want<00:02:01.960> to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
germinates very easily if you want to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.090 
germinates very easily if you want to
make<00:02:02.200> your<00:02:02.409> own<00:02:02.760> trees<00:02:04.440> it's<00:02:05.440> not<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.830> hard

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
make your own trees it's not that hard

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.630 
make your own trees it's not that hard
the<00:02:06.729> seeds<00:02:07.150> will<00:02:07.360> sprout<00:02:07.390> pretty<00:02:08.319> quickly<00:02:08.649> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the seeds will sprout pretty quickly and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.750 
the seeds will sprout pretty quickly and
you'll<00:02:10.270> get<00:02:10.840> fruiting<00:02:11.470> material<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you'll get fruiting material you get a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.449 
you'll get fruiting material you get a
fruit<00:02:13.120> tree<00:02:13.390> from<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.890> will<00:02:14.980> not<00:02:15.190> be

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
fruit tree from this but it will not be

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.449 
fruit tree from this but it will not be
the<00:02:15.610> same<00:02:15.880> as<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> parent<00:02:16.660> maybe<00:02:17.530> very<00:02:17.890> tasty

all<00:03:41.139> those<00:03:41.500> are<00:03:41.530> blooms<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.459> might<00:03:42.939> get<00:03:43.150> one

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
all those are blooms you might get one

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.250 
all those are blooms you might get one

three depending upon Variety police if
it<00:03:51.099> was<00:03:51.219> a<00:03:51.250> hose<00:03:51.579> over<00:03:51.609> kado<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:53.230> know<00:03:53.319> you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:53.469 
it was a hose over kado you know you

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.490 
it was a hose over kado you know you
could<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:53.950> thousand<00:03:54.669> blooms<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> branch

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
could have a thousand blooms on a branch

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.509 
could have a thousand blooms on a branch
and<00:03:56.829> maybe<00:03:57.069> get<00:03:57.549> three<00:03:57.939> avocados<00:03:59.129> by<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.159> time

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
and maybe get three avocados by a time

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.449 
and maybe get three avocados by a time
you're<00:04:01.199> all<00:04:02.199> the<00:04:02.590> way<00:04:02.739> through<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.189> process

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
you're all the way through the process

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.899 
you're all the way through the process
saying<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.480> very<00:04:04.889> low<00:04:05.889> yield<00:04:06.250> for<00:04:06.699> all<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
saying it's very low yield for all the

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.849 
saying it's very low yield for all the
blooms<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.510> they<00:04:07.629> produce<00:04:07.900> loquat

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
blooms that they produce loquat

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.970 
blooms that they produce loquat
completely<00:04:09.819> opposite<00:04:10.449> almost<00:04:11.409> all<00:04:11.709> these

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
completely opposite almost all these

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.000 
completely opposite almost all these
flowers<00:04:12.549> will<00:04:12.819> develop<00:04:13.329> into<00:04:13.599> fruit<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.829> when

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
flowers will develop into fruit and when

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.400 
flowers will develop into fruit and when
properly<00:04:15.519> watered<00:04:15.790> grow<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.419> very<00:04:16.780> tasty

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
properly watered grow to very tasty

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.470 
properly watered grow to very tasty
sizes

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.410 

so<00:04:22.020> these<00:04:22.290> again<00:04:22.740> these<00:04:23.010> are<00:04:23.340> all<00:04:23.400> big<00:04:23.820> gems

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420
