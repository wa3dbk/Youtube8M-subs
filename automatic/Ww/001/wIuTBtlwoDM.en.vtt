00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:10.850
 we are going to build 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.850
 the rhythmic audio lights 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.210
 for this we are going to use some 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.210
 materials as they are 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.400
 a proto board 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 It can be like that, boy 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.870
 three leds 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.090
 a chip 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.090
 tip 31 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.670
 with a 9 volt battery 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.960
 one that would be the power source 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 with its cable 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.620
 and a cable 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.620
 for horns 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.409
 this is our circuit already finished 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.520
 we have here already connected to the stack and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.030
 all components properly 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 soldiers 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.260
 because the battery is already behind its cable 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.900
 special already connected and soldered in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.250
 different tips of the cable from the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.630
 our current and ground wires 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.469
 the LEDs are connected in series 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469
 that is to say 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.799
 the cathode of the first reveal connected 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.960
 to the anode of the second LED and the cathode of the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.400
 second led connected to the anode of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.840
 third led 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.780
 so they would be connected in series 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.560
 the red wire or current is connected 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:59.789
 to what is the anode of the first led 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.179
 the anode that we can see here a led 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:07.380
 it also corresponds to the little leg 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.190
 long of a led 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 also called anode or current what 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.970
 it's the positive 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.190
 then as I said the cable 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.980
 red bullet not what after the cathode goes with 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.260
 the anode of the second led 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.230
 and the cathode of the second led with the anode 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 of the third led and the cathode of the third 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.069
 led is connected to the chip 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.239
 to what is the little foot of the middle the chip 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.870
 has three legs that is bc and in the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.030
 means the base 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.480
 this would be connected there to the little foot of 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.480
 in the middle 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.790
 what is it that the third leg of the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.700
 chip is connected to both the current 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.510
 of equal forgiveness to the land of our 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.240
 battery and the ground of the cables that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.610
 would be connected to the component at 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.970
 stereo 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.650
 and the red wire from the outside would go 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.700
 connected to the third leg of the chip 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 what is the time 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.640
 the circuit is already soldered 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 he appreciates the welding very well but 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.760
 I will add what is this 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.450
 the diagram so they can understand 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.450
 best 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.150
 as we can see 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.410
 the connection 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.220
 of the cables 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.370
 it would be red with red and cable 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.370
 black 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.819
 to the party 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.819
 of the entrance that is the earth 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.689
 it would be the result already 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.689
 of rhythmic audio lights
