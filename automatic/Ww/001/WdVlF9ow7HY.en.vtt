now<00:00:02.760> we're<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.210> point<00:00:03.240> where<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
now we're at the point where the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.419 
now we're at the point where the
crankshaft

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.180 

that's<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.580> variator<00:00:09.000> side<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
that's the variator side and this is the

that's the variator side and this is the
magneto<00:00:14.190> side<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.790> I'll<00:00:14.940> call<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.710 

crankshaft<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.880> held<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.420> by<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> bearing<00:00:26.720> on

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
crankshaft is held in by the bearing on

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.290 
crankshaft is held in by the bearing on
the<00:00:28.470> other<00:00:28.590> side<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> press<00:00:29.789> fit<00:00:29.820> there

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the other side which is press fit there

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.220 
the other side which is press fit there
and<00:00:31.610> also<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.000> bearing<00:00:33.360> has<00:00:33.450> press<00:00:33.780> fit<00:00:34.020> into

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and also the bearing has press fit into

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
and also the bearing has press fit into
the<00:00:34.380> case<00:00:34.590> therefore<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.850> best<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> found

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
whatever I'm hammering on I like to go

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.900 
whatever I'm hammering on I like to go
all<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> way<00:02:59.820> down<00:03:00.060> flush<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:02.400> where<00:03:02.549> see

all the way down flush to where see

that's past flush right there
flush<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.940> about<00:03:06.299> right<00:03:06.630> here

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
flush would you have about right here

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.990 
flush would you have about right here
that's<00:03:07.950> flush<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.549> go<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.120> little<00:03:09.150> bit

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
that's flush I go just a little bit

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.069 
that's flush I go just a little bit
above<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.540> where<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.989> get<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> lot<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.709> them

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
above it to where I get a lot of them

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
above it to where I get a lot of them
then<00:03:16.079> not<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:17.030> lot<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.209> meat<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:20.510> crank

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
then not a lot of the meat of the crank

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.470 
then not a lot of the meat of the crank
on<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:23.579> not<00:03:23.730> directly<00:03:24.209> hitting

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
on to this but I'm not directly hitting

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.710 
on to this but I'm not directly hitting
on<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.230> end<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.329> crank<00:03:27.329> where<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.600> going

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
on the end of the crank where I'm going

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890 
on the end of the crank where I'm going
to<00:03:27.780> deform<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.910> then<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.090> take<00:03:30.120> our<00:03:30.329> mallet

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to deform it and then we take our mallet

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.509 
to deform it and then we take our mallet
and<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.200> hit<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:31.590> here<00:03:31.620> now<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> trick<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
and we hit right here now the trick to

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.440 
and we hit right here now the trick to
this<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:34.430> not<00:03:35.430> giving<00:03:35.670> an<00:03:35.730> old<00:03:35.820> college<00:03:36.090> trick

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
this is not giving an old college trick

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.309 
this is not giving an old college trick
that<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.690> know<00:03:37.200> about<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.170> put

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
that I know about is that you can put

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.170 
that I know about is that you can put
your<00:03:40.470> will<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.890> put<00:03:41.099> your<00:03:41.129> hand<00:03:41.459> up<00:03:41.550> here<00:03:41.849> or

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
your will you put your hand up here or

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.570 
your will you put your hand up here or
down

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
down

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.190 
down
here<00:03:42.700> or<00:03:42.790> wherever<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.720> when<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.990> go<00:03:44.170> to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
here or wherever but when you go to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.880 
here or wherever but when you go to
swing<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.750> nut<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.500> don't<00:03:47.740> move

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
swing at this nut that you don't move

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.890 
swing at this nut that you don't move
your<00:03:48.070> head<00:03:48.250> up<00:03:48.720> or<00:03:49.720> down<00:03:50.320> or<00:03:50.910> sideways<00:03:51.910> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
your head up or down or sideways and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.780 
your head up or down or sideways and
you'll<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.830> tendency<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.310> do<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.460> if

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
you'll have a tendency to do that if

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.470 
you'll have a tendency to do that if
your<00:03:55.300> eyes<00:03:55.510> are<00:03:55.840> looking<00:03:55.960> directly<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:58.150> this

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
your eyes are looking directly on this

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.550 
your eyes are looking directly on this
and<00:03:58.780> not<00:03:59.140> moving<00:04:00.030> when<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.120> go<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.260> if<00:04:05.410> your

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
and not moving when you go and if your

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.050 
and not moving when you go and if your
eyes<00:04:05.680> are<00:04:05.710> not<00:04:05.950> moving<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.550> way<00:04:06.730> or<00:04:06.910> this<00:04:07.000> way

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
eyes are not moving this way or this way

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.810 
eyes are not moving this way or this way
or<00:04:07.390> up<00:04:07.600> or<00:04:07.750> down<00:04:08.250> then<00:04:09.250> you'll<00:04:09.400> get<00:04:09.580> it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
or up or down then you'll get it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.060 
or up or down then you'll get it
dead<00:04:10.030> center<00:04:10.270> every<00:04:10.600> time<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.380> few<00:04:11.830> whacks

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
dead center every time and a few whacks

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.240 
dead center every time and a few whacks
and<00:04:12.520> it'll<00:04:13.300> pop<00:04:13.480> right<00:04:13.510> out<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:14.260> can't<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.160> it

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
and it'll pop right out I can't do it

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.229 
and it'll pop right out I can't do it
with<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:16.380> camera<00:04:17.380> on<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:17.890> I'm<00:04:18.609> gonna<00:04:18.790> whack<00:04:19.030> it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
with the camera on so I'm gonna whack it

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.130 
with the camera on so I'm gonna whack it
off<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:21.120> that's<00:04:22.120> no<00:04:22.330> pun<00:04:22.570> intended

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
off and that's no pun intended

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.440 
off and that's no pun intended
and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:24.340> I'm<00:04:24.430> will<00:04:24.610> take<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> look<00:04:24.970> at<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.240> now

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.390 

I<00:04:28.450> give<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.780> few<00:04:28.960> good<00:04:29.020> hits<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:30.160> knocked

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
I give it a few good hits and it knocked

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.950 
I give it a few good hits and it knocked
the<00:04:30.580> crank<00:04:31.300> out<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.730> for<00:04:34.090> some<00:04:34.330> unknown

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
the crank out and for some unknown

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.540 
the crank out and for some unknown
reason<00:04:35.680> I've<00:04:35.860> never<00:04:36.070> seen<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.490> happen

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
reason I've never seen this happen

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.240 
reason I've never seen this happen
before<00:04:36.850> really<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.320> bearings<00:04:38.680> stayed<00:04:38.980> in

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
before really but the bearings stayed in

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.520 
before really but the bearings stayed in
the<00:04:39.370> case<00:04:40.050> here<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.520> here<00:04:43.260> normally<00:04:44.260> what

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
the case here and here normally what

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.290 
the case here and here normally what
happens<00:04:44.950> when<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.190> whenever<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:45.790> pull<00:04:46.090> them<00:04:46.240> out

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
happens when I whenever I pull them out

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.560 
happens when I whenever I pull them out
this<00:04:46.540> is<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> stroker<00:04:47.080> cranker<00:04:47.530> here<00:04:48.480> but<00:04:49.480> the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
this is a stroker cranker here but the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.930 
this is a stroker cranker here but the
bearings<00:04:49.960> always<00:04:50.310> stay<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.200> crank<00:04:53.820> as<00:04:54.820> you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
bearings always stay on the crank as you

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.070 
bearings always stay on the crank as you
can<00:04:55.090> see<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:57.120> they<00:04:58.120> come<00:04:58.330> out<00:04:58.360> away<00:04:58.840> from<00:04:58.990> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
can see and they come out away from the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.650 
can see and they come out away from the
case<00:04:59.580> what's<00:05:00.580> happened<00:05:00.940> here<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.120> he<00:05:01.390> is<00:05:01.630> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
case what's happened here is he is the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.200 
case what's happened here is he is the
exact<00:05:02.080> opposite<00:05:02.680> which<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.130> which<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> good

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
exact opposite which is which is a good

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.240 
exact opposite which is which is a good
deal<00:05:04.800> but<00:05:05.800> as<00:05:07.169> we<00:05:08.169> take<00:05:08.410> these<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:09.010> motor

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
deal but as we take these the motor

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.010 
deal but as we take these the motor
apart<00:05:09.640> with<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.419> said<00:05:10.600> we<00:05:10.720> need<00:05:10.870> to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
apart with it like I said we need to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.420 
apart with it like I said we need to
really<00:05:11.260> look<00:05:11.470> at<00:05:11.650> at<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.640> engine<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:14.310> see<00:05:15.310> if

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
really look at at the engine and see if

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.550 
really look at at the engine and see if
we<00:05:15.520> can<00:05:15.669> see<00:05:15.850> any<00:05:17.940> any<00:05:18.940> signs<00:05:19.180> of<00:05:19.330> damage<00:05:19.560> now

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
we can see any any signs of damage now

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.990 
we can see any any signs of damage now
if<00:05:20.680> you<00:05:20.770> look<00:05:20.950> at<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.130> crank<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.640> say<00:05:21.790> well

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
if you look at this crank you say well

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.200 
if you look at this crank you say well
it's<00:05:22.240> okay<00:05:22.600> it's<00:05:23.310> start<00:05:24.310> through<00:05:24.850> throw<00:05:25.150> it

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
it's okay it's start through throw it

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.240 
it's okay it's start through throw it
away<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.510> way<00:05:25.630> big<00:05:25.840> deal<00:05:26.020> well<00:05:26.979> that<00:05:27.100> may<00:05:27.190> be

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
away in a way big deal well that may be

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.640 
away in a way big deal well that may be
true<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:28.350> if<00:05:29.350> you'll<00:05:29.470> notice<00:05:29.710> on<00:05:29.979> this<00:05:30.130> side

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
true but if you'll notice on this side

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.260 
true but if you'll notice on this side
down<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:33.130> is<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.400> bearing<00:05:33.700> race<00:05:33.880> here

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
down this is the bearing race here

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.890 
down this is the bearing race here
that's<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.340> part<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.550> this<00:05:37.180> inner<00:05:37.540> race

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
that's the part that this inner race

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.670 
that's the part that this inner race
they<00:05:38.440> called<00:05:39.540> this<00:05:40.540> is<00:05:40.750> an<00:05:40.870> inner<00:05:41.080> race<00:05:41.350> and

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
they called this is an inner race and

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.180 
they called this is an inner race and
the<00:05:41.950> outside<00:05:42.400> is<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.610> outer<00:05:42.880> race<00:05:44.520> but<00:05:45.520> on

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
the outside is the outer race but on

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.020 
the outside is the outer race but on
Magneto's<00:05:48.190> side<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:49.540> metal<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:50.700> normal<00:05:51.700> no

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
Magneto's side the metal is normal no

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.700 
Magneto's side the metal is normal no
problems

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
problems

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.070 
problems
but<00:05:54.490> if<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.670> look<00:05:54.880> on<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.360> side<00:05:55.540> that<00:05:55.720> I<00:05:55.870> just

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
but if you look on the side that I just

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.680 
but if you look on the side that I just
punched<00:05:56.440> out<00:05:57.270> you'll<00:05:58.270> notice<00:05:58.740> that<00:06:00.690> right

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
punched out you'll notice that right

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.660 
punched out you'll notice that right
along<00:06:01.900> here<00:06:02.170> it's<00:06:02.350> blue<00:06:02.620> it's<00:06:03.010> blue<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.370> it's

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
along here it's blue it's blue and it's

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.520 
along here it's blue it's blue and it's
also<00:06:05.310> dark<00:06:06.310> brown<00:06:06.910> now<00:06:07.660> that's<00:06:07.870> not<00:06:08.050> rust

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
also dark brown now that's not rust

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.450 
also dark brown now that's not rust
that's<00:06:08.710> heat<00:06:10.380> so<00:06:11.380> if<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.800> heated<00:06:12.190> on<00:06:12.280> this

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
that's heat so if it's heated on this

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.620 
that's heat so if it's heated on this
side<00:06:12.670> and<00:06:13.140> it's<00:06:14.140> okay<00:06:14.560> on<00:06:14.740> this<00:06:14.890> side<00:06:15.160> right

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.020 

there<00:06:20.550> then<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.700> means<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:23.880> we<00:06:24.880> have<00:06:24.970> a

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
there then that means that we have a

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.310 
there then that means that we have a
problem<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:26.410> if<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:26.830> also<00:06:27.010> look<00:06:27.160> at<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:28.860> the

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
problem and if we also look at the the

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:41.450 
problem and if we also look at the the
con<00:06:32.320> rod<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:32.890> how<00:06:33.040> hot<00:06:33.310> it's<00:06:33.550> gotten<00:06:33.910> getting

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.010 

so<00:06:42.460> what<00:06:42.550> that<00:06:42.700> tells<00:06:42.910> me<00:06:43.030> is<00:06:43.330> that<00:06:43.390> this

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
so what that tells me is that this

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.200 
so what that tells me is that this
bearing<00:06:44.470> right<00:06:44.650> here<00:06:45.600> on<00:06:46.600> this<00:06:47.230> inner<00:06:47.470> side<00:06:48.210> is

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
bearing right here on this inner side is

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.590 
bearing right here on this inner side is
shot<00:06:52.020> somehow<00:06:53.020> this<00:06:53.290> bearing<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:54.420> has<00:06:55.420> been

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
shot somehow this bearing is has been

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.930 
shot somehow this bearing is has been
hanging<00:06:55.990> this<00:06:56.140> up<00:06:56.350> and<00:06:56.590> as<00:06:57.220> the<00:06:57.520> crank<00:06:57.820> has

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
hanging this up and as the crank has

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.140 
hanging this up and as the crank has
been<00:06:58.090> spinning<00:06:58.360> so<00:06:58.780> many<00:06:59.580> hundreds<00:07:00.580> of<00:07:00.760> how

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
been spinning so many hundreds of how

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.750 
been spinning so many hundreds of how
many<00:07:01.360> revolutions<00:07:01.800> that<00:07:02.800> this<00:07:03.070> is<00:07:03.220> hanging<00:07:03.610> up

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
many revolutions that this is hanging up

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.020 
many revolutions that this is hanging up
and<00:07:04.380> causing<00:07:05.380> friction<00:07:06.190> for<00:07:06.820> the<00:07:07.440> crank

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
and causing friction for the crank

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.840 
and causing friction for the crank
another<00:07:10.030> good<00:07:10.210> thing<00:07:10.240> to<00:07:10.480> look<00:07:10.600> for<00:07:11.010> is<00:07:12.010> right

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
another good thing to look for is right

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.760 
another good thing to look for is right
down<00:07:13.030> in<00:07:13.180> here<00:07:13.210> how<00:07:13.510> much<00:07:13.690> dirt<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:14.290> crap<00:07:14.560> is

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
down in here how much dirt and crap is

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.890 
down in here how much dirt and crap is
in<00:07:14.890> there<00:07:15.040> because<00:07:15.160> a<00:07:15.310> lot<00:07:15.520> of<00:07:15.640> guys<00:07:15.760> will<00:07:16.690> run

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
in there because a lot of guys will run

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.830 
in there because a lot of guys will run
they're<00:07:17.170> on<00:07:17.380> the<00:07:18.280> bike<00:07:18.520> the<00:07:19.270> little<00:07:19.480> motors

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
they're on the bike the little motors

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.090 
they're on the bike the little motors
their<00:07:20.080> whole<00:07:20.230> careers<00:07:20.620> and<00:07:20.860> they<00:07:20.920> won't

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
their whole careers and they won't

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.860 
their whole careers and they won't
change<00:07:21.310> the<00:07:21.520> filters<00:07:21.880> I'll<00:07:22.390> just<00:07:22.600> take<00:07:22.780> the

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
change the filters I'll just take the

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.790 
change the filters I'll just take the
filter<00:07:23.140> off<00:07:23.170> hell<00:07:23.500> with<00:07:23.650> it

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
filter off hell with it

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.890 
filter off hell with it
who<00:07:24.490> needs<00:07:24.700> filters<00:07:25.060> you<00:07:25.180> know<00:07:25.300> you<00:07:25.750> need

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
who needs filters you know you need

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.920 
who needs filters you know you need
filters<00:07:27.840> so<00:07:28.840> now<00:07:28.990> we've<00:07:29.170> got<00:07:29.320> the<00:07:29.470> crank<00:07:29.710> off
