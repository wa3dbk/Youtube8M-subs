review<00:00:13.380> today<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> didn't<00:00:14.460> actually<00:00:14.670> post<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
review today I didn't actually post a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.660 
review today I didn't actually post a
video<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.809> deleted<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.800> video<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.430> actually

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
video I deleted a video that I actually

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.150 
video I deleted a video that I actually
had<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.570> felt<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.410> didn't<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.920> as

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
had up I felt like it didn't have as

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
had up I felt like it didn't have as
much<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:20.609> quality<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> wanted<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
much as quality that I wanted it to so

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.640 
much as quality that I wanted it to so
this<00:00:23.220> video<00:00:23.550> might<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.180> late<00:00:24.510> upload<00:00:24.720> but

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
this video might be a late upload but

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
this video might be a late upload but
anyways<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.310> homework<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.330> who

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
anyways I have homework to do but who

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
anyways I have homework to do but who
actually<00:00:28.230> wants<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:28.980> homework<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.550> on

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
actually wants to do homework come on

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.420 
actually wants to do homework come on
but<00:00:30.420> anyways<00:00:30.750> let's<00:00:30.960> go<00:00:31.080> ahead<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:32.250> into

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
but anyways let's go ahead and go into

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.170 
but anyways let's go ahead and go into
the<00:00:32.669> tool<00:00:32.910> section<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.880> crafting<00:00:35.880> table

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the tool section of the crafting table

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
the tool section of the crafting table
and<00:00:36.300> these<00:00:37.110> things<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.620> available<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and these things are available for you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
and these things are available for you
to<00:00:38.579> use<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.690> cool<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.260> my

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to use which is really cool in my

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.880 
to use which is really cool in my
opinion

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
opinion

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.150 
opinion
um<00:00:41.719> they<00:00:42.719> have<00:00:42.899> custom<00:00:43.350> recipes<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
um they have custom recipes which is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
um they have custom recipes which is
really<00:00:44.399> cool<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.730> opinion<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.020> don't

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
really cool in my opinion so I I don't

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.900 
really cool in my opinion so I I don't
really<00:00:46.590> want<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> list<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> guys

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
really want to list it out so you guys

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
really want to list it out so you guys
can<00:00:48.149> check<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.469> links<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:49.920> below

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
can check it out in the links down below

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.720 
can check it out in the links down below
and<00:00:51.170> as<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.100> five

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and as you can see there are five

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
and as you can see there are five
different<00:00:54.030> types<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.539> things<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
different types of things that you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.119 
different types of things that you can
craft<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> basically<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.890> craft<00:00:58.890> all

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
craft so basically I'm gonna craft all

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.240 
craft so basically I'm gonna craft all
of<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.899> me<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> free<00:01:01.800> crafting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of them and me with the free crafting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
of them and me with the free crafting
mod<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.760> craft<00:01:03.059> everything<00:01:03.420> without

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
mod I can craft everything without

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.370 
mod I can craft everything without
actually<00:01:04.860> having<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.430> recipes<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.689> let's<00:01:07.200> go

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
actually having the recipes so let's go

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
actually having the recipes so let's go
ahead<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> try<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
ahead and try it out so this is the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.700 
ahead and try it out so this is the
anchor<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.890> pulls<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> use

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
anchor that pulls me down so when I use

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.140 
anchor that pulls me down so when I use
the<00:01:13.950> gravity<00:01:16.280> controllers<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.060> won't

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
the gravity controllers it it won't

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.570 
the gravity controllers it it won't
cause<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> float<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> ahead<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> try

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cause me to float let's go ahead and try

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.140 
cause me to float let's go ahead and try
it<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.020> gravity<00:01:25.470> controller<00:01:26.150> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it out this is the gravity controller so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.950 
it out this is the gravity controller so
boom<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.920> pretty<00:01:29.610> nice<00:01:29.960> alright

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
boom so you can see pretty nice alright

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.850 
boom so you can see pretty nice alright
so<00:01:31.320> let's<00:01:31.590> try<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.930> gravity<00:01:33.930> pod<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so let's try the gravity pod so you can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
so let's try the gravity pod so you can
make<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.030> chamber<00:01:37.549> under<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.960> believe<00:01:39.960> that's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
make a chamber under it I believe that's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.140 
make a chamber under it I believe that's
how<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.560> works

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
how it works

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.520 
how it works
oh<00:01:42.320> shoot<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.770> making<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> animals<00:01:44.850> die

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
oh shoot I'm making all the animals die

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
oh shoot I'm making all the animals die
alright<00:01:46.530> let's<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.280> ahead<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.939> experiment

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
alright let's go ahead and experiment

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.310 
alright let's go ahead and experiment
with<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> sheep<00:01:49.380> right<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.420> huh<00:01:51.420> even<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
with the sheep right there huh even the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.630 
with the sheep right there huh even the
meat<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.479> floating<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.350> cool<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
meat is floating which is cool which is

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.709 
meat is floating which is cool which is
beast<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.020> let's<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.320> ahead<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.680> try<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
beast but let's go ahead and try the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
beast but let's go ahead and try the
high<00:02:00.719> gravity<00:02:01.049> mod<00:02:01.469> I'll<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.520> them

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
high gravity mod I'll just make them

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.080 
high gravity mod I'll just make them
sink<00:02:03.060> watch<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.259> animals<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.770> die<00:02:05.130> no

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
sink watch the animals gonna die no

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.399 
sink watch the animals gonna die no
actually<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> don't<00:02:06.600> want<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> tie<00:02:07.229> right

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
actually I don't want it to tie right

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
actually I don't want it to tie right
now<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.550> ahead<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> try<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> low

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
now so let's go ahead and try the low

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.800 
now so let's go ahead and try the low
gravity<00:02:10.080> mod<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
gravity mod so

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.960 
gravity mod so
they<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.739> pretty<00:02:13.160> much<00:02:13.220> go<00:02:13.489> as<00:02:13.640> higher

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
they can like pretty much go as higher

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.410 
they can like pretty much go as higher
than<00:02:14.270> one<00:02:14.420> I'm<00:02:14.989> sorry<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:17.030> mod<00:02:17.270> is

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420

this<00:02:29.510> mod<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:30.170> came<00:02:30.349> out<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.069> wanted

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
this mod just came out so I just wanted

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.050 
this mod just came out so I just wanted
to<00:02:31.519> review<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.290> there's<00:02:33.290> also<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:34.340> gravity

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
to review it there's also the gravity

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.270 
to review it there's also the gravity
pods<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.810> make<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> gravity<00:02:37.010> chamber

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
pods that you can make a gravity chamber

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.120 
pods that you can make a gravity chamber
with<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:38.840> let's<00:02:39.170> try<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.620> without

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
with and now let's try it out without

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.729 
with and now let's try it out without
the<00:02:40.340> gravity<00:02:40.760> anchor<00:02:41.120> let's<00:02:41.930> make<00:02:42.560> ourselves

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
the gravity anchor let's make ourselves

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.850 
the gravity anchor let's make ourselves
float<00:02:43.489> let's<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.510> ahead<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.930> try<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.380> gravity

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
float let's go ahead and try the gravity

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.699 
float let's go ahead and try the gravity
controller<00:02:47.049> oh<00:02:48.049> we're<00:02:48.739> gonna<00:02:48.860> die<00:02:49.130> guys<00:02:49.430> Wow

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
controller oh we're gonna die guys Wow

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.140 
controller oh we're gonna die guys Wow
alright<00:02:51.709> let's<00:02:51.950> turn<00:02:52.190> off<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.340> difficulty

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
alright let's turn off the difficulty

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.289 
alright let's turn off the difficulty
all<00:02:53.780> right<00:02:53.930> it's<00:02:54.049> already<00:02:54.230> off<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.400> let's<00:02:56.180> go

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
all right it's already off and let's go

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.320 
all right it's already off and let's go
ahead<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.599> uh<00:02:56.690> try<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.410> gravity<00:02:58.010> pod<00:02:58.250> oops

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
ahead and uh try the gravity pod oops

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.970 
ahead and uh try the gravity pod oops
he's<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> long<00:03:00.290> ting<00:03:01.000> gravity<00:03:02.000> pod<00:03:02.709> place<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.890> on

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
he's a long ting gravity pod place it on

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.680 
he's a long ting gravity pod place it on
the<00:03:04.160> ground<00:03:05.019> boom<00:03:06.019> ahh<00:03:07.900> oh<00:03:09.190> gosh<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:11.209> was<00:03:11.450> bad

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
the ground boom ahh oh gosh that was bad

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.870 
the ground boom ahh oh gosh that was bad
guys<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.380> was<00:03:12.530> bad<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.040> don't<00:03:13.130> know<00:03:13.459> which<00:03:13.700> way

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
guys that was bad I don't know which way

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.199 
guys that was bad I don't know which way
to<00:03:13.910> go<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:14.450> oh<00:03:14.769> shoot<00:03:15.769> this<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.160> bad<00:03:16.400> news<00:03:16.640> or

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
to go now oh shoot this is bad news or

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
to go now oh shoot this is bad news or
we<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:17.900> craft<00:03:18.200> ourselves<00:03:18.970> more<00:03:20.049> but

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
we can just craft ourselves more but

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220 
we can just craft ourselves more but
let's<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.370> walk<00:03:22.609> our<00:03:22.820> waste<00:03:23.060> ourselves<00:03:24.019> way

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
let's just walk our waste ourselves way

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.059 
let's just walk our waste ourselves way
back<00:03:24.500> as<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:26.180> see<00:03:26.359> it's<00:03:26.510> right<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:27.069> so

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
back as you can see it's right there so

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.099 
back as you can see it's right there so
basically<00:03:28.430> I'm<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:28.910> teaching<00:03:29.420> guys<00:03:29.840> the

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
basically I'm just teaching guys the

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.610 
basically I'm just teaching guys the
fundamentals<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.430> mod<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.200> first<00:03:33.440> time

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
fundamentals of this mod the first time

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.199 
fundamentals of this mod the first time
I<00:03:33.650> actually<00:03:33.829> tried<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.280> use<00:03:34.549> this<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:35.120> was

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I actually tried to use this it was

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.509 
I actually tried to use this it was
really<00:03:35.510> confusing<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:37.160> wanted<00:03:37.400> to

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
really confusing so I just wanted to

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.059 
really confusing so I just wanted to
show<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.880> guys<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.120> little<00:03:38.420> bit<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.930> let's<00:03:39.859> try

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
show you guys a little bit and let's try

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.580 
show you guys a little bit and let's try
out<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.459> low<00:03:40.670> gravity<00:03:40.940> mod<00:03:41.329> this<00:03:42.200> one<00:03:42.410> I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
out the low gravity mod this one I

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.370 
out the low gravity mod this one I
believe<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.220> latest<00:03:44.209> which<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.109> hate

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
believe it's the latest which I hate

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.740 
believe it's the latest which I hate
because<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.400> would<00:03:46.579> be<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:47.209> cool<00:03:47.480> mod

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
because this would be a really cool mod

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.990 
because this would be a really cool mod
because<00:03:48.019> when<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.769> jump<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.190> jump<00:03:49.549> really

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
because when you jump you jump really

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.990 
because when you jump you jump really
high<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.709> let's<00:03:51.889> go<00:03:52.040> ahead<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.430> turn<00:03:52.790> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
high so let's go ahead and I turn that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.250 
high so let's go ahead and I turn that
off<00:03:53.239> just<00:03:53.950> because<00:03:54.950> it's<00:03:55.730> making<00:03:56.150> me<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.660> but

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
off just because it's making me like but

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.319 
off just because it's making me like but
if<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.500> guys<00:03:57.650> haven't<00:03:57.950> seen<00:03:58.370> already<00:03:58.579> there's

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
if you guys haven't seen already there's

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.770 
if you guys haven't seen already there's
actually<00:03:59.720> an<00:03:59.810> enabling<00:04:00.769> button<00:04:01.100> on<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.780> right

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
actually an enabling button on the right

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.580 
actually an enabling button on the right
hand<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:04.340> bottom<00:04:04.790> right<00:04:05.030> hand<00:04:05.209> corner<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
hand the bottom right hand corner the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.729 
hand the bottom right hand corner the
green<00:04:06.889> targeting<00:04:07.700> button<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.590> see

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
green targeting button as you can see

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.979 
green targeting button as you can see
let's<00:04:10.250> try<00:04:10.430> out<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.700> high<00:04:10.880> gravity<00:04:11.150> mod<00:04:11.510> which

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
let's try out the high gravity mod which

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.640 
let's try out the high gravity mod which
causes<00:04:12.440> me<00:04:12.620> not<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.220> jump<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.780> like<00:04:15.049> pulls<00:04:15.380> me

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
causes me not to jump it like pulls me

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.770 
causes me not to jump it like pulls me
down<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.590> can't<00:04:19.039> really<00:04:19.160> get<00:04:19.489> up<00:04:19.669> which<00:04:20.630> just

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
down so I can't really get up which just

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.659 
down so I can't really get up which just
kind<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:21.080> sucks<00:04:21.380> well<00:04:22.039> let's<00:04:22.190> go<00:04:22.310> back<00:04:22.490> to

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
kind of sucks well let's go back to

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.570 
kind of sucks well let's go back to
normal<00:04:23.090> mode<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.620> yeah<00:04:24.620> guys<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.099> hope<00:04:25.310> you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
normal mode and yeah guys I hope you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.999 
normal mode and yeah guys I hope you
has<00:04:25.669> know<00:04:25.849> how<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.060> use<00:04:26.330> his<00:04:26.509> mod<00:04:26.750> by<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.770> if

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
has know how to use his mod by now so if
