00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is most people are hitting it fat or

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
is most people are hitting it fat or
thin<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.509> reason<00:01:37.140> why<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.650> their

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thin the reason why is because their

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
thin the reason why is because their
swing<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.820> too<00:01:38.850> flat<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.400> then<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.640> go

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
swing is too flat and then when they go

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
swing is too flat and then when they go
ahead<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> swing<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.049> either<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
ahead and swing it it's either that and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
ahead and swing it it's either that and
then<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.729> afraid<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:45.840> do

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
then they're afraid of that so they do

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.310 
then they're afraid of that so they do
