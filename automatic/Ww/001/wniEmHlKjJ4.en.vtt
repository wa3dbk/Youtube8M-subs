running because he's got separate

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.100 
running because he's got separate
sprites<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:48.600> he's<00:00:48.719> running<00:00:48.870> because

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
sprites for when he's running because

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.209 
sprites for when he's running because
this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> game<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> i<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> while<00:00:50.430> back

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
this is a game that i did a while back

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.500 
this is a game that i did a while back
i've<00:00:53.219> only<00:00:53.309> done<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.760> he's<00:00:53.850> facing<00:00:54.090> left

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
i've only done it when he's facing left

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
i've only done it when he's facing left
of<00:00:54.629> facing<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.149> see

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of facing right so but as you can see

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.720 
of facing right so but as you can see
it's<00:00:57.539> working<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:58.500> good<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> bullets

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it's working really good do the bullets

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's working really good do the bullets
are<00:00:59.850> random<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.980> three<00:01:02.640> different

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
are random so they go on three different

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
are random so they go on three different
directions<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.710> randomly

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
directions but it's like randomly

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.690 
directions but it's like randomly
selected<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> spray<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
selected so you get like that spray that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.170 
selected so you get like that spray that
machine<00:01:09.510> guns<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.930> normally<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.180> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
machine guns would normally get and so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.570 
machine guns would normally get and so
i'm<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> show<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.689> guys<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it might look a lot but it's basically

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.070 
it might look a lot but it's basically
copying<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> pasting<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.790> when<00:01:18.420> she<00:01:18.570> gets<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

stopped<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> add<00:01:55.890> an<00:01:56.009> arrow<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.700> then

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
stopped then you add an arrow and then

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.990 
stopped then you add an arrow and then
if<00:01:58.570> shake<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.409> equal<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.920> two<00:02:00.130> make<00:02:00.640> sure<00:02:00.820> you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
if shake is equal to two make sure you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
if shake is equal to two make sure you
create<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.570> shake<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.979> create<00:02:03.280> part<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.360> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
create a shake in the create part of the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.600 
create a shake in the create part of the
character<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:07.420> shake<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.899> equal<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.349> two<00:02:08.610> then

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
character if shake is equal to two then

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.850 
character if shake is equal to two then
you<00:02:09.849> create<00:02:10.000> another<00:02:10.239> arrow<00:02:10.560> create<00:02:11.560> moving

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
you create another arrow create moving

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.309 
you create another arrow create moving
instance<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.310> bullet<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.660> case<00:02:13.900> I've<00:02:14.140> done

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
instance a bullet in this case I've done

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.710 
instance a bullet in this case I've done
it<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.010> bullet<00:02:15.790> starts<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.390> line

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it so that the bullet starts in line

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.100 
it so that the bullet starts in line
with<00:02:16.989> whether<00:02:17.290> gun<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> depending<00:02:19.510> on<00:02:19.510> what

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
with whether gun is so depending on what

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
with whether gun is so depending on what
your<00:02:20.260> characters<00:02:20.680> spray<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.010> looks<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.430> this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
your characters spray it looks like this

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.550 
your characters spray it looks like this
will<00:02:22.269> vary<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:23.080> that's<00:02:23.349> where<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
will vary because that's where the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.990 
will vary because that's where the
bullet<00:02:23.890> will<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.310> want<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> bullet<00:02:24.940> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
bullet will what you want the bullet to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.910 
bullet will what you want the bullet to
start<00:02:25.269> from<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.349> looks<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.800> coming

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
start from so it looks like it's coming

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380 
start from so it looks like it's coming
out<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.190> gun<00:02:27.489> because<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.970> sort<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.180> comes

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
out of gun because it sort of comes

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.820 
out of gun because it sort of comes
looks<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:28.989> coming<00:02:29.140> out<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.410> his<00:02:29.590> like

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
looks like it's coming out of his like

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.190 
looks like it's coming out of his like
stomach<00:02:30.519> instead<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.970> his<00:02:31.090> gun<00:02:31.330> when<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.080> I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
stomach instead of his gun when if I

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.839 
stomach instead of his gun when if I
didn't<00:02:32.470> add<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.650> minus<00:02:33.190> eight<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.640> way

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
didn't add the minus eight to the way

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.550 
didn't add the minus eight to the way
but<00:02:33.910> you'd<00:02:34.239> have<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.420> worry<00:02:34.630> about<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:35.080> you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
but you'd have to worry about that you

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.180 
but you'd have to worry about that you
can<00:02:35.709> customize<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.489> with<00:02:36.640> your<00:02:36.940> own<00:02:37.000> sprite

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
can customize it with your own sprite

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.809 
can customize it with your own sprite
direction<00:02:39.209> 183<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.049> for<00:02:41.290> us<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:42.069> slightly

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
direction 183 this is for us a slightly

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.270 
direction 183 this is for us a slightly
upward<00:02:44.069> bullet<00:02:45.069> not<00:02:45.370> completely<00:02:46.080> horizontal

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
upward bullet not completely horizontal

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.509 
upward bullet not completely horizontal
speed<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.430> 12<00:02:48.670> relative<00:02:49.209> okay<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.709> with

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
speed of 12 relative okay now with with

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.960 
speed of 12 relative okay now with with
one<00:02:51.849> out<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.750> chance<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.500> performing<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.610> next

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
one out to chance of performing the next

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.039 
one out to chance of performing the next
set<00:02:55.720> variable<00:02:56.230> shake<00:02:56.470> 21<00:02:56.890> ok<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:58.420> then<00:02:58.480> else

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
set variable shake 21 ok and then else

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.170 
set variable shake 21 ok and then else
and<00:02:59.530> then<00:02:59.650> set<00:02:59.860> variable<00:03:00.340> shake<00:03:00.549> 20<00:03:00.910> because

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
and then set variable shake 20 because

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.229 
and then set variable shake 20 because
this<00:03:01.299> is<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.780> shake<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.290> equal<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.680> two<00:03:02.890> ok<00:03:03.700> then

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
this is if shake is equal to two ok then

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.640 
this is if shake is equal to two ok then
you<00:03:04.299> close<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.600> off<00:03:04.780> with<00:03:04.989> an<00:03:05.109> arrow<00:03:05.319> and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you close that off with an arrow and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.400 
you close that off with an arrow and
basically<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.609> entire<00:03:07.000> area<00:03:07.239> here<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.200> just

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
basically this entire area here you just

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.349 
basically this entire area here you just
copy<00:03:08.620> twice<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.459> two<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.940> where

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
copy twice so you have two of it where

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.120 
copy twice so you have two of it where
you<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.569> first<00:03:10.840> shape<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:11.410> shake<00:03:11.709> equals

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you do it first shape if shake equals

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.000 
you do it first shape if shake equals
one<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.880> if<00:03:13.030> shake<00:03:13.239> is<00:03:13.420> equal<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.930> 0<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.260> make

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
one and if shake is equal to 0 and make

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.910 
one and if shake is equal to 0 and make
sure<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.459> um<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.630> other<00:03:16.870> two<00:03:17.079> variables<00:03:17.650> are

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
sure that um the other two variables are

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.610 
sure that um the other two variables are
not<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.970> same<00:03:19.180> as<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.900> shake<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.319> equal

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
not the same as like if shake is equal

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.650 
not the same as like if shake is equal
to<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.760> shake<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.150> equal<00:03:22.389> to<00:03:22.480> one

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
to you so the shake is equal to one

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.270 
to you so the shake is equal to one
there's<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.500> challenge<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.920> couldn't<00:03:24.220> change

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
there's a challenge that couldn't change

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.670 
there's a challenge that couldn't change
to<00:03:24.850> shake<00:03:25.150> equal<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.660> two<00:03:25.840> or<00:03:26.019> shake<00:03:26.319> equal<00:03:26.590> to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
to shake equal to two or shake equal to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.710 
to shake equal to two or shake equal to
zero<00:03:26.950> which<00:03:27.579> shake<00:03:27.819> is<00:03:27.940> equal<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.299> zero<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
zero which shake is equal to zero to the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.509 
zero which shake is equal to zero to the
charging<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.829> keep<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.280> that

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
charging so you can keep like that

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.460 
charging so you can keep like that
constant<00:03:31.000> randomness<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.840> with<00:03:32.049> where<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
constant randomness of with where the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.050 
constant randomness of with where the
bullets<00:03:32.769> are<00:03:32.829> going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.069> spray<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:33.970> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
bullets are going to spray so when you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.819 
bullets are going to spray so when you
shoot<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.389> they<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:34.989> randomly<00:03:35.410> sprays

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
shoot it they like randomly sprays

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.559 
shoot it they like randomly sprays
bullets<00:03:36.040> um<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.940> three<00:03:37.239> different<00:03:37.389> directions

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
bullets um in three different directions

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.449 
bullets um in three different directions
and<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.139> creates<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.590> realistic

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
and it creates that realistic

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.090 
and it creates that realistic
machine-gun<00:03:40.239> effect<00:03:40.799> basically<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.859> same

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
machine-gun effect basically the same

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.370 
machine-gun effect basically the same
thing<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.519> shake<00:03:42.819> equals<00:03:43.239> one<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.630> when

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
thing but for shake equals one and when

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.160 
thing but for shake equals one and when
he's<00:03:44.530> facing<00:03:44.769> left<00:03:45.720> you're<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> make<00:03:46.989> it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
he's facing left you're going to make it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.800 
he's facing left you're going to make it
so<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.380> direction<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.190> 177<00:03:48.880> ok<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.510> that's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so the direction is 177 ok so that's

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.590 
so the direction is 177 ok so that's
slightly<00:03:50.139> lower<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.549> it's<00:03:52.060> not<00:03:52.239> completely

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
slightly lower so it's not completely

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.520 
slightly lower so it's not completely
horizontal<00:03:53.170> as<00:03:53.650> as<00:03:54.040> with<00:03:54.609> this<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.180> some

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
horizontal as as with this this some

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.050 
horizontal as as with this this some
command<00:03:56.530> either<00:03:56.829> but<00:03:57.190> this<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.459> completely

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
command either but this is completely

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.870 
command either but this is completely
horizontal<00:03:58.450> one<00:03:58.840> 180<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.980> basically<00:04:00.670> what

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
horizontal one 180 and basically what

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.330 
horizontal one 180 and basically what
you're<00:04:01.000> doing<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.920> doing<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.040> exact<00:04:03.310> same

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
you're doing is doing the exact same

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.610 
you're doing is doing the exact same
thing<00:04:03.819> for<00:04:04.030> character<00:04:04.420> stop<00:04:04.810> right<00:04:05.109> which<00:04:05.440> is

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
thing for character stop right which is

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.409 
thing for character stop right which is
when<00:04:05.769> he's<00:04:05.889> facing<00:04:06.130> right<00:04:06.489> except<00:04:07.329> the

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
when he's facing right except the

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.100 
when he's facing right except the
direction<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:08.169> changes<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.709> nut

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
direction just changes the nut

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.570 
direction just changes the nut
that's<00:04:09.350> all<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.560> have<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.740> do<00:04:09.890> so<00:04:10.490> it's

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
that's all you have to do so it's

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.010 
that's all you have to do so it's
basically<00:04:10.760> once<00:04:11.240> you<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.510> one<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.750> just

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
basically once you get one you just

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.780 
basically once you get one you just
change<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.680> couple<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:13.100> commands<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.670> that's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
change a couple of commands and that's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.880 
change a couple of commands and that's
it<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.540> basically<00:04:14.870> copying<00:04:15.290> pasting<00:04:15.560> the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
it but you basically copying pasting the

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.490 
it but you basically copying pasting the
most<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.310> time<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.299> forth<00:04:17.720> for<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.200> right

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
most of the time so forth for the right

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.520 
most of the time so forth for the right
direction<00:04:19.450> 357<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> slightly<00:04:21.170> higher

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
direction 357 for a slightly higher

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.090 
direction 357 for a slightly higher
bullet<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:23.380> direction<00:04:24.380> three<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.070> a

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
bullet and direction three for a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.390 
bullet and direction three for a
slightly<00:04:25.340> lower<00:04:25.610> bullet<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.780> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
slightly lower bullet and the and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.520 
slightly lower bullet and the and
direction<00:04:28.420> zero<00:04:29.420> for<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.840> bullet<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.290> goes

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
direction zero for a bullet that goes

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.170 
direction zero for a bullet that goes
completely<00:04:30.910> perfectly<00:04:31.910> straight

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
completely perfectly straight

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.410 
completely perfectly straight
horizontally<00:04:33.110> across<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.500> screen<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:35.210> as<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
horizontally across the screen so as I

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.030 
horizontally across the screen so as I
show<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.720> before<00:04:36.040> where<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.220> have<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
show you before where you have the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.320 
show you before where you have the
spraying<00:04:40.040> see<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.520> random<00:04:40.880> spray<00:04:41.150> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
spraying see the random spray the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.960 
spraying see the random spray the
bullets<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.620> guys<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.980> see<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.280> well<00:04:43.640> jump

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
bullets if you guys can see it well jump

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.240 
bullets if you guys can see it well jump
up<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.240> dis<00:04:44.390> Lynch<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.810> show<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.410> guys<00:04:45.470> you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
up the dis Lynch and show you guys you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.740 
up the dis Lynch and show you guys you
can<00:04:46.370> see<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.669> see<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.000> random<00:04:47.450> distribution

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
can see the see the random distribution

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.600 
can see the see the random distribution
of<00:04:48.169> bullets<00:04:48.440> because<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.010> random<00:04:49.280> effect

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
of bullets because of the random effect

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.460 
of bullets because of the random effect
so<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:50.120> gives<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.510> machine<00:04:50.960> gun<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.380> a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
so it gives you that machine gun in a

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.110 
so it gives you that machine gun in a
type<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.770> effect<00:04:52.220> where<00:04:52.340> it's<00:04:52.700> really

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
type of effect where it's really

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.820 
type of effect where it's really
inaccurate<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:56.230> machine<00:04:57.230> guns<00:04:57.410> basically

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
inaccurate so machine guns basically

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.640 
inaccurate so machine guns basically
just<00:04:57.980> sprained<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:59.050> that's<00:05:00.050> that's<00:05:00.350> what<00:05:00.560> it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
just sprained and that's that's what it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.170 
just sprained and that's that's what it
basically<00:05:00.770> looks<00:05:01.250> like<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:01.730> I'm<00:05:01.820> not<00:05:01.910> sure

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
basically looks like so I'm not sure

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.210 
basically looks like so I'm not sure
this<00:05:02.480> is<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.560> what<00:05:03.710> he<00:05:03.800> wants<00:05:04.040> but<00:05:04.160> I
