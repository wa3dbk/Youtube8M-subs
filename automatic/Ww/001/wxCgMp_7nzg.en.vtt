00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.800 

you<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:17.359> it's<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.570> little

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you can see that it's really a little

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.650 
you can see that it's really a little
but<00:00:19.800> um<00:00:21.410> what<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.710> did<00:00:22.949> wrong<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.670> think<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.359> when

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
but um what I did wrong I think was when

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.700 
but um what I did wrong I think was when
I<00:00:25.760> went<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.180> didn't<00:00:27.599> eat<00:00:27.840> anything<00:00:28.199> basically

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I went I didn't eat anything basically

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.450 
I went I didn't eat anything basically
and<00:00:29.369> then<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> done<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:34.710> didn't

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and then I got it done and I didn't

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
and then I got it done and I didn't
drink<00:00:35.579> anything<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.270> i<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.540> i<00:00:36.840> was<00:00:36.989> kind<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290

dehydrated<00:00:37.920> too<00:00:38.540> yeah<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:41.180> when<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> went

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
dehydrated too yeah and then when I went
