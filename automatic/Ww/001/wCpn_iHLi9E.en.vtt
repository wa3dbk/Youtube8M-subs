is<00:02:02.600> there<00:02:02.749> anything<00:02:02.929> else<00:02:03.170> we<00:02:03.259> like<00:02:03.439> about<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
is there anything else we like about the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.169 
is there anything else we like about the
surface<00:02:03.889> it<00:02:04.249> got<00:02:04.369> more<00:02:04.520> than<00:02:04.579> 10<00:02:04.850> hours<00:02:04.880> of

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
surface it got more than 10 hours of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.199 
surface it got more than 10 hours of
battery<00:02:05.299> life<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.530> that's<00:02:06.709> quite<00:02:07.069> good<00:02:07.459> not<00:02:08.060> as

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
battery life so that's quite good not as

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.880 
battery life so that's quite good not as
long<00:02:08.539> as<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> iPad<00:02:09.290> but<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:09.650> still<00:02:09.830> a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
long as the iPad but it's still a

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.160 
long as the iPad but it's still a
respectable<00:02:10.310> amount<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:11.030> battery<00:02:11.270> life<00:02:11.390> all

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
respectable amount of battery life all

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.059 
respectable amount of battery life all
in<00:02:12.470> all<00:02:12.620> would<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.130> say<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
in all would you say that this

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.130 
in all would you say that this
surface<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.609> possible<00:02:15.329> contender<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.109> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
surface is a possible contender to the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860 
surface is a possible contender to the
ipad<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:16.920> galaxy<00:02:17.310> tab<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.879> think<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.569> isn't

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
ipad and the galaxy tab I think it isn't

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.089 
ipad and the galaxy tab I think it isn't
because<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.379> Microsoft's<00:02:20.010> operating

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
because it's Microsoft's operating

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.550 
because it's Microsoft's operating
system<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.269> probably<00:02:21.599> be<00:02:21.959> able<00:02:22.139> to<00:02:22.260> sync

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
system and you probably be able to sync

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.709 
system and you probably be able to sync
across<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.920> variety<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.639> devices<00:02:23.939> I<00:02:24.329> think<00:02:24.569> it's

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
across a variety of devices I think it's

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.319 
across a variety of devices I think it's
right<00:02:25.469> up<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.799> great<00:02:26.609> thank<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:26.939> so<00:02:26.999> much
