00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the it has the full game all the same

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
the it has the full game all the same
content<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> everything<00:00:55.049> and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.530> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
content and everything and it's just on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.859 
content and everything and it's just on
a<00:00:55.739> handheld<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:56.580> except<00:00:57.299> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.540> multiplayer

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
a handheld so except for the multiplayer

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.450 
a handheld so except for the multiplayer
I<00:00:58.080> guess<00:00:58.290> there's<00:00:58.470> like<00:00:58.500> no<00:00:58.860> multiplayer

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I guess there's like no multiplayer

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.960 
I guess there's like no multiplayer
which<00:00:59.610> is<00:00:59.760> amazing<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.720> game<00:01:00.900> because<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.979 
which is amazing for this game because I
can't<00:01:02.970> believe<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.330> won't<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.659> multiplayer

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
can't believe they won't do multiplayer

can't believe they won't do multiplayer

a<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:01.590> bit<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> loading<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:03.120> this<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
a little bit of loading and this game is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.830 
a little bit of loading and this game is
very<00:02:04.260> odd<00:02:04.470> because<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.159> loads<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.850> there's<00:02:06.510> no

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
very odd because it loads and there's no

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
very odd because it loads and there's no
like<00:02:07.409> loading<00:02:07.979> icon'<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> black

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
like loading icon' it's just a black

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.870 
like loading icon' it's just a black
screen<00:02:09.979> which<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.130> kind<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.340> odd<00:02:11.520> you'd<00:02:11.760> think

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
screen which is kind of odd you'd think

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.670 
screen which is kind of odd you'd think
they'd<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:13.260> know<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.530> Death

they'd have like a you know the Death
Star<00:02:13.980> something<00:02:14.430> floating<00:02:14.760> around<00:02:14.880> again<00:02:15.270> or

Star something floating around again or
something<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.160> now<00:02:17.340> ever<00:02:17.610> watch<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.420> the

actually lengthy load times on all of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually lengthy load times on all of
them<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.730> being<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> 3ds<00:03:19.110> with<00:03:19.440> new

them so being on the 3ds with new
hardware<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.850> not<00:03:21.120> surprising<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:23.670> can

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
hardware it's not surprising as you can

hardware it's not surprising as you can
see<00:03:24.200> lightsabers

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
see lightsabers

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.319

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
look just as good as they do the

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.720 
look just as good as they do the
graphics<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.110> full<00:03:28.380> game<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.860> integrated<00:03:29.579> in

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
graphics the full game is integrated in

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.500 
graphics the full game is integrated in
here

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
here

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.030 
here
this<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.019> actually<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> mission<00:03:31.620> right<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:32.010> I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
this is actually a mission right here I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.470 
this is actually a mission right here I
believe<00:03:32.660> not<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:33.870> sure<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> menus<00:03:36.150> are<00:03:36.450> a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
believe not really sure the menus are a

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.509 
believe not really sure the menus are a
little<00:03:37.140> different<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:37.530> though<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.100> don't

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
little different I think though I don't

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.590 
little different I think though I don't
think<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.060> how<00:03:39.269> they<00:03:39.420> look<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
think this is how they look on the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.569 
think this is how they look on the
normal<00:03:42.600> one<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.320> could<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> story<00:03:44.040> free

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
normal one but you could do story free

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.440 
normal one but you could do story free
play<00:03:44.790> whatever<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.209> want

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
play whatever you want

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.410 
play whatever you want
push<00:03:47.410> start<00:03:47.739> actually<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.819> loaded<00:03:49.209> really

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
push start actually that loaded really

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.570 
push start actually that loaded really
fast<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:50.680> then<00:03:50.830> they<00:03:50.920> have<00:03:51.010> these<00:03:51.129> loading

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
fast but then they have these loading

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.220 
fast but then they have these loading
for<00:03:51.910> like<00:03:52.180> where<00:03:52.450> they<00:03:52.569> build<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.930> actual

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
for like where they build the actual

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.300 
for like where they build the actual
block<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.590> they<00:03:53.680> put<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.920> levels<00:03:54.190> together

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
block so they put the levels together

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.009 
block so they put the levels together
they<00:03:54.910> take<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.150> while<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.810> it's<00:03:56.800> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:56.980> weird

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
they take a while so it's kind of weird

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.600 
they take a while so it's kind of weird
but<00:03:59.019> once<00:03:59.170> we<00:03:59.290> get<00:03:59.410> in<00:03:59.590> here<00:03:59.860> you<00:04:00.310> guys<00:04:00.430> can

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
but once we get in here you guys can

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.160 
but once we get in here you guys can
actually<00:04:00.700> see<00:04:00.879> how<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.300> levels<00:04:01.750> are<00:04:01.870> set<00:04:01.989> up

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
actually see how the levels are set up

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.270 
actually see how the levels are set up
it's<00:04:03.040> really<00:04:03.989> graphically<00:04:04.989> you<00:04:05.080> guys<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:06.130> as

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it's really graphically you guys just as

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.009 
it's really graphically you guys just as
good<00:04:06.430> as<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.700> wee<00:04:06.819> one<00:04:07.030> for<00:04:07.239> sure<00:04:07.450> probably

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
good as the wee one for sure probably

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.930 
good as the wee one for sure probably
just<00:04:08.410> as<00:04:08.500> good<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.830> ps3<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.310> 360<00:04:09.459> ones

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
just as good as the ps3 and 360 ones

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.479 
just as good as the ps3 and 360 ones
because<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:11.080> smaller<00:04:11.769> screen<00:04:12.069> makes<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
because the smaller screen makes the

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.500 
because the smaller screen makes the
resolution<00:04:13.000> look<00:04:13.120> fantastic

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
resolution look fantastic

around<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.410> mission<00:04:29.590> here<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.919> could<00:04:30.040> EA

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
around in this mission here you could EA

around in this mission here you could EA
play<00:04:30.280> as<00:04:30.370> Yoda<00:04:30.610> right<00:04:30.820> away<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.000> think<00:04:31.800> yes<00:04:32.800> and

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
play as Yoda right away I think yes and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.530 
play as Yoda right away I think yes and
you<00:04:35.740> get<00:04:35.889> a<00:04:35.950> switch<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.400> L&amp;R<00:04:36.910> buttons<00:04:37.240> or

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
you get a switch with the L&amp;R buttons or

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.659 
you get a switch with the L&amp;R buttons or
else<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.990> think<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.560> actually<00:04:38.740> just<00:04:39.070> touch

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
else I think you can actually just touch

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.700 
else I think you can actually just touch
to<00:04:39.940> choose<00:04:40.150> your<00:04:40.300> character<00:04:40.479> yep

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
to choose your character yep

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.409 
to choose your character yep
so<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.430> just<00:04:42.580> touch<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.880> use<00:04:43.000> your<00:04:43.120> character

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
so you just touch to use your character

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.090 
so you just touch to use your character
and<00:04:43.600> this<00:04:45.510> when<00:04:46.510> you<00:04:46.600> push<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.350> that

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
and this when you push up like that that

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.980 
and this when you push up like that that
does<00:04:48.370> your<00:04:48.550> force<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.419> believe

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.180 

although<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.020> don't<00:04:53.230> know<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.980> you<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.370> I

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
although I don't know that you can I

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.870 
although I don't know that you can I
don't<00:04:57.190> know<00:04:57.340> if<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.520> could<00:04:57.640> do<00:04:57.730> it<00:04:57.790> with

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
don't know if you could do it with

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.460 
don't know if you could do it with
anything<00:04:58.150> else<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.540> think<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.780> might<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.260> to

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
anything else I think you might have to

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.560 
anything else I think you might have to
use<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.830> which<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.070> kind<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.430> dumb<00:05:00.700> I<00:05:01.090> rather

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
use that which is kind of dumb I rather

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.050 
use that which is kind of dumb I rather
just<00:05:01.690> push<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.050> button<00:05:02.140> but<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:03.190> know<00:05:03.310> I'm<00:05:03.610> all
