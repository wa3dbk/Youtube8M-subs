hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:01.410> nice<00:00:01.920> Mart<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:03.810> have

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hey guys I'm nice Mart and today I have

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey guys I'm nice Mart and today I have
a<00:00:04.440> prototype<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.490> something<00:00:06.029> very<00:00:06.270> cool<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
a prototype for something very cool and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830 
a prototype for something very cool and
this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.740> basically<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.160> new<00:00:08.490> concept<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.450> yeah

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
this is basically a new concept so yeah

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.410 
this is basically a new concept so yeah
let's<00:00:10.139> test<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> we're<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
let's test it out so we're going to

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.410 
let's test it out so we're going to
touch<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.900> ball<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.610> something<00:00:14.610> activates

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
touch the ball and something activates

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.380 
touch the ball and something activates
and<00:00:15.719> basically<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.730> touch

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and basically what this is is a touch

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.800 
and basically what this is is a touch
activated<00:00:19.050> button<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:21.060> any<00:00:21.359> block

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
activated button and it can be any block

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
activated button and it can be any block
he<00:00:22.050> does<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.740> quartz<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> set<00:00:23.970> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
he does have to be quartz you can set it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.420 
he does have to be quartz you can set it
to<00:00:24.119> any<00:00:24.570> block<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.170> possible<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:25.920> Pistons

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
to any block that is possible by Pistons

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.980 
to any block that is possible by Pistons
and<00:00:26.930> yes<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.699> guess<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and yes so I guess that's that so it's

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.340 
and yes so I guess that's that so it's
pretty<00:00:31.189> simple<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.809> from

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
pretty simple as you can see but from

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.709 
pretty simple as you can see but from
the<00:00:34.500> behind<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.190> redstone<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.420> simple

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the behind the redstone is not so simple

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.549 
the behind the redstone is not so simple
and<00:00:37.940> yeah<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.180> only<00:00:39.870> wants<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> showcase

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and yeah actually only wants to showcase

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.310 
and yeah actually only wants to showcase
the<00:00:41.309> rest<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.670> creation<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the rest on creation this time because I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
the rest on creation this time because I
feel<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.250> could<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.550> improved<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
feel like it could be improved like it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930 
feel like it could be improved like it
could<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.079> compacted<00:00:46.739> maybe<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.670> way

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
could be compacted maybe there's a way

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
could be compacted maybe there's a way
to<00:00:47.969> make<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.600> flush<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.530> wall<00:00:49.710> without

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to make it flush with the wall without

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.319 
to make it flush with the wall without
having<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> corner<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.590> this

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
having to put it in a corner like this

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
having to put it in a corner like this
but<00:00:54.329> yes<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.320> guys<00:00:55.440> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> improve

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
but yes so if you guys want to improve

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
but yes so if you guys want to improve
this<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> provide<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> world<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
this I'm going to provide a world out in

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
this I'm going to provide a world out in
the<00:00:58.559> description<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> link<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the description as well as a link to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.160 
the description as well as a link to the
schematic<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.460> yeah<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.789> basically<00:01:03.570> how

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
schematic and yeah and basically how

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
schematic and yeah and basically how
this<00:01:04.379> works<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:05.450> simple<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> push

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this works is simple so when you push

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.710 
this works is simple so when you push
the<00:01:09.150> minecart

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the minecart

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
the minecart
you<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:10.470> cannot<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.369> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you actually cannot see it from this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
you actually cannot see it from this
side<00:01:11.970> by<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> cannot<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
side by the way so you cannot see it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
side by the way so you cannot see it
from<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.100> side<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.580> from<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.540> see

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
from this side but from here you can see

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.980 
from this side but from here you can see
it<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> push<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> go

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it and when you push it is going to go

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340 
it and when you push it is going to go
and<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.009> detector<00:01:20.549> rail<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and so this detector rail and it is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
and so this detector rail and it is
variants<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> detect<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> minecart

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
variants to detect the minecart

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
variants to detect the minecart
is<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.659> push<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> detector<00:01:25.530> rail<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is going to push the detector rail on so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
is going to push the detector rail on so
here<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> retract<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
here and then is going to retract the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.179 
here and then is going to retract the
book<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> detector<00:01:30.270> rail<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.189> then

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
book the or the detector rail and then

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.740 
book the or the detector rail and then
it's<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> make<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> minecart<00:01:33.509> fall

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's going to make the minecart fall

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's going to make the minecart fall
down<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.430> yeah<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.810> up

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
down and yeah now it's going to go up

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.310 
down and yeah now it's going to go up
and<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.549> push<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.320> detector

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and here is going to push the detector

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.859 
and here is going to push the detector
rail<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> block<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.869> here's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
rail back on to the block and here's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.520 
rail back on to the block and here's
going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.619> up<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:45.530> here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
going to go up all the way here here

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010 
going to go up all the way here here
we've<00:01:46.649> got<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> detector<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> go

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
we've got a detector so it's going to go

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.090 
we've got a detector so it's going to go
here<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.540> book<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> can

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here on to this book here and as you can

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
here on to this book here and as you can
see<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> enemy<00:01:53.820> its<00:01:54.390> hitbox<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.710> bit

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
see the enemy its hitbox is a little bit

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
see the enemy its hitbox is a little bit
smaller<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.430> normal<00:01:56.460> book<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
smaller than a normal book and that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.190 
smaller than a normal book and that's
what<00:01:58.020> makes<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.439> possible<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> let<00:02:00.899> me<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
what makes it possible so let me just

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.219 
what makes it possible so let me just
demonstrate<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> guess<00:02:02.790> maybe<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.899> are<00:02:03.960> fast

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
demonstrate it I guess maybe we are fast

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.410 
demonstrate it I guess maybe we are fast
enough<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
enough to see it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.680 
enough to see it
so<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.780> see<00:02:08.840> goes<00:02:09.350> up<00:02:09.619> voice<00:02:10.009> here<00:02:10.460> and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so as you can see goes up voice here and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.490 
so as you can see goes up voice here and
goes<00:02:11.690> down<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.030> manages<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.510> hit<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.110> elbow

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
goes down so it manages to hit the elbow

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.280 
goes down so it manages to hit the elbow
and<00:02:15.710> gets<00:02:16.130> aligned<00:02:16.610> properly<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.600> then<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and gets aligned properly and then it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.180 
and gets aligned properly and then it
just<00:02:18.470> drops<00:02:18.770> down<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.060> guess<00:02:20.300> that's<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.750> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
just drops down and I guess that's it so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.630 
just drops down and I guess that's it so
anyways<00:02:22.190> again<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:23.990> is<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.140> showcase<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.070> if
