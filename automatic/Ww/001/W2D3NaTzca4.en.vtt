00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.350

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.640
 help them with this 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.540
 if you are currently on the Stubai piste at the moment, especially at the moment 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.440
 eager Rehn runners over the way then he could be there 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.589
 around the relatives of the Pakistani 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.489
 National team trades whole 20 members has the park is 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.179
 Pakistani ski federation forest beer tent and ran Tel and other training 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.379
 Righteousness of the facilities exist in the passport Iraqi country but not the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.060
 Team is therefore with much ambition in the luggage in the Stubaital which is there 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.550
 is trained and that really she'll be like ten with good believes 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.549
 has 1 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.010
 they are a strong team 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 and they are all on 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 the terrestrial winter games 2010 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.890
 until then, there is only one criminal train and no one for them 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.680
 the BFH old as my parents would certainly very good skier 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.570
 would bring and Pakistan branch 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.250
 Men are all in the world now 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.120
 the weather then I had twelve years old had the Pakistani 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.500
 Luftwaffe gives empathy 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 and as I started learning to ski 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.130
 Water then becomes the Bilderberger the honorary Peter Riecke 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 participate in the 2010 Olympic Games the beard and then right 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.870
 that he has learned in Tyrol with the children at home in Pakistan 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.210
 contributions 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 in their native country Pakistan, they grew up right 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 They all come from a small village in northern Pakistan at 3000 meters 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 Elevation 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.370
 Some of the highest peaks in the world are nearby 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.660
 but skiing as we know it does not exist there of course no ps-kink 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.030
 no lifts 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 when we get to the yard of recovery 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.420
 but hardly that Nowitzki m Peter Haber 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.450
 but we have the best snow the powder snow to lay to the people it is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.370
 just a matter of time until we arouse the interest of our business people 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 can 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.269
 Here the parents lived in the square on the far side of the sea 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.169
 since then billions 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:21.309
 that the 8 boys in the age between 14 and 28 years in Tyrol for their 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.189
 can train big dream 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.949
 he needs help for that 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.389
 equipped with a meager budget of the Pakistani military attack in 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.889
 the ski and sports films and especially ski schools and mountain railways in Stubai 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:39.589
 OK for that they are highly motivated and disciplined yes they are 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.110
 Lungs secretly ambitious 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.119
 "She has to be very narrow 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.919
 they want to go there are federal because it forces themselves to imagine 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.239
 the best way is to get a preview of what they are coming to in the hall at least 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:51.899
 millions 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.329
 if nothing has threaded the whole thing, a Tyrolean mountain guide 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.749
 who was in Pakistan for his own expeditions several times and made initial contacts there 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.859
 we just have to be able to concretely square meters and quickly 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.399
 like me that kids did it earlier 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.249
 Humor crooked and slow commissar 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.499
 but typical oneself and redundancy Olaf second or third 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.219
 the Tradegate as a reason a certain Palacios devices 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 So you can not imagine that anymore 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.990
 the times when a runner so-called exotic countries 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.789
 Followed and managed practically a continuation of the Olympic Games 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.559
 Who wants to be olympic? 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.409
 must be among the top five hundredths of the world 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.289
 that is a hard way 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.140
 but with Steve without support 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 you want to be asked
