00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 Do you have a skateboarding movie in the city of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.680
 São Paulo, this is the best attention in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 truth is the name is a is that a 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 contrast with São Paulo is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.880
 because it 's not a city ​​they say so 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 some 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 I just wanted to show that a way of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.029
 skaters can get away with knowing 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.590
 all this chaos and skateboarding that the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 team is doing and enjoying the city 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 in a way that ordinary people are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.130
 So let's not enjoy it, huh? 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 we had a different idea then 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.350
 by a completely opposite way 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 in the world everyone in the world 1 billion 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.199
 that is traditional that you are part of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.710
 thousand people claim this part of the world 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.629
 country but with a huge difference that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 it was the first time a person was going to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 show for skate crosses the neighborhood 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.869
 to see how a document from the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.430
 city ​​knows what we like 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.710
 also wanted to show this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 socio-cultural diversity that make up the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 Sao Paulo 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 we chose the center of são paulo 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.720
 because he is the center of so many 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.750
 so much diversity both the arteries and 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.060
 which even took the center and that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.369
 feeling of chaos but the chaotic session 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.979
 It seems like you can not even 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.600
 walk or imagine being because he was 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.700
 to pass between people in all that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 fan to inform me year and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 skate at a higher speed 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.310
 I think it was good, he said he had a way 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 they provide many things 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.940
 freedom to test that we 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 even tried to mix this language more 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.619
 cinematographic a skateboarding movie with 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.800
 that chay with the language says caliente 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.800
 same 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.860
 and then we have an idea of the script 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.110
 each through a city neighborhood 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.450
 wearing the same outfit to look like there is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.190
 same day and wear clothes even three 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.660
 years wanted to kill me at the end of 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.430
 process that could not stand the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.890
 but it's showing that we're attacking and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.470
 everybody football that was difficult 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.540
 because he had to wear the same sneakers 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.630
 checks the same clothes, the shirt that I 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.980
 he repeatedly tore the cause that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.020
 Sewing came so much that it came home and 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.300
 if they had organized themselves to wash the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.300
 clothes that leave ready for another day 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.770
 people like that arrive in the place to film 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.420
 maneuver 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.310
 you run the risk the guy would not sit 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.319
 99 we came back more than 15 months to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 be established, rather than for the concept of 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.459
 skate video she has to be difficult 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260
 There's got to be so much I can not do. 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.940
 miss the time the right guy because he is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 too hard to do again can not 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.260
 miss 200 times but I can not 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.849
 I think it's going to show sao paulo 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.140
 The way the guys are doing a lot 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.700
 accustomed to seeing no 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.180
 in são paulo the points of which the galera 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.580
 skateboard also forgotten will take 14.9 day 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.530
 There are plenty of people there who are so 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.810
 degraded so discouraging that no one 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.970
 more are here in the see would also only have 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.860
 sold the galera not what when skate 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.269
 kind of you give a life for a place 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.310
 maybe this video of a new inspiration 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:46.769
 So, guys, back in these places years. 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.480
 That's because I think it 's a movie. 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.610
 I felt that the essence of skateboarding is 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.620
 the more you live your lifestyle 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.959
 civil non-civil 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.299
 and we do not care if the guy is 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.430
 five-time world skate champion is really 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.110
 It does not matter what matters. 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.640
 cape davis cup he made 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.829
 which part of video he did that 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.810
 influenced a generation after that 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.730
 know the song that they what he used the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.110
 that discovers artist discovers the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.790
 influences of artists and ends up 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.440
 researching a lot of things knows 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.660
 as well as dedicate three years of his life 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.889
 trying to make the best maneuver that can 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.560
 do 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.930
 I think that more for me is worth much more. 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.860
 penalty than to have won any 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.860
 championship with jane 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.480
 to ademir 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.149
 in April and 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.149
 is
