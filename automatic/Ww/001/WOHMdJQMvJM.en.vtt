00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.300
 but also stefan the free himself with it is my goal to win 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.929
 follow but also the zero steps to keep 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.259
 what your team has will be given for next Sunday 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.649
 Well no 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.230
 I haven't given them that yet, but I have 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 Of course we agreed to be that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 encounter goals too easily from standard situations and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
 we also have to worry about the remains 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.940
 yes there we wanted to play a good match and 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.620
 what you are doing 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.590
 continue that line and they win 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 entry team against an opponent lower on specific assignments 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.750
 another assignment from another competitions 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.080
 we have had to play from our strong and that is a pity offensive 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.210
 that getting better football is better 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.910
 the interaction with 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 calling is getting better and better 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.120
 well there many players benefit from it 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.989
 for the most part also not quite often in such situations 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 because he dico can make the return higher 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.540
 must also be called that is clear though 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.020
 He will get there and also the sides with the early for September because he wants 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480
 also a lot of scroll print 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.450
 well that is getting better and better 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.810
 and in which there used to be 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.780
 that a point of attention was that we created too little offensive is that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.140
 in particular 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.100
 very good in home games 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 you saw scapegoat pellÃ¨ a number of times a player got involved 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 predicted young people can change their role in that regard in the team 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 that is always the case and also with us it was someone in the beginning 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.020
 find who knows what he wants and how he wants to be played 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.150
 and thereby have to accommodate people who 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.550
 useless that is people are often also not defensible 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 if you see that against roda that people involved in all goals and you can too 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.630
 with him 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.420
 at times a bit more opportunistic, the newspaper rather plays tall ball high 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.730
 play ball 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.040
 a lot has come out that can still be improved 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.259
 and that part has certainly improved greatly 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.269
 unfortunately three years is fixed at mb s at parma 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.519
 and then you get that 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.189
 you know that if you 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.799
 send a player 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.650
 In addition 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.300
 if they do that every year 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.360
 a peak in the spring that is not that important well then we will 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.650
 jamaican last year is just about animals counter goals is also one 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.100
 matter of concern though he has doubted to do in particular you think 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.069
 the hook I think it's a number of things lies a number of things one is already 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.500
 authenticity that it takes way too long and too much time when we really position 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.549
 are defending that we are about the situation in the country 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.049
 that also shows when the second club falls out of the second goal 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.719
 a short corner then 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.430
 there are still so many players in the sixteen that race don't even agree with the face 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.200
 the situation is still there 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.419
 the sixteen meters in an open bus 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:04.399
 it starts with 10 it starts with the organization as quickly as possible in your position 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.969
 and fulfill agreements and be included in those agreements 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.919
 made mistakes 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.220
 and the and and and that is not allowed 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.360
 agrees that those kinds of moments we have to do a lot for it 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.949
 opportunities to turn and have the return but 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.579
 we get too easy still moments, of course that is very important 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.339
 part of the game 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.349
 but we have enough length 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.789
 if you looked like he could 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.869
 you can take into account what more often the purchase against permanent members chosen and 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:39.309
 so it is about the duel what is the position of a direct opponent and 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.529
 that all needs to be better and the number for mid-neck winners in midfield 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.209
 options further too big maybe win in venlo retail group with an assist 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.939
 not good 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.010
 in the Sunday cup match not in the selection but what is he on this 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.969
 moment 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.019
 you already give it to the group is very big so whatever we look at 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.859
 is 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.180
 no the return the level that players keep on training and because they are at the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.049
 promises 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.339
 yes and then make the choice that deserves more 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.459
 and then the other to be with the group and that is a left-wing opposition and others 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.739
 side it is not always the most pleasant position of the event 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.999
 You have to disappoint a lot of players and that is sometimes difficult 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.930
 to make 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.930
 we have chosen this and everyone is fit 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.960
 well mbo incisions came to the group 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.370
 and then there is a winter break for a moment 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.510
 in this which to indicate what future is at this club 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.410
 we also notice that for you by top trainer who is concrete in utrecht 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.350
 has increased 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.840
 the notes of years ago 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.250
 that more struggle is being fought also cannot say after and in at times 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.870
 but it can still be better because you always have to deal with players 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.830
 that the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.530
 who are disappointed and who are not in the group or not even on the couch 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.330
 to sit 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.449
 well then you come up with a motivational problem that player can 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.280
 that keep bringing what is asked to that is not for every player 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.169
 not every player can not afford it with us either
