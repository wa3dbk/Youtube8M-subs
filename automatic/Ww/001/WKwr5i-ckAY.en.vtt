00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.730
 Juan Carlos Herrero Thank you very much for being here with us for a hundred 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.730
 difficult year previous but now it seems that has rebounded 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.169
 if last year with year the complicated ones do not 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.230
 the years of going back many things not physically 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.610
 maybe I did not find myself one hundred percent but pro bono towards the end of the year 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.570
 number 23 made a good number the plot to try to catch 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.390
 this year with much desire 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.900
 percent it is said that in the second airs and of malmo 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.620
 it was rumored long ago that maybe it was like that 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.890
 a little tired of the tour 0 q the last weeks excellent performance 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.720
 as dc sun a very good end of the year 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.000
 what comes to you 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.350
 good yes they are 12 years of career nothing tennis world and safe 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 that with so much travel and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.020
 and so much stress of the competition I know what I sometimes get tired of but 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.299
 pro bono this year as one of me take it 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.869
 maybe a little bit another way to try to enjoy more of what is the turn 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.020
 Travel and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.329
 and now that one of the moment started 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.480
 very well the year maybe they bring us support for an ankle injury but here 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.000
 this week I'm doing very well two arak titles in acapulco because 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.900
 try 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.180
 for the best that I can 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.550
 you already have some idea of ​​carlos g although he denied faa 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.170
 to recover that step that dedecker is going to happen we are expanding that carlos 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.260
 moyá for example 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.840
 have more than everything and still eager to continue 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 you have thought of something of that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.950
 or you never know that it also depends on many things of how one is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.750
 physically in each case I think that is very different 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.840
 of motivation 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.490
 the ranquin nando soccer 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.410
 All those things 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.170
 It depends a lot on himself there but we believe that right now we do not go back to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.930
 think 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.760
 in rates thing because physically I feel good I ranked myself from I'm not 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.110
 very good and gondola forum going well so for now 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.970
 let's leave for a time to think about those things 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.859
 Well, because many people walk a lot in Spain 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.909
 for example p the greatest idol of prezista he the title of the athlete 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.530
 of the year of King Juan Carlos that gives you all that as a phone call after a 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:10.779
 pride for oneself I do not wish you many years of sacrifice and receive 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.909
 a prize if it was Spanish level 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.440
 the most important one, for me, it was a great satisfaction and 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.309
 motivation to continue working 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.929
 Juan Carlos with a little bit of your life off the field 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.519
 you have a hotel has its sister cup tympanum does 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.329
 bombshell good yes I have percent knows about future things not investments 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.509
 of future that are important I have put a hotel 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.799
 according to tennis academy it would be good now and I do not also have 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.299
 as a partner of ferrer in what is the tournament or the Valencia 500 open and 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.829
 livorno are conson activities and what to do in the future because I bonus the plane 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.439
 tennis players just relatively short do not go bonuses to which he entered in time with 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.629
 you were quite busy in all these things and did not plan on family 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.129
 knows then all vienna in house civera that I have two sisters and and well there 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.599
 we are going there today because a hotel and not for example a motorcycle dealership 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.800
 It was cars that we know you love 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.189
 siena the ere 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.389
 seriously that 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.049
 percent suffered the the idea arose the idea to go and the ground arose 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.210
 that was close to 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.590
 but I live and we took advantage of the the the opportunity not only left us much 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.459
 Like very much 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.739
 the world of hospitality and 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.099
 the tamale that will be working we have very well covered because we have 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.959
 backs of other genres 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.919
 ii and in the girl his wife who also takes that somelier so buzz o 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.839
 very happy with them and 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.199
 likewise they threaten the future of pemex are important 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.799
 foye in that same 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.339
 familiar roll ep your mom you entered the tennis she died a long time ago 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:45.869
 he had peace 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.679
 and also toni that has been with you as a second father since childhood 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:50.969
 against madonna 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.219
 with the ipad is a band very important work is very clear Tony I think 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.060
 who consumes more or parents a is a very trustworthy person is not a good 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.859
 coach 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.180
 but he is a person who came from the end with him from 10 years and 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.819
 Borja person trust for all my family 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.979
 for me and well we hope to continue all the time I have left of detention 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:14.360
 concentrate this change from being a child to adults and not living a life 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.240
 normal 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.269
 here in Mexico there is a problem in that change 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.370
 good youth players who suddenly can not grow anal in the tour 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.289
 professional 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.279
 at the beginning it costs a lot because it is a very radical change and it is clear 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.879
 what 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.219
 what the competition that is now is very smooth is very difficult not and when 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.050
 you are little, the jump to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.380
 pascual with the professionals very complicated and the livorno when one is 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.650
 make 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.320
 known for more yet not because that life is complicated at first it depends 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.180
 also of of the attitude of each one if he is very introverted extroverted all 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.480
 the world doors or some problem but but good are things that 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.229
 they learn 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.620
 has taken to see over time he said and now we have fulfilled 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.860
 p finally returning to professional life 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.009
 a great slam the end of the day that had titles of country konko with spain that 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.870
 is that it leaves you as it is different is the same as you give more weight 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.689
 good are very different things is not for your country the cup dibise that we are going 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.139
 have a great success we have a team that took a lot of time demonstrated 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:16.710
 in type 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.699
 very young with many possibilities to play well on any surface and that 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.139
 I think it's very important for the unemployed for a country like Spain 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.729
 and I say no on an individual level because I feel like revering willingly, it's not the micro 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.080
 Seeing a player makes him grow as a tennis player and other skills 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.379
 I think that in the unforgettable the number one for good any tennis player 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.099
 what what 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.189
 train in fight every day to approach this number or be what 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:44.370
 higher possible 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.089
 and they are good 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.719
 victories and different achievements but that each one of them because he is a 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.669
 very important satisfaction 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.279
 Juan Carlos something that I want to encourage for the public here in Mexico as 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.620
 the tournament here acapulco the tournament will be fantastic, very comfortable the 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.379

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.409

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.909

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.809
 almost every night and that once thank you that the audience 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:13.539

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.529

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.360
 something else houses point 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.180
