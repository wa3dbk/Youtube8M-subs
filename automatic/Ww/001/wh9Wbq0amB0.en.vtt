that<00:01:56.670> takes<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.660> maintain<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.860> keep<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
that takes to maintain it and to keep it

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.530 
that takes to maintain it and to keep it
going<00:02:00.890> first<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> fence<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:02.910> most

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
going first you need to fence it in most

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.540 
going first you need to fence it in most
areas<00:02:03.750> required<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:04.500> fence<00:02:04.800> but

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.210 
in 2008 the cost would be closer to 100
dollars<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.830> pay<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.010> the

dollars then you have to pay for the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
dollars then you have to pay for the
utilities<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.940> first<00:02:36.750> thing<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> have

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410

utilities the first thing is if you have
a<00:02:37.440> gas<00:02:37.739> heater<00:02:38.400> you'll<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.150> paying<00:02:39.360> for<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
a gas heater you'll be paying for the

a gas heater you'll be paying for the

your<00:02:45.090> gas<00:02:45.330> costs<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:45.959> probably<00:02:46.350> about<00:02:46.709> 11<00:02:47.310> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
your gas costs are probably about 11 to

12<00:02:47.610> dollars<00:02:47.820> an<00:02:48.120> hour<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.690> every<00:02:48.959> hour<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
12 dollars an hour for every hour you

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.620 
12 dollars an hour for every hour you
run<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.860> heater<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:51.180> pool<00:02:51.420> water

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
run the heater the pool water

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.330 
run the heater the pool water
temperature<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.320> only<00:02:52.440> rise<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> few<00:02:53.130> degrees

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
temperature will only rise a few degrees

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.420 
temperature will only rise a few degrees
in<00:02:53.820> an<00:02:53.910> hour<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:55.320> best<00:02:55.620> guesstimate<00:02:56.250> then

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
in an hour so best guesstimate then

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.860 
in an hour so best guesstimate then
would<00:02:56.610> be<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.970> raise<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.390> pool<00:02:57.570> temperature

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
would be to raise the pool temperature

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.470 
would be to raise the pool temperature
10<00:02:58.380> degrees<00:02:58.709> would<00:02:59.010> cost<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.549> about<00:02:59.640> 85<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
10 degrees would cost you about 85 to

10 degrees would cost you about 85 to
100<00:03:00.780> dollars<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.299> have<00:03:03.390> a

secure one but they can run as low as
$100<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:33.150> solar-type<00:04:34.150> pool<00:04:34.510> cover<00:04:35.200> which

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
$100 for a solar-type pool cover which

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.760 
$100 for a solar-type pool cover which
would<00:04:35.919> keep<00:04:36.130> your<00:04:36.400> pool<00:04:36.610> warmer

and then lastly you have to buy toys it

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.719 
and then lastly you have to buy toys it
gets<00:04:40.139> started<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.710> would<00:04:41.130> guesstimate<00:04:41.669> that

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
you can easily spend a hundred dollars

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.790 
you can easily spend a hundred dollars
on<00:04:44.509> toys<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.590> new<00:04:46.740> pool<00:04:48.530> now<00:04:49.530> we<00:04:49.590> have

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
on toys for a new pool now we have

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.589 
on toys for a new pool now we have
looked<00:04:49.919> at<00:04:50.069> the<00:04:50.190> cost<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:50.910> pool<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.479> how

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
looked at the cost of the pool and how

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.390 
looked at the cost of the pool and how
much<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:51.900> gonna<00:04:51.960> cost<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.440> maintain<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.069> so

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
much it's gonna cost to maintain it so

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.550 
much it's gonna cost to maintain it so
let's<00:04:53.580> put<00:04:53.789> these<00:04:53.910> all<00:04:54.120> together<00:04:54.560> assuming
