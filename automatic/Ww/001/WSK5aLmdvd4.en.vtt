00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
to edit this firstly put in why and then

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.510 
to edit this firstly put in why and then
we're<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.670> perform<00:03:45.590> do<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> fun<00:03:46.920> put<00:03:47.430> font

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
we're going to perform do a fun put font

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.830 
we're going to perform do a fun put font
space<00:03:50.520> V<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:55.769> equals<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:57.239> do<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.570> speech

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
space V then equals then do a speech

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.280 
space V then equals then do a speech
bark<00:03:58.170> an<00:03:59.130> aerial<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.660> then<00:04:00.870> we'll<00:04:00.959> close<00:04:01.140> the

bark an aerial and then we'll close the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.410 
bark an aerial and then we'll close the
speech<00:04:01.530> block<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:03.180> then<00:04:03.450> close<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.680> route<00:04:05.420> to

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
speech block and then close the route to

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.259
