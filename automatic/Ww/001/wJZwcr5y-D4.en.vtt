think that he doesn't fit well into the
Real<00:01:36.990> Madrid<00:01:37.350> squad<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Real Madrid squad and the thing is that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.140 
Real Madrid squad and the thing is that
dimaria<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> right-wing<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.030> left-wing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
dimaria is the right-wing or left-wing

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050 
dimaria is the right-wing or left-wing
that<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:43.200> either<00:01:43.290> play<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.399> Isco

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that I can either play there but Isco

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.359 
that I can either play there but Isco
and<00:01:45.240> dimaria<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.799> he<00:01:46.979> gets<00:01:47.189> out

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

mark I don't know maybe he's good in the
lower<00:02:19.600> leagues<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.380> think<00:02:20.560> I've<00:02:20.740> kind<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
lower leagues I just think I've kind of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.340 
lower leagues I just think I've kind of
missed<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.820> him<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.150> obviously<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:22.750> why

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
missed out him and obviously that's why

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.310 
missed out him and obviously that's why
my<00:02:23.830> opinions<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:25.870> do<00:02:25.990> have<00:02:26.050> a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
my opinions that way so we do have a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.990 
my opinions that way so we do have a
