00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.999
 but found nothing 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.439

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.040
 Petersburg 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.270
 8th 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.270
 I thought I would have been 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 Arbon 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.789
 that he afterwards 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.859
 I'm not sure 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.859
 Year but if he says so 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 South Africa rar 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.199

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.199
 Zoetermeer we can live 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 that was the first half of Migros 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.559
 when I look around and look for the others 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.719
 back to New York 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.719
 the business is so 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.659
 what does that mean he comes over 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.579
 there were difficulties in our Leader offices 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.579
 He comes over and stuffs the leak 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.959
 Financial markets no longer see value 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.909
 Difficulties in our offices were the cops 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.869
 he is already interested in the offices 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.689

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.769

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.180
 but what he is 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.620
 Forgetting Maron is simply the boss is on his way to slow things down from 1 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.080
 we knew that it would come so take care of the shop here and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 ensures that his visit goes smoothly across the stage 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.580
 what was happening 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.580
