player<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.140> also<00:00:29.410> did<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.430> every<00:00:31.150> single

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
thought of being so this game took

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
thought of being so this game took
forever<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:06.360> 15<00:02:06.750> minute<00:02:06.930> quarters<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.410> was

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
forever with 15 minute quarters it was
