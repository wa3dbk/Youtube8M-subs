00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and just let's start layering them like

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.600 
and just let's start layering them like
this<00:03:10.020> when<00:03:11.020> i'm<00:03:11.110> done<00:03:11.320> layering<00:03:11.590> i'll<00:03:12.310> show

you the end but i'm going in with black
and<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.270> taking<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:18.220> light

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and just taking really really light

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.710 
and just taking really really light
lines<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.540> then<00:03:20.500> making<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.760> push

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
lines like this and then making a push

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.060 
lines like this and then making a push
push<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.410> pull<00:03:23.740> up<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> leaf<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:26.070> push

down so there's kind of like a little
line<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.150> sign<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.510> leaf<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.020> can

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
line and sign the leaf so that you can

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.590 
line and sign the leaf so that you can
see<00:03:32.380> that<00:03:32.410> they're<00:03:32.650> kind<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.890> like<00:03:33.010> drawings

that's<00:03:43.480> black<00:03:43.780> it's<00:03:44.620> kind<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.920> cool<00:03:45.250> because

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that's black it's kind of cool because

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.490 
that's black it's kind of cool because

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
it so we're going to do that and then

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.170 
it so we're going to do that and then
that's<00:03:50.920> going<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.160> unify<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180

that's going to unify all of the
different<00:03:52.570> um<00:03:54.239> stems<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.570> flowers<00:03:55.959> so

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
different um stems for the flowers so

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.120 
different um stems for the flowers so
