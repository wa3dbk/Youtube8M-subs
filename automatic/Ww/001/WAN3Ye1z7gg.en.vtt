really<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.219> facing<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.389> another<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:34.319> my

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
really be facing one another in my

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.349 
really be facing one another in my
opinion<00:01:34.709> anyway<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.639> fight<00:01:35.909> another<00:01:36.090> hand

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
opinion anyway this fight another hand

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.059 
opinion anyway this fight another hand
actually<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.959> a<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.469> good<00:01:37.829> fight

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
actually is a really really good fight

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.010 
actually is a really really good fight
because<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:40.619> tells<00:01:41.189> us<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.020> gustafson

because it tells us how good gustafson
really<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.700> know

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
really is because we really don't know

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.879 
really is because we really don't know
