tutorial on how to make a rapid fire
dispenser<00:00:11.730> there<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.900> ways<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.889> make

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
dispenser there are ways to make

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.810 
dispenser there are ways to make
dispensers<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> fire<00:00:16.130> normal<00:00:17.130> speeds<00:00:17.520> using

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
dispensers that fire normal speeds using

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.620 
dispensers that fire normal speeds using
pulsar's<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:19.410> various<00:00:19.920> kinds<00:00:20.270> which<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.480> will

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
pulsar's of various kinds which I will

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.189 
pulsar's of various kinds which I will
detail<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> video<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.930> they<00:00:24.930> didn't

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
detail in the video and they didn't

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.689 
detail in the video and they didn't
thing<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> haven't<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.400> been<00:00:26.609> able

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
thing is that I haven't really been able

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
thing is that I haven't really been able
to<00:00:26.939> find<00:00:27.269> too<00:00:28.140> many<00:00:28.260> videos<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.859> how<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> make

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
to find too many videos on how to make

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.990 
to find too many videos on how to make
fully<00:00:30.210> automatic<00:00:30.960> dispensers<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
fully automatic dispensers and that is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
fully automatic dispensers and that is
what<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.510> walk<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.380> through

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
what I'm going to walk people through

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.030 
what I'm going to walk people through
today<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.850> simple<00:00:36.480> concept<00:00:36.690> we'll<00:00:37.620> start

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
today very simple concept we'll start

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
today very simple concept we'll start
out<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:40.250> see<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:44.420> what<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.570> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
out with them see here what are we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.260 
out with them see here what are we
looking<00:00:45.930> ok<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.390> for<00:00:48.390> those<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.840> who<00:00:49.200> are

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
looking ok so for those of you who are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
looking ok so for those of you who are
slightly<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.770> redstone

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
slightly you know in two redstone

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
slightly you know in two redstone
already<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> works<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
already they know how it works for the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.400 
already they know how it works for the
most<00:00:54.899> part<00:00:55.670> I'll<00:00:56.670> start<00:00:56.940> off<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.750> rapid

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
most part I'll start off with the rapid

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.910 
most part I'll start off with the rapid
pulsar<00:00:59.449> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.989> torches<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pulsar this is the one with torches and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.630 
pulsar this is the one with torches and
redstone<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:03.080> opposed<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.250> ones<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
redstone as opposed to the ones with the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
redstone as opposed to the ones with the
actual<00:01:06.030> redstone<00:01:06.659> repeaters<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> will

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actual redstone repeaters which I will

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
actual redstone repeaters which I will
shout<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> later<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> basically<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.320> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
shout at you later so basically all this

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.399 
shout at you later so basically all this
does<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:12.650> flash<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> bunch<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:15.290> it'll<00:01:16.290> keep

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
does is flash a bunch and it'll keep

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
does is flash a bunch and it'll keep
going<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> makes<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.070> noise<00:01:18.350> what<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
going it makes a little noise what I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.480 
going it makes a little noise what I
want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> lead<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
want to do is kind of lead this out a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.140 
want to do is kind of lead this out a
little<00:01:20.549> ways<00:01:21.350> we'll<00:01:22.350> throw<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.950> block<00:01:23.850> right

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
little ways we'll throw a block right

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.569 
little ways we'll throw a block right
here<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:28.579> so

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579

well honey oh yeah I need love okay um
so<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.470> redstone<00:02:10.860> repeaters<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.519> miss

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so this redstone repeaters kind of miss

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.089 
so this redstone repeaters kind of miss
a<00:02:11.670> meal<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:14.540> throw<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.800> thing<00:02:19.950> out

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
a meal so I'm gonna throw this thing out

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.309 
a meal so I'm gonna throw this thing out
here<00:02:20.250> that'll<00:02:20.580> shut<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.879> up<00:02:20.940> okay<00:02:21.900> so

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
here that'll shut it up okay so

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
here that'll shut it up okay so
basically<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.129> will<00:02:23.310> be<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.549> lever<00:02:23.760> lever

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
basically this will be your lever lever

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.930 
basically this will be your lever lever
to<00:02:24.510> activate<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.160> turn<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.580> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
to activate it so like turn it on and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.960 
to activate it so like turn it on and
off<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.069> now<00:02:29.069> we<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.400> ahead<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.610> connect

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
off and now we can go ahead and connect

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.559 
off and now we can go ahead and connect
this<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.390> dispenser<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:33.150> fill<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
this to the dispenser and just fill the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.000 
this to the dispenser and just fill the
dispensers<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:37.010> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
dispensers there is there you go and so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.089 
dispensers there is there you go and so
right<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.870> turn<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.410> little<00:02:41.220> fire

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
right now if I turn this on little fire

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.250 
right now if I turn this on little fire
kind<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.280> okay<00:02:44.970> amino<00:02:45.390> fire<00:02:45.630> every<00:02:45.900> once<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.230> a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
kind of okay amino fire every once in a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.479 
kind of okay amino fire every once in a
while<00:02:46.410> there's<00:02:47.400> another<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:48.769> but<00:02:49.769> that's<00:02:50.340> not

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
while there's another one but that's not

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.039 
while there's another one but that's not
okay<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.700> me<00:02:50.849> i<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.060> my<00:02:51.209> dispensers<00:02:51.660> firing

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
okay with me i like my dispensers firing

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.580 
okay with me i like my dispensers firing
very<00:02:52.230> very<00:02:52.470> fast<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:54.170> here's<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.230> little<00:02:55.319> trick

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
very very fast so here's a little trick

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.370 
very very fast so here's a little trick
all<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.769> have<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.690> add<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:58.019> line<00:02:58.230> of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
all you have to do is add a line of

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.220 
all you have to do is add a line of
redstone<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.920> here<00:02:59.780> another<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.019> did

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
redstone right here another one that did

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.289 
redstone right here another one that did
that<00:03:01.260> I'll<00:03:01.500> trust<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.099> then<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.269> have

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
that I'll trust it and then all you have

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.650 
that I'll trust it and then all you have
to<00:03:03.450> do<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.660> make<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.840> currently<00:03:04.319> there<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.069> go

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
to do is make it currently there you go

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.479 
to do is make it currently there you go
so<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> seems<00:03:07.019> oddly<00:03:07.379> simple<00:03:07.799> but<00:03:07.980> doing<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
so it seems oddly simple but doing that

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.059 
so it seems oddly simple but doing that
and<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:09.329> see<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.630> go<00:03:09.780> back<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.620> activate<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
and now see if I go back and activate it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:22.340 
and now see if I go back and activate it
look<00:03:11.280> what<00:03:11.400> happens

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.920 

that's<00:03:23.350> pretty<00:03:23.560> much<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.740> i<00:03:23.920> mean<00:03:24.130> i<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.430> love
