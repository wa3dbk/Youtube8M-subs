00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.940 

so<00:00:01.650> now<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.280> was<00:00:02.760> putting<00:00:03.030> gas<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.350> this<00:00:04.350> car

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
so now I was putting gas in this car

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.940 
so now I was putting gas in this car
to<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.670> head<00:00:05.790> no<00:00:05.910> gas<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:09.650> there's<00:00:10.650> gas

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to the head no gas and there's gas

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.650 
to the head no gas and there's gas
leaking<00:00:10.980> right<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> side<00:00:17.600> but<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
leaking right here on the side but I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210 
leaking right here on the side but I
found<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> has<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> little<00:00:19.830> drainage

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
found out that it has a little drainage

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.590 
found out that it has a little drainage
a<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:21.859> green<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:23.269> through<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.359> hole

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
a little green thing through this hole

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:42.650 
a little green thing through this hole
right<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:39.200> when<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.410> gas<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.480> you're

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
right here so when the gas and you're

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
right here so when the gas and you're
putting<00:00:42.870> gas<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> comes<00:00:43.980> out

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
putting gas in out and it comes out

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.730 
putting gas in out and it comes out
right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> overflows<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:49.430> gas

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
right here or when the overflows the gas

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.240 
right here or when the overflows the gas
goes<00:00:52.400> through<00:00:52.700> here

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.220 

when<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.339> look<00:00:57.489> through<00:00:57.519> there<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.230> guess

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
when you look through there I guess

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.220 
when you look through there I guess
there's<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.469> little<00:00:59.710> line<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.690> drips<00:01:01.960> from

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
there's a little line and it drips from

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:19.560 
there's a little line and it drips from
don't<00:01:02.530> ya

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.630 

so<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.820> guests<00:01:23.050> leaking<00:01:24.050> down<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:25.370> falls

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
so the guests leaking down it falls

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.790 
so the guests leaking down it falls
right<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:30.320> pretty<00:01:30.620> much<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.210> a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
right here so so pretty much it's just a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.090 
right here so so pretty much it's just a
damn<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:34.040> know<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.580> square<00:01:34.790> have<00:01:34.910> a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
damn you know this square have a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.290 
damn you know this square have a
drainage<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.540> overflow<00:01:39.020> gas<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.970> I

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
drainage for the overflow gas so I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.410 
drainage for the overflow gas so I
decided<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.230> just<00:01:43.130> make<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> video<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.730> it<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
decided to just make a video on it so

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
decided to just make a video on it so
because<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.600> was<00:01:47.690> trying<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.930> put<00:01:48.080> gas<00:01:48.200> right

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
because I was trying to put gas right

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.990 
because I was trying to put gas right
now<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:48.740> thought<00:01:48.920> my<00:01:49.040> car<00:01:49.250> was<00:01:49.310> leaking<00:01:49.790> gas

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
now and I thought my car was leaking gas

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.470 
now and I thought my car was leaking gas
but<00:01:50.380> it's<00:01:51.380> not<00:01:51.680> just<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.910> gas<00:01:53.300> was

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
but it's not just the gas was

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.080 
but it's not just the gas was
overflowing<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.230> here<00:01:54.800> I'm<00:01:55.400> going<00:01:55.640> down<00:01:55.910> on

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
overflowing in here I'm going down on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:32.920 
overflowing in here I'm going down on
the<00:01:56.240> under<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> car<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:59.000> I<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:32.480> put<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> rag

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the under the car so I just put a rag

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.229 
the under the car so I just put a rag
down<00:02:33.170> here<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.830> don't<00:02:34.370> want<00:02:34.520> gas<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
down here so I don't want gas on the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.510 
down here so I don't want gas on the
floor
