also going to play around in the world
of<00:00:09.540> geometry<00:00:10.349> mode<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> start<00:00:11.610> off<00:00:11.730> with

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
of geometry mode so to start off with

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
of geometry mode so to start off with
let's<00:00:12.090> go<00:00:12.210> ahead<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.570> add<00:00:12.690> these<00:00:12.840> pillars<00:00:13.349> so

and<00:00:16.609> just<00:00:17.609> go<00:00:17.730> ahead<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.940> change<00:00:18.119> 256<00:00:18.930> through

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and just go ahead and change 256 through

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.750 
and just go ahead and change 256 through
the<00:00:19.230> Z<00:00:19.410> that's<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.070> height<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.490> pillars

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the Z that's the height of the pillars

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.929 
the Z that's the height of the pillars
and<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.420> 64<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.470> outer<00:00:22.619> radius<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.519> just

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and then 64 for our outer radius so just

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.310 
and then 64 for our outer radius so just
build<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> make<00:00:24.720> sure<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.199> the

build this and make sure you can see the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.820 
build this and make sure you can see the
brush<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.810> just<00:00:27.810> translate<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.769> into

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
brush and just translate this into

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.849 
brush and just translate this into
position<00:00:29.519> where<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.650> just

position where you want it and I just
make<00:00:31.949> sure<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.219> looking<00:00:32.460> good<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
make sure it's looking good in all the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
make sure it's looking good in all the
viewpoints<00:00:36.410> okay<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.530> looking<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
viewpoints okay it's looking good so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.420 
viewpoints okay it's looking good so
it's<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:38.700> CSU<00:00:39.300> add<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:40.070> remove<00:00:41.070> our<00:00:41.219> build

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's just CSU add this remove our build

it's just CSU add this remove our build
a<00:00:41.520> brush<00:00:41.930> laughter<00:00:43.010> how<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.309> remember<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a brush laughter how do they remember I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.229 
a brush laughter how do they remember I
build<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> brush<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.920> let's<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.850> our<00:00:48.000> old

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
build a brush and let's just use our old

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.860 
build a brush and let's just use our old
trick<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.780> clone<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.870> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
trick to clone this over here and the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.750 
trick to clone this over here and the
very<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.260> old<00:00:52.500> trick<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> clean<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.520> up

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
very same old trick to clean this up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.139 
very same old trick to clean this up
here<00:00:55.370> now<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.550> pearls<00:00:56.789> aren't<00:00:56.969> really

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here now these pearls aren't really

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
here now these pearls aren't really
necessary<00:00:57.559> but<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.770> feel<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.280> add

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
necessary but I feel they just add

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.889 
necessary but I feel they just add
something<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> map<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.359> let's<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.780> build

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
something to the map so let's just build

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.119 
something to the map so let's just build
a<00:01:01.050> geometry<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> our

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a geometry so we can see in our

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
a geometry so we can see in our
perspective<00:01:02.609> viewport<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> mouthful

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
perspective viewport that's a mouthful

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
perspective viewport that's a mouthful
and<00:01:05.119> okay<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.510> looks<00:01:06.720> quite<00:01:06.869> nice<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and okay I think I looks quite nice I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
and okay I think I looks quite nice I
already<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.530> feel<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> adds<00:01:08.010> something<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
already do feel it adds something to the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.929 
already do feel it adds something to the
map<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.560> added<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.860> pillars<00:01:11.250> let's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
map so now with added up pillars let's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.260 
map so now with added up pillars let's
go<00:01:12.119> ahead<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> add<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.560> roof<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.939> right-click

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
go ahead and add a roof so right-click

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.580 
go ahead and add a roof so right-click
your<00:01:15.479> cube<00:01:16.080> brush<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.119> change<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> X<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.810> 768

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
your cube brush and change the X to 768

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
your cube brush and change the X to 768
and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.250> white<00:01:20.549> 640<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> blog<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.320> as

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and the white 640 now I blog this out as

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.260 
and the white 640 now I blog this out as
being<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> square<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.460> exact<00:01:23.880> will<00:01:24.060> not<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
being the square that exact will not the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
being the square that exact will not the
square<00:01:24.570> being<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> rectangle<00:01:25.890> technically

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
square being the rectangle technically

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.819 
square being the rectangle technically
speaking<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> fits<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> top<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.320> our<00:01:28.560> house

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
speaking that fits the top of our house

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.569 
speaking that fits the top of our house
and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.820> 64<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.540> our<00:01:30.600> classic<00:01:30.960> width<00:01:31.579> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and then 64 for our classic width so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
and then 64 for our classic width so
just<00:01:33.180> build<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> see

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
just build this and make sure we can see

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.130 
just build this and make sure we can see
our<00:01:34.290> builder<00:01:34.530> brush<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.960> let's<00:01:36.960> just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
our builder brush and let's just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
our builder brush and let's just
position<00:01:37.500> listen<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> place<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
position listen to place just going to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.510 
position listen to place just going to
sit<00:01:42.150> above<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> house<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
sit above the house like that and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.260 
sit above the house like that and
perfectly<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> top<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> that's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
perfectly on top like that so that's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.109 
perfectly on top like that so that's
looking<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.659> clean<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> views

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
looking pretty clean from all the views

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
looking pretty clean from all the views
let's<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.299> ahead<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> CSG<00:01:52.350> add<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
let's go ahead and CSG add this and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.359 
let's go ahead and CSG add this and
close<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:53.909> builder<00:01:54.570> brush<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.619> some<00:01:56.130> houses

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
close our builder brush so some houses

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.490 
close our builder brush so some houses
have<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> flat<00:01:56.939> roof<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.899> might<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.290> your

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
have a flat roof and you might want your

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
have a flat roof and you might want your
house<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.520> scene<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> flat<00:02:00.299> roof

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
house in this scene to have a flat roof

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
house in this scene to have a flat roof
but<00:02:01.079> personally<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> pointy<00:02:02.430> roofs<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
but personally I like pointy roofs so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.880 
but personally I like pointy roofs so
what<00:02:03.659> we're<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.439> we're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
what we're going to do is we're going to
go<00:02:05.040> into<00:02:05.189> geometry<00:02:05.759> mode<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.110> just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
go into geometry mode so that's just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.550 
go into geometry mode so that's just
select<00:02:08.099> our<00:02:08.190> object<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.319> let's<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.349> click

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
select our object and let's just click

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.979 
select our object and let's just click
geometry<00:02:10.979> mode<00:02:11.390> okay<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.450> immediately<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
geometry mode okay so immediately you

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.700 
geometry mode okay so immediately you
can<00:02:13.080> see

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
can see

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.000 
can see
we<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.070> all<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.430> vertex<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> an<00:02:16.290> edge

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
we have all these vertex and an edge

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.240 
we have all these vertex and an edge
options<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.180> what<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.380> we

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
options so what we can actually do is we

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 
options so what we can actually do is we
can<00:02:20.430> pretty<00:02:20.640> much<00:02:20.730> edit<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.420> whole<00:02:22.020> lot<00:02:22.260> of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
can pretty much edit a whole lot of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.310 
can pretty much edit a whole lot of
things<00:02:22.560> about<00:02:23.010> our<00:02:23.370> mesh<00:02:23.820> your<00:02:24.030> brush<00:02:24.330> using

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
things about our mesh your brush using

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.740 
things about our mesh your brush using
the<00:02:25.620> geometry<00:02:26.070> tools<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.240> what<00:02:27.630> we're

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the geometry tools so what we're

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.240 
the geometry tools so what we're
actually<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:29.070> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
actually going to do for this one is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.130 
actually going to do for this one is
we're<00:02:29.910> going<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.150> split<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.630> half<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.080> way

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
we're going to split it in half this way

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
we're going to split it in half this way
and<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:32.340> we're<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.490> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.820> raise<00:02:33.150> those

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
and then we're just going to raise those

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540 
and then we're just going to raise those
vertexes<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:35.070> should<00:02:35.310> make<00:02:35.490> a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
vertexes up and that should make a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.240 
vertexes up and that should make a
pointy<00:02:35.880> roof<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> split<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.710> half<00:02:37.890> or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
pointy roof so to split and a half or

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.010 
pointy roof so to split and a half or
actually<00:02:38.700> wanting<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.300> basically<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
actually wanting to do basically is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.890 
actually wanting to do basically is
split<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.250> edge<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.760> half<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.570> edge<00:02:42.750> in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
split this edge in half and this edge in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
split this edge in half and this edge in
half<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:43.920> select<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.460> one<00:02:44.520> or

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
half so if we just select this one or

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.640 
half so if we just select this one or
the<00:02:44.880> other<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.150> OOP<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.200> quick<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the other one OOP something quick at the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.640 
the other one OOP something quick at the
edge<00:02:46.740> there<00:02:47.840> okay<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.110> go<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.530> I've

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
edge there okay there we go so I've

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.340 
edge there okay there we go so I've
selected<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.870> split<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.200> in

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
selected that and if we split this in

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.900 
selected that and if we split this in
half<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.800> will<00:02:52.950> split<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.310> edge<00:02:53.400> exactly<00:02:53.670> in

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
half it will split the edge exactly in

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.360 
half it will split the edge exactly in
half<00:02:53.970> hence<00:02:54.510> splitting<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.470> whole<00:02:55.680> brush<00:02:56.040> in

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
half hence splitting the whole brush in

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
half hence splitting the whole brush in
half<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> let's<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.710> click<00:02:58.860> split<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.610> well

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
half so let's just click split and well

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.490 
half so let's just click split and well
would<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> look<00:03:00.780> at<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:00.960> it's<00:03:01.230> split

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
would you look at that it's split

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.120 
would you look at that it's split
perfectly<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:01.980> half<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.690> now<00:03:04.590> let's<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.010> ahead

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
perfectly in half so now let's go ahead

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.920 
perfectly in half so now let's go ahead
and<00:03:05.250> go<00:03:05.520> into<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:06.870> we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and go into this for you because what we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.510 
and go into this for you because what we
actually<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> move

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
actually want to be is going to move

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.800 
actually want to be is going to move
this<00:03:08.850> vertex<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:10.080> vertex<00:03:10.560> up<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.720> can

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
this vertex and this vertex up so we can

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.150 
this vertex and this vertex up so we can
do<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:12.990> really<00:03:13.170> easily<00:03:13.410> by<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.680> clicking

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
do this really easily by just clicking

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.180 
do this really easily by just clicking
here<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.780> viewport<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.890> measure

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
here in this viewport now you measure

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.950 
here in this viewport now you measure
this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.490> selected<00:03:17.760> both<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
this is selected both now this is

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.290 
this is selected both now this is
because<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.560> from<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.920> viewport<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.820> click<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
because it from the viewport we click it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.850 
because it from the viewport we click it
and<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.570> program<00:03:21.900> goes<00:03:22.080> oh<00:03:22.230> my<00:03:22.530> god<00:03:22.680> what<00:03:22.800> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
and the program goes oh my god what the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.470 
and the program goes oh my god what the
hell<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.160> i<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.850> i<00:03:23.910> select<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.270> one<00:03:24.360> at<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
hell do i do so i select the one at the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.260 
hell do i do so i select the one at the
front<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.140> back<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:26.370> do<00:03:26.490> i<00:03:26.520> do<00:03:26.640> what<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.240> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
front or the back what do i do what do I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.850 
front or the back what do i do what do I
dick<00:03:27.510> well<00:03:27.990> no<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.290> doesn't<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.680> tool

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
dick well no it doesn't do that tool

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.410 
dick well no it doesn't do that tool
that's<00:03:29.160> complete<00:03:29.490> lie<00:03:29.610> what<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> does<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.390> it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that's complete lie what it does is it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.970 
that's complete lie what it does is it
goes<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.020> know<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.320> I'm<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.860> select

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
goes you know what I'm going to select

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.330 
goes you know what I'm going to select
both<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.720> selected<00:03:34.170> both<00:03:34.380> vertexes<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
both so it's selected both vertexes and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.130 
both so it's selected both vertexes and
now<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.060> just<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.330> ahead<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.570> translate

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
now we can just go ahead and translate

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.500 
now we can just go ahead and translate
these<00:03:37.260> upwards<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.670> make<00:03:38.820> as<00:03:38.970> much<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.390> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
these upwards and just make as much of a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.040 
these upwards and just make as much of a
a<00:03:39.930> point<00:03:40.740> as<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.630> okay<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:42.690> when<00:03:42.960> you've

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
a point as you like okay so when you've

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.930 
a point as you like okay so when you've
done<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.470> go<00:03:43.650> ahead<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:43.950> rebuild<00:03:44.730> your

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
done that just go ahead and rebuild your

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.920 
done that just go ahead and rebuild your
geometry<00:03:46.790> okay<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:47.850> that's<00:03:48.090> geometry<00:03:48.540> mode<00:03:48.720> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
geometry okay so that's geometry mode is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050 
geometry okay so that's geometry mode is
very<00:03:49.620> simple<00:03:49.830> basically<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.640> can<00:03:50.850> just

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
very simple basically you can just

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.980 
very simple basically you can just
modify<00:03:51.320> your<00:03:52.320> edges<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.190> vertexes<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.210> your

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
modify your edges and vertexes of your

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.880 
modify your edges and vertexes of your
messages<00:03:55.470> or<00:03:55.620> brushes<00:03:56.960> so<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.770> all

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
messages or brushes so this is all

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.350 
messages or brushes so this is all
looking<00:03:59.160> ok<00:03:59.430> let's<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.880> go<00:03:59.970> ahead<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.180> make

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
looking ok let's just go ahead and make

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.430 
looking ok let's just go ahead and make
sure<00:04:00.480> our<00:04:00.510> Lighting's<00:04:01.020> are<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.260> that's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
sure our Lighting's are right that's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.010 
sure our Lighting's are right that's
good<00:04:01.560> tool<00:04:01.710> it<00:04:01.890> ok<00:04:02.880> I'll<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:03.330> it's<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.570> bit

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
good tool it ok I'll I think it's a bit

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.380 
good tool it ok I'll I think it's a bit
dodgy<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.710> say<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.040> least<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:06.090> it's<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.360> little

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
dodgy to say the least so it's a little

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.990 
dodgy to say the least so it's a little
right<00:04:06.750> inside<00:04:07.140> our<00:04:07.350> house<00:04:07.530> yeah<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.520> position

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
right inside our house yeah I position

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.540 
right inside our house yeah I position
the<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.270> quite<00:04:09.570> well<00:04:09.720> last<00:04:09.990> time<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:11.280> that's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
the like quite well last time so that's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.180 
the like quite well last time so that's
okay<00:04:12.050> pillars<00:04:13.050> lighting<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.590> bit<00:04:13.740> dodgy<00:04:13.920> I

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
okay pillars lighting is a bit dodgy I

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.680 
okay pillars lighting is a bit dodgy I
think<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.790> may<00:04:14.910> need<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.120> create<00:04:15.390> another<00:04:15.930> light

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
think I may need to create another light

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.479 
think I may need to create another light
so<00:04:18.690> let's<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.080> lift<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.830> bit<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.190> kind

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
so let's just lift this up a bit I kind

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.610 
so let's just lift this up a bit I kind
of<00:04:20.549> want<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.150> see<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.570> all<00:04:22.169> right<00:04:22.320> I've<00:04:22.500> an

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
of want to see the all right I've an

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.330 
of want to see the all right I've an
idea<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:23.220> can<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.550> our<00:04:23.580> kind<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> skylight

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
idea this can be our kind of skylight

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.850 
idea this can be our kind of skylight
that<00:04:26.340> likes<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
that likes the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.369 
that likes the
the<00:04:28.250> whole<00:04:28.430> area<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.900> guess<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.139> should

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379 
the whole area and I guess I should

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:34.540 
the whole area and I guess I should
really<00:04:33.560> go<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.800> more<00:04:33.979> central<00:04:34.400> if<00:04:34.490> it's

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
really go that more central if it's

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.749 
really go that more central if it's
going<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.759> be<00:04:34.909> that<00:04:35.469> okay<00:04:36.469> maybe<00:04:36.620> I'll<00:04:36.770> change

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.300 

your<00:04:40.759> mind<00:04:41.650> let's<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:42.710> scale<00:04:43.039> them<00:04:43.189> off<00:04:43.280> a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
your mind let's just scale them off a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.640 
your mind let's just scale them off a
bit<00:04:43.580> oh<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:47.030> see<00:04:47.650> yeah<00:04:48.650> ok<00:04:49.189> so<00:04:50.060> let's<00:04:50.629> in<00:04:51.439> fight

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
bit oh I see yeah ok so let's in fight

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.159 
bit oh I see yeah ok so let's in fight
yeah<00:04:51.889> let's<00:04:52.310> put<00:04:52.490> this<00:04:52.580> back<00:04:52.789> here<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.530> then

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
yeah let's put this back here and then

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.429 
yeah let's put this back here and then
let's<00:04:57.169> also<00:04:57.409> use<00:04:57.740> our<00:04:57.889> alts<00:04:58.219> trick<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.990> make<00:05:00.229> a

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
let's also use our alts trick to make a

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.480 
let's also use our alts trick to make a
clone<00:05:01.599> over<00:05:02.599> here<00:05:03.069> which<00:05:04.069> we're<00:05:04.279> going<00:05:04.430> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
clone over here which we're going to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.990 
clone over here which we're going to
scale<00:05:04.669> down<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.909> bit<00:05:06.490> because<00:05:07.490> there's<00:05:07.729> too

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
scale down a bit because there's too

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.899 
scale down a bit because there's too
much<00:05:08.150> lighting<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:08.629> feel<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.400> let's<00:05:10.759> just

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
much lighting I feel so let's just

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.670 
much lighting I feel so let's just
translate<00:05:11.360> him<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.509> lot<00:05:11.719> more<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:14.560> won't<00:05:15.560> work

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
translate him a lot more I won't work

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.429 
translate him a lot more I won't work
when<00:05:15.800> we're<00:05:15.919> trying<00:05:16.069> to<00:05:16.250> do<00:05:16.430> here<00:05:17.289> kind<00:05:18.289> of

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439 
when we're trying to do here kind of

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.950 
when we're trying to do here kind of
want<00:05:18.620> it<00:05:18.650> ok<00:05:19.639> fine<00:05:19.879> i<00:05:19.909> but<00:05:20.180> i'll<00:05:20.330> have<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.599> there

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
want it ok fine i but i'll have it there

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.439 
want it ok fine i but i'll have it there
perhaps<00:05:21.800> oh<00:05:24.909> yeah<00:05:25.909> it's<00:05:26.090> move<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.300> down<00:05:26.419> a

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
perhaps oh yeah it's move it down a

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.230 
perhaps oh yeah it's move it down a
little<00:05:26.659> bit<00:05:30.219> ok<00:05:31.219> that's<00:05:31.250> generally<00:05:31.940> looking<00:05:32.120> a

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
little bit ok that's generally looking a

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.629 
little bit ok that's generally looking a
war<00:05:32.479> war<00:05:32.629> war<00:05:32.659> what's<00:05:32.960> happening<00:05:33.349> here<00:05:33.639> all

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
war war war what's happening here all

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.369 
war war war what's happening here all
right<00:05:35.029> let's<00:05:35.330> let's<00:05:35.779> move<00:05:35.960> this<00:05:36.110> a<00:05:36.169> little

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
right let's let's move this a little

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:43.029 
right let's let's move this a little
more<00:05:39.339> ok<00:05:40.339> anymore<00:05:41.469> if<00:05:42.469> I<00:05:42.589> let's<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:42.889> put<00:05:43.009> it

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
more ok anymore if I let's just put it

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.920 
more ok anymore if I let's just put it
right<00:05:43.129> on<00:05:43.339> the<00:05:43.400> corner<00:05:43.729> that<00:05:44.389> could<00:05:44.539> work<00:05:44.659> outs

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
right on the corner that could work outs

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.640 
right on the corner that could work outs
like<00:05:45.259> they're<00:05:47.020> ok<00:05:48.020> we're<00:05:48.199> still<00:05:48.289> having<00:05:48.620> some

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
like they're ok we're still having some

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.379 
like they're ok we're still having some
dark<00:05:49.039> issues<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:49.759> let's<00:05:49.940> just<00:05:50.120> go<00:05:50.210> ahead<00:05:50.240> and

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
dark issues so let's just go ahead and

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:58.689 
dark issues so let's just go ahead and
scale<00:05:50.629> this<00:05:50.750> up<00:05:56.740> ok<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.889> think<00:05:57.949> generally<00:05:58.550> looks

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
scale this up ok I think generally looks

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.029 
scale this up ok I think generally looks
pretty<00:05:58.969> good<00:05:59.469> again<00:06:00.469> we're<00:06:00.680> having<00:06:00.889> some

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
pretty good again we're having some

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.709 
pretty good again we're having some
lighting<00:06:01.219> issues<00:06:01.550> with<00:06:01.699> this<00:06:01.879> side<00:06:02.180> perhaps

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
lighting issues with this side perhaps

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:03.760 
lighting issues with this side perhaps
you<00:06:02.839> should<00:06:02.870> put<00:06:03.110> another<00:06:03.319> right<00:06:03.500> in<00:06:03.620> there

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
you should put another right in there

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.559 
you should put another right in there
but<00:06:04.039> I'm<00:06:04.250> not<00:06:04.699> too<00:06:04.849> bothered<00:06:05.000> about<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.449> for

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
but I'm not too bothered about that for

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.779 
but I'm not too bothered about that for
now<00:06:05.719> so<00:06:06.469> let's<00:06:06.889> go<00:06:07.009> ahead<00:06:07.039> and<00:06:07.219> try<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.490> play

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
now so let's go ahead and try and play

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.240 
now so let's go ahead and try and play
this<00:06:08.000> so<00:06:08.990> once<00:06:09.529> again<00:06:09.650> I'm<00:06:09.979> just<00:06:10.039> going<00:06:10.129> to

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
this so once again I'm just going to

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.279 
this so once again I'm just going to
click<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:11.060> build<00:06:11.330> little<00:06:11.629> button<00:06:11.900> and<00:06:12.110> I'll

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
click the build little button and I'll

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.839 
click the build little button and I'll
tell<00:06:12.529> you<00:06:12.589> when<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:12.889> done<00:06:15.370> okay<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:16.430> we'll

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
tell you when it's done okay so we'll

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.129 
tell you when it's done okay so we'll
just<00:06:16.879> build<00:06:17.150> everything<00:06:17.389> let's<00:06:17.750> go<00:06:17.900> ahead<00:06:18.020> and

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
just build everything let's go ahead and

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.730 
just build everything let's go ahead and
try<00:06:18.349> and<00:06:18.439> play<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.860> level<00:06:19.300> play<00:06:20.300> from<00:06:20.479> here

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
try and play the level play from here

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.820 
try and play the level play from here
and<00:06:22.449> here<00:06:23.449> we<00:06:23.599> are<00:06:23.750> we<00:06:23.990> have<00:06:24.110> a<00:06:24.139> roof<00:06:24.379> above<00:06:24.620> our

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
and here we are we have a roof above our

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.850 
and here we are we have a roof above our
heads<00:06:25.129> and<00:06:25.400> we<00:06:26.360> have<00:06:26.479> our<00:06:26.629> windows<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.409> our

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
heads and we have our windows and our

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.249 
heads and we have our windows and our
door<00:06:28.069> just<00:06:28.339> as<00:06:28.699> usual<00:06:29.000> look<00:06:29.449> outside<00:06:29.659> we<00:06:30.110> have

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
door just as usual look outside we have

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.499 
door just as usual look outside we have
our<00:06:30.409> pillars<00:06:30.889> which<00:06:31.729> could<00:06:31.969> possibly<00:06:32.089> be<00:06:32.479> a

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
our pillars which could possibly be a

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:33.820 
our pillars which could possibly be a
little<00:06:32.659> bit<00:06:32.779> taller<00:06:32.810> really<00:06:33.409> i<00:06:33.439> just<00:06:33.529> made

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
little bit taller really i just made

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.279 
little bit taller really i just made
them<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:34.009> same<00:06:34.189> height<00:06:34.460> as<00:06:34.669> the<00:06:34.899> house<00:06:35.899> of

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
them the same height as the house of

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.610 
them the same height as the house of
uppers<00:06:37.039> and<00:06:37.310> then<00:06:37.610> try<00:06:38.449> a<00:06:38.479> good<00:06:38.719> view<00:06:38.870> of<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.080> we

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
uppers and then try a good view of it we

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.640 
uppers and then try a good view of it we
have<00:06:39.830> our

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
have our

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.379 
have our
plenty<00:06:41.370> roof<00:06:41.639> like<00:06:42.389> that<00:06:43.220> so<00:06:44.220> the<00:06:45.180> only

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
plenty roof like that so the only

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.120 
plenty roof like that so the only
problem<00:06:45.630> with<00:06:45.900> this<00:06:46.050> at<00:06:46.350> the<00:06:46.620> moment<00:06:47.009> is

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
problem with this at the moment is

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.999 
problem with this at the moment is
possibly<00:06:47.550> a<00:06:47.669> few<00:06:47.820> lighting<00:06:48.210> issues<00:06:48.540> and

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
possibly a few lighting issues and

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.050 
possibly a few lighting issues and
possibly<00:06:50.009> also<00:06:50.190> a<00:06:50.280> few<00:06:50.400> challenger<00:06:50.850> issues

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
possibly also a few challenger issues

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.930 
possibly also a few challenger issues
but<00:06:51.960> excluding<00:06:52.650> those<00:06:52.770> everything<00:06:53.610> is<00:06:53.759> with

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
but excluding those everything is with

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.350 
but excluding those everything is with
this<00:06:54.120> purple<00:06:54.990> and<00:06:55.199> kind<00:06:55.530> of<00:06:55.590> grayish

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
this purple and kind of grayish

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.550 
this purple and kind of grayish
checkerboard<00:06:57.360> so<00:06:57.750> in<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:57.930> next<00:06:58.080> lesson<00:06:58.350> what

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
checkerboard so in the next lesson what

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.930 
checkerboard so in the next lesson what
we're<00:06:58.680> going<00:06:58.770> to<00:06:58.860> learn<00:06:58.919> how<00:06:58.979> to<00:06:59.100> do<00:06:59.280> is<00:06:59.460> we're

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
we're going to learn how to do is we're

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.150 
we're going to learn how to do is we're
going<00:07:00.030> to<00:07:00.240> learn<00:07:00.419> how<00:07:00.479> to<00:07:00.720> put<00:07:01.139> materials<00:07:01.860> onto

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
going to learn how to put materials onto

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.330 
going to learn how to put materials onto
your<00:07:02.940> pieces<00:07:03.479> of<00:07:03.630> geometry<00:07:04.039> but<00:07:05.039> for<00:07:05.250> now

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
your pieces of geometry but for now

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.550 
your pieces of geometry but for now
that's<00:07:05.550> pretty<00:07:06.180> much<00:07:06.300> the<00:07:06.360> end<00:07:06.539> of<00:07:06.780> ODI<00:07:07.259> fool

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
that's pretty much the end of ODI fool

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.010 
that's pretty much the end of ODI fool
enough<00:07:07.620> that's<00:07:08.430> pretty<00:07:08.699> much<00:07:08.820> the<00:07:08.970> end<00:07:09.150> of<00:07:09.509> the

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
enough that's pretty much the end of the

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.409 
enough that's pretty much the end of the
geometry<00:07:10.530> section<00:07:10.860> of<00:07:10.979> our<00:07:11.130> house<00:07:11.610> area<00:07:12.210> and

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
geometry section of our house area and

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.330 
geometry section of our house area and
that's<00:07:13.139> the<00:07:13.229> end<00:07:13.289> of<00:07:13.350> this<00:07:13.440> lesson<00:07:13.650> have<00:07:14.310> a

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
that's the end of this lesson have a

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.699 
that's the end of this lesson have a
nice<00:07:14.520> day
