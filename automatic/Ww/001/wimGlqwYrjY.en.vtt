00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
subject you should know that chords and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
subject you should know that chords and
scales<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.680> intimately<00:00:38.309> linked<00:00:39.180> if

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scales are really intimately linked if

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
scales are really intimately linked if
you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> chord<00:00:40.170> progression<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you have a chord progression that is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
you have a chord progression that is
written<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> same<00:00:41.700> key<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.480> scale<00:00:42.870> from

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
written in the same key one scale from

written in the same key one scale from
which<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> extract<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:45.300> notes

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
which you're going to extract some notes

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
which you're going to extract some notes
and<00:00:45.870> build<00:00:46.230> some<00:00:46.440> chords<00:00:46.860> put<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.250> chords

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and build some chords put these chords

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
and build some chords put these chords
together<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:48.270> chords<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.050> linked

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
together these chords are linked

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
together these chords are linked
together<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.610> they're<00:00:50.940> extracted<00:00:51.629> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
together because they're extracted from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
together because they're extracted from
a<00:00:52.170> scale<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.070> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> talk<00:00:53.640> about

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a scale first we're going to talk about

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
a scale first we're going to talk about
chord<00:00:54.239> progressions<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.140> built<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
chord progressions that are built on the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
chord progressions that are built on the
same<00:00:56.039> key<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.579> playing<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.030> guitar<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
same key you're playing your guitar you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
same key you're playing your guitar you
found<00:00:58.379> four<00:00:58.739> chords<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> work<00:00:59.520> fairly<00:00:59.820> well

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
found four chords that work fairly well

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.240 
found four chords that work fairly well
together<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.930> love<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> play

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
together you love them you want to play

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
together you love them you want to play
a<00:01:02.280> solo<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:03.780> skill<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> use

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
a solo you don't know which skill to use

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
a solo you don't know which skill to use
in<00:01:04.890> order<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> find<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> scale<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.820> really

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in order to find the scale it's really

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
in order to find the scale it's really
simple<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.750> simply<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> print<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
simple we're simply going to print out a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.730 
simple we're simply going to print out a
blank<00:01:08.670> guitar<00:01:09.240> fretboard<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.530> guitar

don't fill in the blank it doesn't
matter<00:01:45.180> we'll<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.200> with

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
matter we'll then do the same thing with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
matter we'll then do the same thing with
two<00:01:46.799> other<00:01:47.009> chords<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> our<00:01:47.610> chord

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
two other chords of our chord

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149 
two other chords of our chord
progression<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.380> minor<00:01:49.829> so

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
progression here it is with a minor so

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.410 
progression here it is with a minor so
we're<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> fill<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> blanks<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
we're going to fill in the blanks so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
we're going to fill in the blanks so
that<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> minor<00:01:52.259> fits<00:01:52.710> our<00:01:53.040> blank<00:01:53.369> fretboard

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that a minor fits our blank fretboard

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
that a minor fits our blank fretboard
and<00:01:54.060> we'll<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.960> same<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and we'll now do the same thing with the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
and we'll now do the same thing with the
C<00:01:55.950> major<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> add<00:01:56.820> our<00:01:57.030> C<00:01:57.210> major

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
C major we're going to add our C major

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
C major we're going to add our C major
to<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.229> fretboard<00:01:58.829> four<00:01:59.369> chords<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.210> are

are part of our scale we're now going to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.900 
are part of our scale we're now going to
reorganize<00:02:51.170> these<00:02:51.830> notes<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.280> alphabetical

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
reorganize these notes in alphabetical

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.530 
reorganize these notes in alphabetical
order<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.080> first<00:02:54.380> note<00:02:55.540> corresponds

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
order so that the first note corresponds

to<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.900> root<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.410> our<00:02:57.650> first<00:02:57.950> chord<00:02:58.370> which<00:02:58.940> in

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
to the root of our first chord which in

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.660 
to the root of our first chord which in
this<00:02:59.210> case<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.690> G<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.340> what<00:03:01.490> we'll

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
this case is G so this is what we'll

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.430 
this case is G so this is what we'll
have<00:03:01.780> we'll<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:02.990> scale<00:03:03.440> made<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.980> g<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.430> b

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
have we'll have a scale made of a g a b

which type of accidental to use it all

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.150 
which type of accidental to use it all
comes<00:03:25.760> down<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:25.970> this<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.540> less<00:03:27.440> notes<00:03:27.980> you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
comes down to this the less notes you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.370 
comes down to this the less notes you
have<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.550> your<00:03:28.670> chord<00:03:28.970> progression<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.170> more

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
have in your chord progression the more

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.590 
have in your chord progression the more

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
options you have as far as scales and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.510 
options you have as far as scales and
that's<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.140> that's<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.590> scale<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.340> is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
that's it that's the scale that is

extracted from the chords that you have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.650 
extracted from the chords that you have
if<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.370> play<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.730> notes<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.209> are<00:03:38.330> found<00:03:38.600> on

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660

if you play the notes that are found on
that<00:03:38.720> shape<00:03:39.110> your<00:03:39.739> solo<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.520> going<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.790> work

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
that shape your solo is going to work

that shape your solo is going to work
really<00:03:41.540> well<00:03:41.660> as<00:03:42.020> I<00:03:42.230> said<00:03:42.290> earlier<00:03:42.830> some<00:03:43.160> chord

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
really well as I said earlier some chord

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920 
really well as I said earlier some chord
progressions<00:03:43.940> are<00:03:44.120> going<00:03:44.270> to<00:03:44.360> use<00:03:44.600> more<00:03:44.870> than

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
progressions are going to use more than

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.500 
progressions are going to use more than
one<00:03:45.140> scale<00:03:45.770> if<00:03:46.010> when<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.489> write<00:03:46.700> down<00:03:46.730> all<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
one scale if when you write down all the

notes<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.959> your<00:03:48.110> chords<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.739> find<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.070> you

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
notes of your chords you find that you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.979 
notes of your chords you find that you
have<00:03:49.310> more<00:03:49.550> than<00:03:49.760> seven<00:03:50.270> notes<00:03:50.540> you're

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
have more than seven notes you're

have more than seven notes you're
dealing<00:03:51.320> with<00:03:51.350> two<00:03:51.620> different<00:03:51.950> scales<00:03:52.190> you'll

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
dealing with two different scales you'll

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.220 
dealing with two different scales you'll
find<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.180> some<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.570> notes<00:03:53.780> share

find that some of the notes share
different<00:03:54.440> accidentals<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.489> might<00:03:55.640> have<00:03:55.850> an

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
different accidentals you might have an

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.770 
different accidentals you might have an
A<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.420> an<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.989> sharp<00:03:57.230> maybe<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:58.160> G<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:59.330> G<00:03:59.510> sharp

A in an a sharp maybe a G and a G sharp

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.360 
A in an a sharp maybe a G and a G sharp
there's<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.170> lot<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.560> different<00:04:00.800> possibilities

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
there's a lot of different possibilities

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.510 
there's a lot of different possibilities
one<00:04:01.640> set<00:04:02.000> with<00:04:02.540> one<00:04:03.320> type<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.590> accidental<00:04:04.340> and

one set with one type of accidental and

the other with the other type of

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.870 
the other with the other type of
accidental<00:04:06.709> so<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.010> might<00:04:07.250> have<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> scale

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
accidental so you might have a scale

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.000 
accidental so you might have a scale
with<00:04:08.239> g<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.170> b<00:04:09.739> c<00:04:10.190> d<00:04:10.610> e<00:04:11.090> f<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.380> second<00:04:12.769> scale

with G a B C sharp d e f it's just like

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
which scale matches which chord and you

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.890 
which scale matches which chord and you
know<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.520> they're<00:04:22.669> intimately<00:04:23.150> linked<00:04:23.660> food
