00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
decorators icing in it it'll look like

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.399 
decorators icing in it it'll look like
it's<00:06:36.349> broken<00:06:36.710> down<00:06:36.889> a<00:06:37.069> little<00:06:37.399> bit<00:06:37.639> but<00:06:37.879> that's

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
it's broken down a little bit but that's

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.860
