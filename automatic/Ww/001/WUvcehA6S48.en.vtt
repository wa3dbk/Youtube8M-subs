00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
shape the base is a little bit rounded

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
shape the base is a little bit rounded
so<00:00:25.560> he<00:00:25.679> doesn't<00:00:26.039> sit<00:00:26.429> so<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:30.019> comfortably<00:00:31.019> on

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
so he doesn't sit so so comfortably on
the<00:00:31.380> base<00:00:31.560> he<00:00:31.769> kind<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.160> wobbles<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> little<00:00:32.759> bit

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090

but<00:00:33.900> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.740> Aquos<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:36.440> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.590> look<00:00:37.770> at

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
but this one is Aquos and if you look at

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.170 
but this one is Aquos and if you look at
the<00:00:37.980> different<00:00:38.280> sides<00:00:38.490> you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the different sides you can see the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.410 
the different sides you can see the
attribute<00:00:39.630> side<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:41.880> next<00:00:42.210> side

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
attribute side here first the next side

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.610 
attribute side here first the next side
has<00:00:44.720> actually<00:00:45.720> all<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.990> sides<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.440> these

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
has actually all the sides have these

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560 
has actually all the sides have these
markings<00:00:47.040> on<00:00:47.310> them<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.880> looks<00:00:48.390> like

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
markings on them but it looks like

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.860 
markings on them but it looks like
crowns<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.030> thought<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.450> one<00:00:51.720> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
crowns and then I thought this one in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.890 
crowns and then I thought this one in
the<00:00:51.990> middle<00:00:52.190> like<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.870> like<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
the middle like kind of like like a

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.370 
the middle like kind of like like a
pastry<00:00:55.410> chefs<00:00:55.800> hat<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:58.560> on<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.760> back<00:01:00.000> side

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
pastry chefs hat and on this back side

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.249 
pastry chefs hat and on this back side
there's<00:01:01.380> some<00:01:01.980> sort<00:01:02.970> of<00:01:03.150> mysterious<00:01:03.840> hole<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
there's some sort of mysterious hole in

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.920 
there's some sort of mysterious hole in
the<00:01:04.739> middle<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> still<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the middle but then you still have the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250 
the middle but then you still have the
other<00:01:07.619> markings<00:01:08.160> to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.150> crowns<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
other markings to the the crowns and the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
other markings to the the crowns and the
triangle<00:01:10.860> triangular<00:01:11.670> type<00:01:11.910> formations<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
triangle triangular type formations the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.310 
triangle triangular type formations the
bottom<00:01:15.690> side<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.300> where<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.330> magnet

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
bottom side where the where the magnet

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.070 
bottom side where the where the magnet
is<00:01:19.640> there's<00:01:21.080> similar<00:01:22.080> markings<00:01:22.500> crowns<00:01:24.080> again

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is there's similar markings crowns again

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.110 
is there's similar markings crowns again
in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.710> triangle<00:01:26.159> formations<00:01:27.440> so<00:01:28.440> this<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
in the triangle formations so this is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.930 
in the triangle formations so this is
tripod<00:01:30.120> Epsilon<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.870> it's<00:01:31.170> closed<00:01:31.590> form<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
tripod Epsilon and it's closed form and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.010 
tripod Epsilon and it's closed form and
next<00:01:33.510> I'll<00:01:33.630> show<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.080> it's<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:36.020> okay

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
next I'll show it when it's open okay

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.740 
next I'll show it when it's open okay
this<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.440> tripod<00:01:38.010> Epsilon<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.120> it's<00:01:39.300> open

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this is tripod Epsilon and it's open

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.000 
this is tripod Epsilon and it's open
form<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:41.580> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.270> got<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> very

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
the outside he has the tripod shape and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.990 
the outside he has the tripod shape and
that<00:01:49.170> sort<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> continues<00:01:50.370> on<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> inside

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that sort of continues on the inside

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
that sort of continues on the inside
with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:52.530> sorry<00:01:52.770> pyramid<00:01:53.310> shape<00:01:53.549> and

triangles<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.549> slides<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.000> folded<00:01:57.420> down

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
triangles as the slides have folded down

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.570 
triangles as the slides have folded down
the<00:01:59.070> creature<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.940> middle<00:02:01.369> there's<00:02:02.369> been

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
the creature in the middle there's been

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.100 
the creature in the middle there's been
much<00:02:02.729> debate<00:02:02.970> about<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> particular

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
much debate about what that particular

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.529 
much debate about what that particular
creature<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.510> believe<00:02:06.510> he<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:06.930> frog<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
creature is I believe he is a frog and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.390 
creature is I believe he is a frog and
there's<00:02:09.750> also<00:02:09.929> been<00:02:10.259> stipulations<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
there's also been stipulations that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.280 
there's also been stipulations that
perhaps<00:02:11.819> he's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> lizard<00:02:12.569> type<00:02:13.079> creature<00:02:13.379> but

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
perhaps he's a lizard type creature but

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.440 
perhaps he's a lizard type creature but
I<00:02:14.379> think<00:02:15.010> he's<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.129> frog<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:16.269> he<00:02:16.329> makes

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I think he's a frog and I think he makes

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.509 
I think he's a frog and I think he makes
a<00:02:16.629> cute<00:02:16.930> little<00:02:17.079> frog<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:20.109> sides<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
a cute little frog on the sides that

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.140 
a cute little frog on the sides that
have<00:02:21.909> folded<00:02:22.510> down<00:02:23.189> you<00:02:24.189> can<00:02:24.400> see<00:02:24.670> different

bit<00:02:38.920> on<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.970> side<00:02:41.400> opposite<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.540> a

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
bit on this side opposite you have a

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.559 
bit on this side opposite you have a
frog<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:45.099> upside<00:02:45.519> down<00:02:45.549> right<00:02:45.760> now<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:46.420> it's

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
frog it's upside down right now but it's

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.800 
frog it's upside down right now but it's
a<00:02:46.689> frog<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:48.129> kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.489> has<00:02:48.670> like<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.879> big<00:02:49.209> happy

face<00:02:50.579> with<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.760> darkest<00:02:52.260> symbol<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:54.810> then<00:02:55.810> on

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
face with the darkest symbol and then on

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.490 
face with the darkest symbol and then on
the<00:02:56.709> opposite<00:02:57.159> side<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:59.230> have<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.959> subterra

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the opposite side you have the subterra

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.440 
the opposite side you have the subterra
symbol<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.579> frog<00:03:03.939> again<00:03:04.299> it's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
symbol and you have a frog again it's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.220 
symbol and you have a frog again it's
upside<00:03:04.870> down<00:03:05.109> it<00:03:05.439> looks<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.799> frog<00:03:06.010> face

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
upside down it looks like a frog face

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.909 
upside down it looks like a frog face
but<00:03:08.230> he's<00:03:08.500> got<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.859> big<00:03:09.189> smiley<00:03:09.790> face<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.030> too

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
but he's got a big smiley face there too

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:17.659 
but he's got a big smiley face there too
so<00:03:12.359> overall<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.530> happy<00:03:15.040> frog<00:03:15.370> he's<00:03:16.150> not

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
so overall this is a happy frog he's not

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:24.000 
so overall this is a happy frog he's not
he's<00:03:18.669> not<00:03:18.729> at<00:03:19.120> all<00:03:21.030> upset<00:03:22.030> with<00:03:22.690> his<00:03:22.959> his<00:03:23.650> lot

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
in life you can see he's even smiling

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.879 
in life you can see he's even smiling
right<00:03:26.199> here<00:03:26.669> so<00:03:27.669> as<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.120> happy<00:03:28.540> frog<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.440> think

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
right here so as a happy frog I think

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.129 
right here so as a happy frog I think
he's<00:03:30.099> quite<00:03:30.609> happy<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.180> he's<00:03:31.359> got<00:03:31.750> his<00:03:31.959> own

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
he's quite happy that he's got his own

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.740 
he's quite happy that he's got his own
little<00:03:32.440> world<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.849> he<00:03:33.909> travels<00:03:34.299> around<00:03:34.389> in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
little world that he travels around in

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.479 
little world that he travels around in
which<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.620> know<00:03:35.739> pyramid<00:03:36.250> formation<00:03:37.000> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
which is you know pyramid formation and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.930 
which is you know pyramid formation and
he's<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> trap<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.840> he<00:03:41.440> works<00:03:42.129> very<00:03:42.489> uniquely

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
he's a trap so he works very uniquely

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.059 
he's a trap so he works very uniquely
compared<00:03:43.629> to<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.530> way<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.919> other

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
compared to the way that the other

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.189 
compared to the way that the other
Bakugan<00:03:45.639> marbles<00:03:46.180> work<00:03:46.449> and<00:03:46.690> he's<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:46.959> even<00:03:47.139> a

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
Bakugan marbles work and he's not even a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.189 
Bakugan marbles work and he's not even a
marble<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.310> that's<00:03:48.579> kind<00:03:48.849> of<00:03:48.909> cool<00:03:49.150> he<00:03:49.989> does

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
marble so that's kind of cool he does

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.000 
marble so that's kind of cool he does
fit<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.790> Bakugan<00:03:52.329> case<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.139> purchased

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
fit in the Bakugan case that I purchased

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.110 
fit in the Bakugan case that I purchased
it's<00:03:54.159> actually<00:03:54.579> made<00:03:55.389> for<00:03:55.720> Bakugan<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:57.370> even

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
it's actually made for Bakugan so even

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.599 
it's actually made for Bakugan so even
though<00:03:58.269> he<00:03:58.479> has<00:03:58.659> a<00:03:58.689> unique<00:03:59.139> shape<00:03:59.370> he<00:04:00.370> still

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
though he has a unique shape he still

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.330 
though he has a unique shape he still
fits<00:04:00.909> in<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> case<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.889> other<00:04:03.069> marbles

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
fits in the case like the other marbles

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.000 
fits in the case like the other marbles
do<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.930> thought<00:04:05.109> I'd<00:04:05.290> give<00:04:05.439> you<00:04:05.560> kind<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.859> a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
do and I thought I'd give you kind of a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.559 
do and I thought I'd give you kind of a
size<00:04:06.189> comparison<00:04:06.400> because<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.150> can't<00:04:07.359> really

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
size comparison because you can't really

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.800 
size comparison because you can't really
tell<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.439> right<00:04:08.859> here<00:04:09.370> maybe<00:04:10.120> how<00:04:10.419> big<00:04:10.659> he<00:04:10.780> is

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
tell like right here maybe how big he is

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.140 
tell like right here maybe how big he is
he<00:04:11.169> looks<00:04:11.620> just<00:04:11.739> massive<00:04:12.459> but

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
he looks just massive but

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.960 
he looks just massive but
I'll<00:04:14.269> kind<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.690> show<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.959> here<00:04:15.500> with<00:04:15.830> you<00:04:16.790> know

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
I'll kind of show you here with you know

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.840 
I'll kind of show you here with you know
their<00:04:17.120> Bakugan<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.680> hammer<00:04:19.070> Gorham<00:04:19.579> that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
their Bakugan this is hammer Gorham that

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.840 
their Bakugan this is hammer Gorham that
I'm<00:04:19.970> gonna<00:04:20.090> compare<00:04:20.600> his<00:04:20.780> size<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.699> can

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
I'm gonna compare his size to so you can

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.210 
I'm gonna compare his size to so you can
see<00:04:23.199> he's<00:04:24.580> compared<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.699> hammer<00:04:25.940> Goren<00:04:27.220> he's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
see he's compared to hammer Goren he's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.020 
see he's compared to hammer Goren he's
not<00:04:28.570> unusually<00:04:29.570> he's<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:30.470> very<00:04:30.650> spread<00:04:31.400> out

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
not unusually he's just very spread out

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.850 
not unusually he's just very spread out
he<00:04:32.930> is<00:04:33.080> large<00:04:33.440> in<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.770> way<00:04:33.949> in<00:04:34.520> regard<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.860> total

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
he is large in a way in regard to total

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.939 
he is large in a way in regard to total
space<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.490> he<00:04:37.550> covers<00:04:37.940> but<00:04:38.440> he's<00:04:39.440> not<00:04:39.590> any

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
space that he covers but he's not any

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.900 
space that he covers but he's not any
taller<00:04:40.280> or<00:04:41.830> really<00:04:42.830> bigger<00:04:43.250> than<00:04:43.370> hammer

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
taller or really bigger than hammer

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.310 
taller or really bigger than hammer
borne<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:46.000> but<00:04:47.000> he's<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.270> he<00:04:47.690> seems<00:04:47.930> like<00:04:48.139> he's<00:04:48.290> a

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
borne so but he's a he seems like he's a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.690 
borne so but he's a he seems like he's a
great<00:04:48.590> trap<00:04:48.919> he<00:04:49.840> I'm<00:04:50.840> not<00:04:51.110> really<00:04:51.700> completely

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
great trap he I'm not really completely

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.490 
great trap he I'm not really completely
familiar<00:04:52.910> with<00:04:53.300> how<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.510> use<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.050> traps<00:04:54.320> just

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
familiar with how to use the traps just

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.370 
familiar with how to use the traps just
yet<00:04:54.889> I'm<00:04:55.100> still<00:04:55.370> learning<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.750> think<00:04:57.139> once

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
yet I'm still learning but I think once

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.310 
yet I'm still learning but I think once
once<00:04:57.950> I<00:04:58.130> learned<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.610> then<00:04:58.970> he<00:04:59.960> seems<00:05:00.200> like

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
once I learned that then he seems like

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.690 
once I learned that then he seems like
he<00:05:00.440> could<00:05:00.530> be<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.680> great<00:05:00.950> asset<00:05:01.160> because<00:05:01.610> he

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
he could be a great asset because he

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.270 
he could be a great asset because he
does<00:05:01.880> have<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:02.960> many<00:05:03.110> attributes<00:05:03.710> at<00:05:04.100> your

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
does have so many attributes at your

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.250 
does have so many attributes at your
disposal

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
disposal
