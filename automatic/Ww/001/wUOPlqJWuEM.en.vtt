00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.499 
that just seemed way too tight so I
didn't<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.550> anywhere<00:02:09.849> near<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.209> tight

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
didn't do it anywhere near that tight

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.900 
didn't do it anywhere near that tight
but<00:02:10.840> anyways<00:02:11.830> onto<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.610> oil<00:02:12.790> pan<00:02:14.580> okay<00:02:15.580> that's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
but anyways onto the oil pan okay that's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.559 
but anyways onto the oil pan okay that's
the<00:02:16.690> oil<00:02:16.900> pan<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.340> unfortunately<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:18.879> RTV

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
the oil pan on unfortunately I'm out RTV

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.660 
the oil pan on unfortunately I'm out RTV
so<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.530> probably<00:02:20.709> won't<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.069> putting<00:02:21.310> too<00:02:21.549> much

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
so it probably won't be putting too much

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
so it probably won't be putting too much
more<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> think<00:02:22.780> I've<00:02:22.900> got<00:02:23.049> enough

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
more on but I think I've got enough

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.880 
more on but I think I've got enough
going<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:25.319> hit<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.440> block<00:02:26.620> with

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
going here that I can hit the block with

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.350 
going here that I can hit the block with
some<00:02:27.130> primer<00:02:29.430> okay<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.940> where<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.239> at

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
some primer okay so this is where I'm at

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.089 
some primer okay so this is where I'm at
with<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.780> engine<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:33.060> end<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> day<00:02:34.360> today

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
with the engine as of end a day today

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.460 
with the engine as of end a day today
I've<00:02:36.099> actually<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:37.269> hit<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.840> any<00:02:38.019> primer

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
I've actually not hit it with any primer

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.920 
I've actually not hit it with any primer
I've<00:02:38.980> been<00:02:39.569> sandblasting<00:02:40.569> some<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
I've been sandblasting some of the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.729 
I've been sandblasting some of the
fasteners<00:02:41.470> and

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
fasteners and

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.740 
fasteners and
screwing<00:02:42.579> them<00:02:42.700> into<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.150> block<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.599> that

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
screwing them into the block so that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.380 
screwing them into the block so that
they<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.079> get<00:02:44.670> painted<00:02:45.670> with<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.849> block<00:02:46.150> when

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
they can get painted with a block when

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.910 
they can get painted with a block when
the<00:02:46.510> time<00:02:46.690> comes<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.110> actually<00:02:47.470> hit<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.769> with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the time comes to actually hit it with

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.569 
the time comes to actually hit it with
paint<00:02:48.360> I've<00:02:49.360> also<00:02:49.599> been<00:02:50.370> sandblasting<00:02:51.370> some

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
paint I've also been sandblasting some

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.280

of<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.790> brackets<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.900> painted

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
of the brackets that will be painted

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.729

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
black I'm knocking off today because

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.849 
black I'm knocking off today because
well<00:02:57.280> quite<00:02:57.579> frankly<00:02:57.609> it's<00:02:58.060> late<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.500> think
