okay<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.810> is<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.110> main<00:00:30.290> screen<00:00:31.450> actually

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
okay so this is the main screen actually

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.610 
okay so this is the main screen actually
I'm<00:00:32.990> extremely<00:00:33.650> impressed<00:00:34.490> with<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:35.030> GPS

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
I'm extremely impressed with this GPS

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.670 
I'm extremely impressed with this GPS
and<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:36.770> what<00:00:36.920> I'm<00:00:37.010> going<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.190> start<00:00:37.280> with<00:00:37.610> is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
and so what I'm going to start with is

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.960 
and so what I'm going to start with is
kind<00:00:39.680> of<00:00:39.800> what<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:39.950> would<00:00:40.070> consider<00:00:40.310> the<00:00:40.640> cons

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
kind of what I would consider the cons

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.520 
kind of what I would consider the cons
but<00:00:41.300> they're<00:00:41.450> not<00:00:41.660> they're<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:42.200> really

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
but they're not they're not really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.330 
but they're not they're not really
actually<00:00:43.540> first<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.690> all<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.710> little<00:00:46.129> bit

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
actually first of all it is a little bit

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.320 
actually first of all it is a little bit
bigger<00:00:46.750> than<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.730> course<00:00:50.000> like<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.210> e

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
bigger than the of course like the e

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.810 
bigger than the of course like the e
tracks<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.320> one<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.650> those<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.460> little<00:00:52.699> bit

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
tracks and one of those and a little bit

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.040 
tracks and one of those and a little bit
heavier<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.949> also<00:00:54.949> kind<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.520> don't<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:56.050> this

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
heavier I also kind of don't like this

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.189 
heavier I also kind of don't like this
the<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.730> carabiner<00:00:59.270> clip<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.750> comes<00:00:59.900> with

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
the the carabiner clip that comes with

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.380 
the the carabiner clip that comes with
it<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:00.590> its<00:01:00.920> standard<00:01:01.399> connection<00:01:02.210> and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
it this is its standard connection and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.100 
it this is its standard connection and
it's<00:01:03.050> just<00:01:04.270> well<00:01:05.270> it's<00:01:05.360> nice<00:01:05.570> that's<00:01:05.869> kind<00:01:06.050> of

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
it's just well it's nice that's kind of

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.499 
it's just well it's nice that's kind of
weird<00:01:06.290> having<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.860> just<00:01:07.070> kind<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.729> bouncing

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
weird having it just kind of bouncing

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.510 
weird having it just kind of bouncing
around<00:01:08.630> all<00:01:08.990> over<00:01:09.020> but<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:09.860> know<00:01:09.979> there<00:01:10.310> are

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
around all over but I know there are

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.460 
around all over but I know there are
accessories<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.540> stuff<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.899> can<00:01:11.990> get<00:01:12.110> which

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
accessories and stuff you can get which

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.380 
accessories and stuff you can get which
gives<00:01:12.800> you<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.729> know<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> little<00:01:14.060> bit<00:01:14.240> better

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
gives you you know a little bit better

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.350 
gives you you know a little bit better
of<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.690> belt<00:01:14.960> clip<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.380> everything<00:01:15.740> else<00:01:16.360> clip

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
of a belt clip and everything else clip

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.810 
of a belt clip and everything else clip
does<00:01:17.570> come<00:01:17.780> off<00:01:17.899> really<00:01:18.140> easy<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.860> does<00:01:19.190> have<00:01:19.490> a

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
does come off really easy it does have a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.139 
does come off really easy it does have a
tab<00:01:20.540> here<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:21.050> actually<00:01:21.229> locks<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.729> system

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
tab here that actually locks the system

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.450 
tab here that actually locks the system
in<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.660> don't<00:01:23.869> have<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.110> worry<00:01:24.350> about<00:01:24.470> you

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
in so you don't have to worry about you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.130 
in so you don't have to worry about you
know<00:01:25.580> something<00:01:26.030> happening<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.960> back

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
know something happening and the back

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.100 
know something happening and the back
comes<00:01:27.440> off<00:01:27.619> back<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.550> very<00:01:28.580> solid<00:01:29.300> with<00:01:30.050> a

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
comes off back is very solid with a

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.440 
comes off back is very solid with a
aluminum<00:01:30.800> clip<00:01:31.280> here<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.520> locks<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
aluminum clip here that locks it in and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.770 
aluminum clip here that locks it in and
then<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.380> course<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.830> runs<00:01:33.950> on<00:01:34.240> two<00:01:35.240> doublea's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
then of course it runs on two doublea's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.859 
then of course it runs on two doublea's
it<00:01:36.710> also<00:01:36.920> has<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:38.049> mini<00:01:39.049> SD<00:01:39.490> adapter<00:01:40.490> inside<00:01:41.299> so

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
it also has a mini SD adapter inside so

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.350 
it also has a mini SD adapter inside so
I've<00:01:42.110> got<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> 8<00:01:42.740> gig<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.760> one<00:01:43.970> right<00:01:44.180> now

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
I've got a 8 gig in this one right now

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.980 
I've got a 8 gig in this one right now
with<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.500> 8<00:01:45.680> gig<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:47.000> internal<00:01:47.420> memory<00:01:47.600> I

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.160 
with the 8 gig and the internal memory I
have<00:01:50.020> topographical<00:01:51.020> maps<00:01:51.260> for<00:01:52.070> all<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:53.170> Utah

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170

Idaho Montana Wyoming and Colorado on

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.350 
Idaho Montana Wyoming and Colorado on
this<00:01:58.880> unit<00:01:59.360> right<00:01:59.600> now<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.920> using<00:02:01.360> less

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
this unit right now and it's using less

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.810 
this unit right now and it's using less
than<00:02:02.600> 10%<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:03.200> its<00:02:03.350> memory<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.430> got<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.610> lot

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
than 10% of its memory so it's got a lot

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.680 
than 10% of its memory so it's got a lot
of<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:06.259> lot<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.890> memory<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.989> ok<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.649> thing<00:02:09.860> I

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
of a lot of memory in it ok the thing I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.090 
of a lot of memory in it ok the thing I
initially<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:11.840> been<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.170> most<00:02:12.470> impressed

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
initially have been the most impressed

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.190 
initially have been the most impressed
with<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.750> its<00:02:14.750> ability<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.790> handle<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.959> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
with is its ability to handle and to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000 
with is its ability to handle and to
hold<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.920> its<00:02:19.040> signals<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:21.170> will<00:02:21.410> from<00:02:21.769> when

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
hold on to its signals it will from when

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.030 
hold on to its signals it will from when
you<00:02:22.130> turn<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.579> if<00:02:22.880> you're<00:02:23.329> in<00:02:23.480> clear<00:02:24.049> sky<00:02:24.380> it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you turn it on if you're in clear sky it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520 
you turn it on if you're in clear sky it
will<00:02:25.280> grab<00:02:26.000> all<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.269> its<00:02:26.510> satellites<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.260> lock

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
will grab all of its satellites and lock

it's a triple axis compass so that you

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
the that you have set when you're

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.950 
the that you have set when you're
backpacking<00:04:21.400> that's<00:04:22.400> not<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:23.000> real<00:04:23.270> huge<00:04:23.660> thing

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
backpacking that's not a real huge thing

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.770 
backpacking that's not a real huge thing
but<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:24.950> can<00:04:25.280> see<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.729> if<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.030> are<00:04:26.060> using<00:04:26.390> this

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
but I can see that if you are using this

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.890 
but I can see that if you are using this
on<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.710> boat<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.760> navigate<00:04:29.180> through<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.419> harbor

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
on a boat to navigate through a harbor

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.830 
on a boat to navigate through a harbor
or<00:04:30.669> actually<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:31.729> guess<00:04:31.820> backpacking<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:32.810> a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
or actually I guess backpacking in a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.330 
or actually I guess backpacking in a
certain<00:04:33.169> place<00:04:33.289> is<00:04:33.590> where<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.890> need<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.160> walk

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340
