00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello to all welcome to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 Kathrin Blum video and I have her 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
 finally at dm 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 discovered I found a bit funny 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.330
 that the free software was available as 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 the harbors flowers in which once dm live 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.380
 in the mÃ¼llers is somehow already 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.240
 for weeks there and of course already 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.650
 decoupled but good I have them now 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 I'm glad I have two 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 things taken away and now I want 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 tells why I took the matter 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.470
 how yes how can I find her and why I 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.640
 have not left other things mdm 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 yes and I would say we catch 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190
 Just take a look and dali me first 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 I did not take much of the paint because I did 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 because even wearing and otherwise determined 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.640
 anyway someone asks again and that is 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 that the color is up there 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 10.4 rosbach ii and the name fits 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 Pretty good it's a red and I can 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.780
 Do not pretend that I am not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 already have red nail polish but it is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.420
 a special red I think it's right 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.859
 really nice it is such a rose 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 rosenrot meets really best has 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.830
 its light pink under notice is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.450
 not so blatantly threatened but quite 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.579
 elegant 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.869
 I think it's really nice and that's why 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.149
 I could not stop it in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 her class bee is my witness 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.719
 because we were on Tuesday together in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.899
 skyline plaza in Frankfurt on the way and 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.100
 there in the dm I have spotted them and yes 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.860
 We had a nice evening 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 Together that was pretty cool 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.200
 and she has me in the certain 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.189
 I did not talk so much to who 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 I should not have that much now either 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.770
 but maybe it is 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.170
 also because he was there 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.759
 So talk like to see more then 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.619
 complains to the bottle beer the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.080
 small nimble boxers no yes the others 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.429
 camp I found okay now but not so 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.630
 spectacular from the colors 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.549
 or I just have you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 already had 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.500
 Let's go to the dearest there was 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.289
 three pieces one green one something her pink 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.700
 breathed and this enjoyable 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.610
 here is the color 10 01 blue - and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.819
 came here are included 24 months 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.250
 tasted open 375 and made in 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.720
 By the way, poland in the lacquer has 275 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.390
 bought so come the mature one sees 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.109
 see the short 275 here 10 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.450
 included and open 36 months after opening 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:22.769
 and made in italy as well as that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.810
 Forgot why I only have one you 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 I 've already had a lot 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.230
 I go to many green eyeshadows 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.180
 wear similar 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.239
 that's why I pinched myself and at 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.950
 the slightly rosy duo that 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.370
 are very nice colors but it is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.290
 rather cool and that's why I have time 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.310
 but left there but where you are 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.630
 I could not pass by 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 Bundesliga games also still excuses 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.970
 I wanted, first rose pattern I finds 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.489
 really nice and the sounds are really great 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.230
 really just the hammer 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.389
 So at least one of the big ones is it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.859
 we could see again totally relaxed 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.630
 stuck I do not know I have that 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.000
 I always take those with the feeling 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.139
 loose pans because I have 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.489
 written that they have no problems 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.470
 and I think that's really bad 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 slow which just because it is at essens 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.480
 and with patrice and that annoys me completely 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 beautiful 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.120
 Well, I'm doing a spot now 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.150
 from the first sound and that reminds me so 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 from the family a patina of mac das 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 is such a top but it has one 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 golden golden friendly undertone 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.140
 or no, it has a friendly 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.430
 Subtone and 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.590
 so brownish gold over thun and patina 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.250
 but it should be a bit darker 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.080
 his 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.250
 I do not know if you are still Jewish 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.380
 flash lg of will be remembered and have there 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.490
 we yes there was here now me 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.080
 already hit a bit out 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.050
 but well I do not remember how 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.360
 hot something with raging and the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.640
 should just one to one tube to max 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.040
 its patina and up to 20 times now the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.950
 besides, because I remember the lot of it 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.750
 of course not and there you can 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.180
 actually quite well realize that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.959
 which is even a little bit lighter 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.550
 So yes, that's what it actually had 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.910
 a good color donation does not ask me 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:11.430
 why the word chip card gives place 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.260
 We color me do it again so 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.420
 who is still who has almost more gold 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.280
 and not quite as much room and sound and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140
 he is here in the grave at patrice 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.640
 is a little happier what you are 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.680
 does not save bad so find both 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.400
 Sounds are beautiful and I have the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.570
 now already two days 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.419
 worn one behind the other 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.210
 super great dz sound not too blatant 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.919
 shimmering but suffering so shimmering 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.110
 but a bit more in the direction 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.669
 Nice but I would not be as mega 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.560
 shimmering name weird 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.440
 Circumcription but who knows will know 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.910
 what I mean 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.950
 that's why it's very suitable for everyday life 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.750
 nice school for the office I'm great 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.780
 I do not have the other sound yet 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.430
 worn there must have been quite a few of the 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.680
 not in my interest because that 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.800
 is right so is copper 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.060
 reddish brown can do a great autumn 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.380
 also determines many wear looks 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.000
 Definitely great, especially the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.040
 both in combination my problem is only 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.039
 if I can handle it I'll save this 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.280
 My skin takes on my eye cancer 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.160
 every bit of orange on and off 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.630
 turn it into a red around that is 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.979
 simply not sustainable for me i do 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.510
 I am a warm guy but I am 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.310
 I say so warm again that I 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.850
 The choice is not really warm colors 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.460
 can carry 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.140
 that's why yes but the sound I think 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.729
 Gorgeous and I can do it too 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.590
 the quality in any case receiver 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.120
 are the really good color task 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.920
 no comparison in spring 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.730
 softly trios 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.020
 so what else is there to say I 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.820
 I already said why I like the others 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.280
 Lacke and you do not have exactly why 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.440
 I have not taken any lipsic cream 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.210
 problem is just the colors i found 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.520
 it's a beautiful one so a great one 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.800
 wrapping a beautiful red one 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.270
 beautiful orangery sochi with 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.850
 a slight chorale though 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.610
 actually rather cheesy and a 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.170
 pink but all three colors are nothing 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.400
 special and I already have them 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.190
 I already have her, I already have her 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.130
 as queen place even as cream to paula 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.060
 or as richie queen and that's why 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.060
 it pinched me again 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.300
 Accordingly, I can now too 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.980
 Do not say how many cards I believe 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.640
 I was not a tester of them 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.920
 taste what was there then that the 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.510
 Shimmer brother, I found pretty 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.860
 Slippery so I found it really mega 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.870
 Spitzweg with us are test games 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.240
 meant where there was no tester 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.470
 that's why she took it with me, I know 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.730
 not if she's happy with it now 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.630
 or not what did not she say 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.810
 so me personally too low and 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.370
 the nail sticker or nail foil that 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.500
 is similar so mine there I am yes 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.690
 always very nice patterns are already 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.930
 Nice but I'm just really easy 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.610
 just so that's not the type for nail art i 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.920
 I just want to have that highlighted and then 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.600
 is good 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.850
 yes, and then I do not even think so 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.980
 for a kajalstift that still existed 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.330
 but I did not think so now 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.690
 good especially the gray was already 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.030
 kind of nice but I'm not 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.710
 Stadtmensch I use if then one 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.990
 felt eyeliner and otherwise yes okay the 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.910
 My heart and I were now to say 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.010
 Hope it was useful and the first one 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.090
 impression helped you when you were 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.770
 you want to hunt a product now 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.560
 or it is not that bad 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.360
 Overall, I would certify that 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.490
 It's okay, but not the same 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.320
 Mord Hammer I still miss one 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.810
 hollywood walk away me from patrice 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.420
 somehow this year there were none 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.850
 which blew me away so mega mega but 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.130
 I just hope that's it 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.120
 Maybe we will see you soon 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.310
 but let's see 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.630
 Ok, thanks, we watched
