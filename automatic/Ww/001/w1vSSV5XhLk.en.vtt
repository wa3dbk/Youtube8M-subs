00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
what you'll have with that is a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.189 
what you'll have with that is a
completely<00:00:44.339> flat<00:00:44.629> roof<00:00:45.629> section<00:00:45.989> here

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
completely flat roof section here

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.410 
completely flat roof section here
ardently<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.070> raised<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.730> section<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.210> here

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ardently the raised on section just here

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.149 
ardently the raised on section just here
but<00:00:48.960> it'll<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.670> two<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.329> large<00:00:52.159> windows

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
but it'll have two very large windows

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.039 
but it'll have two very large windows
and<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> ceiling<00:00:53.790> effectively<00:00:54.329> which<00:00:54.839> will

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
and the ceiling effectively which will

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.170 
and the ceiling effectively which will
slide<00:00:55.229> back<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.619> open<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.100> rb2<00:00:56.430> were<00:00:56.970> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
slide back and open an rb2 were the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.119 
slide back and open an rb2 were the
windows<00:00:57.479> further<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.019> and<00:00:58.589> that<00:00:58.739> means<00:00:58.860> this

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
windows further back and that means this

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
windows further back and that means this
small<00:00:59.309> area<00:00:59.580> will<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.939> funny<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
small area will get funny would like and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.570 
small area will get funny would like and
you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:01.619> have<00:01:02.009> the<00:01:02.159> obviously<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
you can also have the obviously the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
ventilation with the roof open so this

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
ventilation with the roof open so this

they<00:02:09.649> put<00:02:09.830> ventilation<00:02:10.369> into<00:02:10.550> each<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
they put ventilation into each the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.490 
they put ventilation into each the
cabins<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.360> can<00:02:11.600> make<00:02:11.780> import<00:02:12.200> right<00:02:12.320> on

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
cabins so you can make import right on

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.920 
cabins so you can make import right on
both<00:02:12.650> sides<00:02:12.980> here<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.370> also<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.360> course<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
both sides here and also of course the

both sides here and also of course the
mobile<00:02:15.080> full<00:02:15.380> hatch<00:02:15.560> above<00:02:15.740> which<00:02:16.040> means<00:02:16.280> they

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
mobile full hatch above which means they

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.800 
mobile full hatch above which means they
don't<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> run<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:17.300> air<00:02:17.390> conditioning

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
don't have to run your air conditioning

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.100 
don't have to run your air conditioning
or<00:02:17.990> mine<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.360> after<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.810> you've<00:02:21.080> got

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
or mine and just after that you've got

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.710 
or mine and just after that you've got
quite<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.530> decent-sized<00:02:22.160> guest<00:02:22.580> cabin<00:02:22.940> with<00:02:23.690> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
quite a decent-sized guest cabin with a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.350 
quite a decent-sized guest cabin with a
couple<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.110> single<00:02:24.380> berths<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.360> finally

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
couple of single berths in it finally

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
couple of single berths in it finally
this<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.780> third<00:02:26.960> cabin<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.860> living

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
this is the third cabin now as a living

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.470 
this is the third cabin now as a living
quite<00:02:28.520> clever<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.060> because<00:02:29.330> they've

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
quite clever with this because they've

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.380 
quite clever with this because they've
realized<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.380> size<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.800> boat

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
realized that on this size of boat

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.610 
realized that on this size of boat
inevitably<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.630> third<00:02:32.810> Kevin<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.320> tenancy

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
inevitably the third Kevin just tenancy

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.680 
inevitably the third Kevin just tenancy
it<00:02:33.710> uses<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> storage<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.730> also<00:02:35.240> we<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.510> got<00:02:35.660> a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it uses a storage so also we have got a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.570 
it uses a storage so also we have got a
single<00:02:35.870> bid<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.440> cannon<00:02:36.680> what<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.400> can

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
single bid on this cannon what you can

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.400 
single bid on this cannon what you can
have<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.050> without<00:02:39.230> just

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
have with this is if it without just

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.100 
have with this is if it without just
purely<00:02:39.740> as<00:02:39.920> locker<00:02:40.130> space<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:41.239> if<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.450> almost
