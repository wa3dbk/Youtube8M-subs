00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
background and the way I see the world

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.120 
background and the way I see the world
I'm<00:02:19.610> very<00:02:20.120> particular<00:02:20.450> as<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.140> person<00:02:21.710> everyone

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I'm very particular as a person everyone

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.680 
I'm very particular as a person everyone
assumes<00:02:22.580> that's<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> case<00:02:23.270> with<00:02:23.540> their

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
assumes that's the case with their

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
assumes that's the case with their
surgeon<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> really<00:02:24.770> isn't<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.190> case<00:02:25.220> I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
surgeon but that really isn't the case I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.090 
surgeon but that really isn't the case I
mean<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.210> am<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.810> fastidious<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.890> think

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
mean I am very fastidious and I think

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.520 
mean I am very fastidious and I think
that<00:02:28.250> really<00:02:28.610> makes<00:02:29.030> all<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.990> difference<00:02:30.110> at

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
that really makes all the difference at

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.980 
that really makes all the difference at
the<00:02:30.650> end<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:31.070> get<00:02:31.220> an<00:02:31.340> amazing<00:02:31.940> rather<00:02:32.720> than<00:02:32.930> a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
the end to get an amazing rather than a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.170 
the end to get an amazing rather than a
good<00:02:33.200> result<00:02:33.500> after<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> surgery<00:02:34.730> there<00:02:35.000> was

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
good result after the surgery there was

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.940 
good result after the surgery there was
almost<00:02:35.390> no<00:02:35.750> pain<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.320> mean<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.650> was<00:02:36.770> really

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
almost no pain I mean it was really

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
almost no pain I mean it was really
strange<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.490> he<00:02:37.610> told<00:02:37.850> me<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> would<00:02:38.210> be<00:02:38.330> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
strange and he told me it would be that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.990

I was dying to look and I couldn't

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.650 
I was dying to look and I couldn't
really<00:02:45.620> say<00:02:45.920> anything<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:47.540> the
