00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.630
 Hi guys, how are you and the rams? 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.490
 you and here I am again in the main 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.059
 craft with one of his tutorials that 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.710
 you like them so much and that the truth every time 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.150
 you are asking me for more tutorials you think 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.340
 new tutorials well then this 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.899
 tutorials we are going to make a portal of 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.269
 hell but it has a different form 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.410
 let's make a tornado in a portal 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.360
 Hell washed with water and because it 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.449
 we need for it well then in 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.420
 concrete are lava cubes we need 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.489
 12 sorry 14 cubes of lava and 1 of water 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.070
 that is, a portal can be made 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.430
 of hell only having iron 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.619
 well that is what we are going to do as 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.619
 you saw what they are going to do is first the 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.270
 base of the portal that is a line of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.970
 four obsidian for that what 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.700
 we do is dig in the ground 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.380
 we throw lava over you will see that 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.650
 I'm going to do here again we throw lava and 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.020
 right next to us we throw water and collect from 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.960
 new the water that we throw so the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.720
 lava becomes obsidian so what 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.510
 I'm going to do in a block of four that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.940
 is going to be the base of the portal 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.850
 absolutely the same we made another of 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.040
 lava to the side we throw the water and turns 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.860
 lava in obsidian well this you have already 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.000
 seen in more than one how-to tutorial 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.830
 get obsidian 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.260
 thus making a generator a 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.760
 obsidian regenerator fine but what 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.560
 what are we going to do here is the portal 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.110
 directly without having to chop for 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.410
 nothing the obsidian well I'll make a 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.560
 base vale is a base of contention 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.630
 lateral at one end of the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.910
 part below and what we are going to do is 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.350
 go climbing up okay let's go 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.360
 because it 's going to go up here 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.149
 we can not we will not go up 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.580
 let's make a contention we take 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.400
 new lava and next to water 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.910
 continuously until the height is generated 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.100
 necessary to have the portal and before 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.840
 I want nothing to tell you why I want to give 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.850
 thanks to a we have subscribers 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.640
 called tnt predator that was the one that 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.989
 he explained how to do this the truth that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.910
 It is very good because there were many people 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.010
 I was saying to see how you could get 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 the diamonds that cost him a lot 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.760
 get the diamonds I wanted 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.950
 make the portal to get the achievement but 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.020
 that clear that the subject of diamonds 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.180
 it was a little complicated then this 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.950
 my subscriber told me how to do it without 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.660
 need to have diamonds to sting 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.130
 obsidian and the truth that is very 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.070
 well it's very simple 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.920
 and it's very quick to tell you 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.080
 I take the opportunity to tell us that the best 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.980
 way to get the diamonds is in 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.130
 the layer between layer 12 and 18 but it 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.590
 says that the best area is layer 15 that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.740
 that appears on the map is worth in the layer 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.420
 15 of depth 15 is the best for 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.550
 get diamonds but good what 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.700
 let's say once we already build one of 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.700
 the sides I remove the earth all and 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 I do the same on the other side in this 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.520
 case is going to be on the right side well 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.290
 pick up all the cubes and now I'm going to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.640
 do the same thing now I'm going to paste 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.770
 a small cut so that it is not done 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.830
 too long and I 'll explain how 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.310
 do the top part also 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.690
 having a base of support is worth what 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.700
 I said remember they are 14 lava cubes and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.890
 1 of water apart you have to have 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.110
 I'm doing the base right there 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.420
 containment on top of the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.690
 portal what I have to do is there 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.660
 there is a small one small contention 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.720
 so that the lava does not fall 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.810
 and placed a mass of earth made there the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.250
 lava and right next to throw again of 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.290
 again the water you see is very 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.350
 simple to do does not have any 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.680
 complication is making the portal 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.140
 directly generating getting the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.079
 obsidian in a natural way without having 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.090
 to chop the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.780
 and the truth is that it is a different way to 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.400
 make a portal I keep saying there 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.460
 many ways to do it but 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.639
 this is the easiest way to do 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.340
 a portal starting a map nine times 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.509
 if you want to start a new map one 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.379
 for example those seeds that I am 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.810
 going up that they really are 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.370
 fantastic without having to wait for 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.349
 get diamond to make the portal 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.759
 well only with getting the lava and 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.039
 get iron that is not so 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.689
 complicated to get the truth that 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.610
 you can do it quickly and 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.420
 there you see I have completely done 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.520
 only thing that is missing is to turn it on 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.740
 at the same time that I'm going to light them tell you 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 guys please things you know how to do 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.780
 tutorials in my game such that ram is 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.190
 sutep send me a much better message 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.530
 than youtube because you can also 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.030
 send it but better someone tag me 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
 you send a message saying what they are 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.580
 the ideas that you have I put in 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.980
 contact with you we make the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.110
 recording something else guys please 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.790
 comment to your friends on this channel 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.430
 so that if they know and do the 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.380
 minecraft community grow 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.180
 thank you very much subscribe and if I 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.900
 you give a like would make me and happy
