00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.270
 when a preseason game between 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.129
 the cougars in leÃ³n guanajuato a match 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.710
 of preseason between the pumas and the 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.910
 pachuca ends tied at 0 will be 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.910
 definition of penal 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.630
 the goalie of the turkey directed 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.710
 I think the biggest pressure has 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.420
 the shooter one of the important keys 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.490
 is that a goalkeeper holds up to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.870
 last moment to be able to receive towards 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.340
 a back winnow are games 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.900
 professionals that I in the end too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.520
 they are human beings who also arrive 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.990
 nervous or doubt I have to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.070
 take advantage of any weakness that you can 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.070
 have the rival to be able to 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.260
 you feel a great emotion we recover there 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.909
 like that trust but even if you know 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.409
 that you can not celebrate until you 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.409
 finish the round the five penal 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 if the pikolin stops the next metal 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 the cougars would score the first win 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.170
 of the quadrangular 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.000
 do not try that the ball is left 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 exactly in the criminal bulge helping 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.550
 to that pressure so that the comfortable in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.550
 a place where I want 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.569
 the arms try that the goal be 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.099
 a smaller one or that I see bigger 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.780
 and augured more goal you have to 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.280
 use as many weapons as you can and have 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.280
 to be able to try for a penalty 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.940
 in the end 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.740
 it's always important to start winning 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.930
 and the team did already have the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.430
 next game on Saturday against 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.530
 team that wins and we make is a lion 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.300
 but always the player goes much more 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.030
 quiet because you get to advance to 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.630
 the final clarifies and that always leaves you 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 very calm 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.780
 and calm and nervous 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:11.920
 it seems perfectly applied to me in 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.300
 class with you with the clips for 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.250
 criminals and good we are here is when 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:26.940
 on the court thank you here with the figure 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.940
 of the hero boy 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.510
 formally company to contribute toward 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.210
 the team is very good we are already there 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.770
 for 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.770
 in the past week 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.580
 sanctified be your name 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.950
 also us but temptation all 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.950
 wrong 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.560
 do not 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.320
 match on the team 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.770
 adventure and good luckily finals 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.770
 you can take it out 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.860
 but what we expected the team is 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.250
 hard we still say 15 days of beach 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:35.150
 very strong we come to let go but 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:35.150
 also the party the cougar shirt 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.009
 the party that we have of preseason and 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.930
 We saw two intense weeks on the beach and 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.940
 it is normal for us to feel in this 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.169
 moment is not the best way 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.910
 football not for this alone these 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.199
 games for the central 12 but I think that 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.129
 the team looks pretty good to us 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.889
 we face a tough rival 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.289
 How nice football is passion is the 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.020
 same adrenaline that you turn it on 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.749
 It has always been a remarkable trick 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.309
 offering his affection his affection that is 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.819
 something that for every soccer player has 

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.819
 a lot of value
