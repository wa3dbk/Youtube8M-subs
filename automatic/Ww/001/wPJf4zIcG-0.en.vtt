one of the check valves here of course
it's<00:00:05.970> keep<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.450> water<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.080> after<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> pump

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
it's keep the water that after the pump

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.490 
it's keep the water that after the pump
pumps<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.700> fire<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.240> keep<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.599> water

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
one this one it's gravity and it's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
one this one it's gravity and it's
better<00:00:35.130> than<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.460> spring<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> brings

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
better than a spring because this brings

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.420 
better than a spring because this brings
corrode<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.329> results<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> problems<00:00:40.440> ok

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
corrode and the results in problems ok

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.690 
corrode and the results in problems ok
we'll<00:00:41.610> run<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.180> slow<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:46.370> okay<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
we'll run it very slow here okay at this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.260 
we'll run it very slow here okay at this
point<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.260> tuckies<00:00:49.710> water<00:00:50.010> ok<00:00:50.760> when

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
point we can be tuckies water ok when

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500 
point we can be tuckies water ok when
you<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.600> below<00:00:52.399> there<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> peel<00:00:53.789> water

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you down below there the peel water

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.189 
you down below there the peel water
comes<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:56.870> travel<00:00:57.870> over

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
comes up this right here travel over

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.760 
comes up this right here travel over
here<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.149> set<00:01:00.449> bail<00:01:00.750> once<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.260> put<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
here have to set bail once it put the

water get past it and fall here it can't
come<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.729> ball<00:01:06.000> feels<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.830> heat

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

the water up in this direction the water

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.429 
the water up in this direction the water
gets<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> water<00:01:12.600> gets<00:01:12.900> past<00:01:13.170> this

gets up here the water gets past this
ball<00:01:13.770> water<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:15.060> cool<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> only<00:01:16.140> go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
ball water can cool down it can only go

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
ball water can cool down it can only go
this<00:01:16.770> direction<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.659> walk<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this direction here and then walk to the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.999 
this direction here and then walk to the
far<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:20.450> just<00:01:21.450> lying<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
far side just lying here that you see is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.070 
far side just lying here that you see is
broken

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
broken

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.700 
broken
it's<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.409> speaker<00:01:26.070> tubing<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.759> removed<00:01:27.710> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it's the speaker tubing is removed but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
it's the speaker tubing is removed but
I'm<00:01:28.860> done<00:01:29.040> running<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.520> boat<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.259> add<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
I'm done running the boat and I add a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
I'm done running the boat and I add a
little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> oil<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.909> into<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
little bit of oil right into here and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
little bit of oil right into here and
let<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> oil<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.590> sucked<00:01:34.950> down<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
let the oil get sucked down into the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.460 
let the oil get sucked down into the
system<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.290> through<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> check<00:01:38.640> valve<00:01:39.079> as<00:01:40.079> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
system here through the check valve as I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
system here through the check valve as I
sometimes<00:01:41.070> don't<00:01:41.520> run<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> boat<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
sometimes don't run this boat for a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.090 
sometimes don't run this boat for a
period<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> year<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> even<00:01:45.090> though<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
period of the year and even though the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.639 
period of the year and even though the
bolts<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.700> stainless<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
bolts out here are stainless it's just a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.580 
bolts out here are stainless it's just a
safety<00:01:49.950> precaution

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
safety precaution

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.100 
safety precaution
so<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:52.460> was<00:01:52.640> about<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.450> can<00:01:53.600> say<00:01:53.990> about

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
so this was about all I can say about

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.179 
so this was about all I can say about
that<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:55.610> water<00:01:55.850> point<00:01:56.710> rather<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.920> little

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
that the water point rather the little

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.410 
that the water point rather the little
floor<00:01:58.990> and<00:02:00.159> I'll<00:02:01.159> try<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.490> zoom<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
floor and I'll try to zoom in on it a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.800 
floor and I'll try to zoom in on it a
little<00:02:02.630> bit<00:02:02.780> more<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.240> why<00:02:05.420> do<00:02:05.479> you

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
little bit more here this is why do you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.250 
little bit more here this is why do you
have<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:05.990> problem<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.070> do
