00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello to my mafia total 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.850
 of course you know one of the most successful 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.830
 of the most popular games in the racing series 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.900
 nid foid speed and thirst for speed 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.270
 I don't really like this genre at all and not 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.690
 especially follow the developments 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.900
 related 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.880
 series need for speed but the announcement of the film by 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.370
 I am not surprised at this game 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.680
 and honestly I was waiting for creation 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:35.180
 directing that which personally for 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.219
 I was known for nothing and in general 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.769
 film play not particularly famous actors 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.460
 however in spite of this film turned out 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.679
 not bad 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.929
 and why I will tell in this review 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.030
 let's start with the actor 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.550
 composition he is here for a famous lecture 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.550
 I don't really know much, of course 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.539
 Arma for which became famous thanks 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.969
 sturdy fish suddenly 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.129
 that is, in all the serious number of growth schools 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.589
 saw Dominic Cooper somewhere and found out 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.019
 michael whiton was very upset that 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.360
 Anton thirst for speed was constantly 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.210
 identical more than he is good 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 played only anger wrath of rage in places 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.810
 sadness in the wine in any case not 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.880
 actor and director 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.969
 for the film can only be said 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.640
 progress rage and anger spruce energized 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.469
 however for good emotions and acting 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.659
 armu game chopped off thanks 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.939
 he did not draw the son about the character 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.430
 Dominic Cooper Manolo will not speak 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.680
 he did not seem boring and very 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.630
 predictable and indeed the whole movie can 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.759
 say clichÃ©ed besides these 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.859
 more or less known names slim 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.049
 present and the opinion of famous actors 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.270
 who are trying to pull pictures 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.789
 attempts to make a joke and laugh in every possible way 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.219
 the viewer sometimes they get it 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.500
 sometimes not really and sometimes not at all 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.600
 It turns out for example I did not understand at all 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.060
 humor in the section of none of the characters 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.149
 that is, dude is just shooting himself 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.100
 jacket pants and shirt tie and even 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.649
 cowards and just about using naked 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.770
 on office me these absurd minutes movie 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.520
 showed absolutely not funny and 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.009
 totally incomprehensible 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.979
 what it was who did it at all and 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.560
 why the answer to these questions I never 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.910
 received but another fly in the ointment 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 new movie soundtrack 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.060
 it is to the minus of the film, it seems to be said 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.340
 now right 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 talk about the pros and there they are definitely 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 there is very pleased that thirst 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.520
 there is a huge speed 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.160
 number doroguschy on beautiful 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.590
 sports cars and I was pleasantly surprised 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.750
 the fact that wolves and chases are made to glory 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.989
 there are tense moments in every race 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.810
 audible and three motors screeching tires flashes 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.489
 arno's full face full cooper 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.290
 Overall, this is all very happy on 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.800
 what's happening is really interesting 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.769
 watch 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.510
 personal as well as the scenes were delighted in 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.910
 I want to say that the movie is thirsty 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.340
 speed can go especially if u 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.799
 fan nedforspid may be for someone 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.840
 it will be little but believe a ron gender and 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.880
 well made chase really 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.220
 drags the whole movie separately want to say 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.470
 that to me as a gamer is insanely nice 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.480
 see such movies on games last 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.640
 Mighty film on the game that I saw 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.069
 was max payne but the thirst for speed still 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.040
 I'd rather want to believe that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.959
 soon the world will see even better 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.970
 video game movies 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.130
 the film is speed speed 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.470
 I put everyone with a half point out of ten 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.109
 pleased me well made chase 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 and are on pool but disappointed acting 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.000
 some other actors play dull 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.579
 soundtrack and banal plot but on this 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.209
