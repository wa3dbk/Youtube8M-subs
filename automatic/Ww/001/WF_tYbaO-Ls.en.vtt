00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 a boy who conquered the stadium 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 at his first league game 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.540
 because today I don't know if you've made it 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 I count but when you left the ball and chain 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.759
 those dribbles whose tunnels with the changes of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.720
 direction the people exhilarated us 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.570
 congratulations thank you when I see of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.369
 feel this affection of the fans that you 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 he told maicon many times there in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.859
 times of the treble which condemned that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.960
 everyone got up so I was already 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.329
 dreaming with this today I had 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 the thrill of feeling this slice of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 fans who were born near the goal on 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 goalkeeper was good though sixth good 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 also to take it back and make goals to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 osvaldo in that action if then did 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 good going down but it 's okay by is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 maybe he did very well and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 moved a little too far though 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.199
 the important thing is that I keep the action 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.899
 so we are all happy 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.640
 maybe alessandro period completely 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 obviously for the game of mine 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 question concerns but where according to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.609
 me someone you're eating your hands 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 my question is this year 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.020
 last if with you you have seen 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.670
 obviously you've lived the team has 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.260
 played from Rome to match after match 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.119
 acquire awareness and then arrive 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
 to make an important second championship 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.619
 in the interior there are the premises for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 do something like this 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.009
 compared to what I did rome 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 last year is a team that can 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.750
 fight to the end to annoy a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.210
 all up to the last according to me yes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 according to me yes what he did 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.229
 I think the difference is more 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.979
 last year in Rome it is the group that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 it is created 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.290
 we had a very united group that did 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 he was fine together and I see this 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 even here you were good at managing 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.390
 these things yet not the pure andrea 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.979
 as captain then as a group I see 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 very good when things are going well 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.540
 out of the field when you're in the field 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 always try to help then second 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.409
 me last year this did a lot 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 the difference with other players of 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.299
 experience as maicon and suns that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.390
 have managed this group and this year 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.870
 I see healing 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.910
 that are helping us do a lot 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.280
 group and this is certainly a lot 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.569
 very important hello from compliments between 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 the other is this group if we want 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.400
 even much younger is not the fact 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.140
 just to feel good even outside the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 field that make some sense 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.180
 facilitated because you entered immediately 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.690
 in the mechanisms of the saints team 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.820
 have only arrived this summer games 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.459
 almost by heart, that is, you immediately understood 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.900
 what the coach wanted from you and you look 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.720
 always in this team 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.209
 yes this if as other than the group is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.010
 much of the coach's job 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.590
 repetitions from time to time are also i 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.640
 facts also fatigue but it is that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.130
 which imparted then makes the difference i 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.890
 days there in Pinzolo also in America 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.230
 all friendly tests this has me 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 helped and helped both the teams that i 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.739
 movements always remember and then one 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.750
 with comets with the quality you have in 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.700
 crossing can also be wrong 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.290
 corner kick from time to time but not yes 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 he must get angry because then the quality 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.060
 there can happen then take saw that 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.950
 today the game is not wrong yes it is a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.500
 Arabic because I don't like to make mistakes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.650
 so the radio weapons then seemed to me 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.790
 closing is a perfectionist is a good one 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.860
