00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.800 
window tint so overall I was really
pleased<00:04:01.880> with<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.180> shadow<00:04:02.450> light<00:04:02.630> I'd

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
pleased with this shadow light I'd

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.350 
pleased with this shadow light I'd
actually<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.769> again<00:04:04.120> with<00:04:05.120> more

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
actually like to do it again with more

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.240 
actually like to do it again with more
elaborate<00:04:05.870> flames<00:04:06.170> probably<00:04:06.739> something<00:04:07.130> that

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
elaborate flames probably something that

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.550 
elaborate flames probably something that
would<00:04:07.370> go<00:04:07.459> down<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.820> whole<00:04:08.000> side<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:09.410> would

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
would go down the whole side and I would

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.229 
would go down the whole side and I would
definitely<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:10.100> more<00:04:10.310> careful<00:04:10.730> when<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.880> peel

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
definitely be more careful when I peel

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.600 
definitely be more careful when I peel
up<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:12.380> paint<00:04:12.620> mask<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.280> could<00:04:13.489> have

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
up the paint mask so that I could have

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.610 
up the paint mask so that I could have
gotten<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.420> two<00:04:14.660> colors<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.350> flames

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
gotten that the two colors on the flames

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.920 
gotten that the two colors on the flames
because<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.370> do<00:04:16.700> think<00:04:17.090> getting<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.450> outline

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
because I do think getting the outline

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.830 
because I do think getting the outline
around<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.350> flame

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
