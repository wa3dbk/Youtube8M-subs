00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi I'm Nathan and I'm gonna run you

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi I'm Nathan and I'm gonna run you
through<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.449> bit<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.049> rigging<00:00:04.440> that<00:00:04.560> I've

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
through a bit of the rigging that I've

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.860 
through a bit of the rigging that I've
been<00:00:04.890> doing<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.430> have<00:00:06.270> kept<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.629> pretty<00:00:06.750> simple

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
been doing I have kept it pretty simple

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.129 
been doing I have kept it pretty simple
so<00:00:07.319> there's<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.859> know<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.550> few<00:00:08.960> objects<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
so there's you know very few objects to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.039 
so there's you know very few objects to
deal<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.500> his<00:00:11.429> head<00:00:11.790> drags<00:00:12.330> behind<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.900> rest

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
deal with his head drags behind the rest

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.959 
deal with his head drags behind the rest
of<00:00:13.170> them<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.410> he<00:00:13.559> walks<00:00:13.769> they<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.700> upper

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
of them as he walks they have the upper

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.310 
of them as he walks they have the upper
body<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> lower<00:00:15.690> body<00:00:15.929> actually

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
body and the lower body actually

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930 
body and the lower body actually
separate<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.310> drag<00:00:17.640> them<00:00:17.820> around

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
separate so you just drag them around

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
separate so you just drag them around
and<00:00:18.359> there's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.199> nice<00:00:19.289> bit<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> squash<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and there's a nice bit of squash and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070 
and there's a nice bit of squash and
stretch<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> can<00:00:20.520> rotate<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
stretch and you can rotate it and you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
stretch and you can rotate it and you
know<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.380> sorts<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.740> crazy<00:00:23.250> fun<00:00:23.609> stuff<00:00:23.820> like

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
know all sorts of crazy fun stuff like

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.330 
know all sorts of crazy fun stuff like
this<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.779> also<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.680> hand<00:00:26.099> rig

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this so then we also have the hand rig

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.259 
this so then we also have the hand rig
that<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.849> been<00:00:27.000> working<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:30.119> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that I've been working on this is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.549 
that I've been working on this is
similar<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.320> Psalms<00:00:32.239> finger<00:00:33.239> rig<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.410> I've

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
similar to a Psalms finger rig that I've

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.690 
similar to a Psalms finger rig that I've
made<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> few<00:00:35.219> improvements<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.340> you<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.579> way

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
made a few improvements so you the way

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.240 
made a few improvements so you the way
that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.879> operate<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.020> grab<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.680> finger

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that you operate it is you grab a finger

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
that you operate it is you grab a finger
bone<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.090> scale<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.110> make

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bone and you scale it and that will make

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.130 
bone and you scale it and that will make
the<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.950> finger<00:00:44.309> Bend<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> only<00:00:45.899> does

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the the finger Bend but it only does

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
the the finger Bend but it only does
this<00:00:46.649> joints<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.430> joint<00:00:47.850> doesn't<00:00:48.059> do

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this joints and this joint doesn't do

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
this joints and this joint doesn't do
the<00:00:48.329> bass<00:00:48.480> joint<00:00:48.750> only<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.620> middle<00:00:49.920> joint<00:00:50.129> in

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the bass joint only the middle joint in

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.330 
the bass joint only the middle joint in
the<00:00:50.370> tip<00:00:50.520> joints<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.829> scale<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the tip joints so if we scale this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.560 
the tip joints so if we scale this
you'll<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> works

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you'll see how that works

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
you'll see how that works
take<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.260> bone<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.860> scale<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
take this bone I can just scale it and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.650 
take this bone I can just scale it and
it<00:00:56.640> makes<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.360> finger<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.510> one<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it makes the finger and then one of the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
it makes the finger and then one of the
improvements<00:01:00.899> I've<00:01:01.260> made<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
improvements I've made is that if you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
improvements I've made is that if you
scale<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.539> bend<00:01:03.989> backwards

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
scale it out it will bend backwards

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
scale it out it will bend backwards
which<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.739> something<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.309> bassam<00:01:06.090> students

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
which was something that bassam students

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
which was something that bassam students
and<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.409> also<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.310> bone<00:01:08.670> here

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and I also have this little bone here

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
and I also have this little bone here
which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.450> importance<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.530> very<00:01:11.310> important

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
which is importance it's very important

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
which is importance it's very important
to<00:01:11.729> something<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> lot<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> people<00:01:12.540> leave

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to something that a lot of people leave

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
to something that a lot of people leave
out<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> rigs<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> need<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.159> able

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
out of the rigs but you need to be able

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
out of the rigs but you need to be able
to<00:01:14.340> curl<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> hands<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.110> your

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to curl the hands I mean you have your

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
to curl the hands I mean you have your
hand<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> fist<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
hand and you like make a fist like the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
hand and you like make a fist like the
the<00:01:19.200> knuckles<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:19.979> curl<00:01:20.220> over<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the knuckles actually curl over and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
the knuckles actually curl over and
that's<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.479> than<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.780> flat<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's different than this flat like you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's different than this flat like you
actually<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.090> curl<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.900> hand<00:01:25.170> as

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
actually have curl in your your hand as

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.010 
actually have curl in your your hand as
well<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.180> phone<00:01:27.390> does<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> use

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
well and I so this phone does that use

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.609 
well and I so this phone does that use
you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.670> rotate<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.259> makes<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> hand

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you know rotate that and makes the hand

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.700 
you know rotate that and makes the hand
curl<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> what's<00:01:32.369> more<00:01:32.579> convincing<00:01:33.710> clenched

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
curl and what's more convincing clenched

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.249 
curl and what's more convincing clenched
up<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.810> curl<00:01:37.049> bone<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
up like that with the curl bone so I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
up like that with the curl bone so I
also<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.770> knee<00:01:41.400> targets<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.570> point

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
also have knee targets so you can point

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630 
also have knee targets so you can point
the<00:01:43.259> knee<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.710> whatever<00:01:43.979> direction<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.460> want

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the knee in whatever direction you want

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.539 
the knee in whatever direction you want
to<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> knee<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.860> always<00:01:47.250> point

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to like so so the knee will always point

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
to like so so the knee will always point
at<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.000> target<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.630> regardless<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.290> where

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
at this target so regardless of where

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.760 
at this target so regardless of where
you<00:01:50.159> position<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> leg<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.470> knee<00:01:52.500> will

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you position the leg the knee will

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
you position the leg the knee will
always<00:01:53.130> always<00:01:53.340> follow<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> wrote<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
always always follow this so I wrote a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.380 
always always follow this so I wrote a
high<00:01:56.219> constraint<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.969> constraint

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
high constraint which is a constraint

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.350 
high constraint which is a constraint
that<00:01:57.479> you've<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> write<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.560> Python

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that you've you know you write in Python

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.969 
that you've you know you write in Python
you<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> could<00:02:00.689> take<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.290> things<00:02:01.740> up

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you know you could take little things up

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
you know you could take little things up
and<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.340> all<00:02:02.369> sorts<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> crazy<00:02:02.820> math<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and do all sorts of crazy math and you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560 
and do all sorts of crazy math and you
can<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.110> cool<00:02:04.500> things<00:02:04.560> happen

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
can make cool things happen

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.859 
can make cool things happen
so<00:02:07.580> what<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> did<00:02:08.820> for<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.300> I've<00:02:09.450> made<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so what I did for this is I've made a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
so what I did for this is I've made a
single<00:02:10.200> bone<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.040> by<00:02:11.190> rotating<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.850> one

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
single bone that by rotating just one

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.960 
single bone that by rotating just one
bone<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:13.110> rolls<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.560> foot<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.490> roll<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
bone it rolls the foot so you roll this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.910 
bone it rolls the foot so you roll this
I<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.810> set<00:02:15.990> up<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.650> also

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I have it set up so that you can also

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
I have it set up so that you can also
independently<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.990> move<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
independently you know move this if you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
independently you know move this if you
want<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.270> we'll<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.510> stuff<00:02:21.660> like

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
want to and then we'll just stuff like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.240 
want to and then we'll just stuff like
fast<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.680> overall<00:02:25.980> foot

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
fast and you have the overall foot

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.520 
fast and you have the overall foot
control<00:02:26.580> which<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.020> moving<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
control which is for you know moving it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.460 
control which is for you know moving it
around<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> few

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
around like this you know have a few

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.860 
around like this you know have a few
facial<00:02:31.920> keys<00:02:32.130> here<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.330> controllers

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
facial keys here so have controllers

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.580 
facial keys here so have controllers
that<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:35.700> used<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> pose<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.380> face

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
that you you know used to pose the face

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.560 
that you you know used to pose the face
and<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:39.209> drag<00:02:39.570> them<00:02:39.690> down<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:42.209> more<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.540> less

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
and just drag them down but more or less

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.709 
and just drag them down but more or less
us<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.470> ring
