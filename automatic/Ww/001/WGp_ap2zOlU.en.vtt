00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.590 
I've spent on all the parts at the end
of<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.890> video<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.819> I'll<00:02:21.910> do<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> same<00:02:22.239> for

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
of the video and so I'll do the same for

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.140 
of the video and so I'll do the same for
this<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.350> is<00:02:23.590> eighteen<00:02:24.040> dollars<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:24.580> msy

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
this this is eighteen dollars from msy

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.470 
this this is eighteen dollars from msy
so<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.840> pretty<00:02:26.260> good<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:27.400> got<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> 80

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so that's pretty good it's got a 80

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.680 
so that's pretty good it's got a 80
millimeter<00:02:28.989> fan<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.540> 4,000<00:02:31.540> hours

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
millimeter fan on it and 4,000 hours

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.350 
millimeter fan on it and 4,000 hours
forty<00:02:32.290> thousand<00:02:32.590> hours<00:02:32.709> life<00:02:32.980> expectancy<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
forty thousand hours life expectancy a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.630 
forty thousand hours life expectancy a
long<00:02:34.750> life<00:02:34.959> sleeve<00:02:35.350> bearing<00:02:36.010> blah<00:02:36.400> blah<00:02:36.610> blah

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
long life sleeve bearing blah blah blah

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.390 
long life sleeve bearing blah blah blah
and<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.540> got<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.840> noise<00:02:38.320> output<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.160> about

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
and it's got a noise output of about

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
and it's got a noise output of about
twenty<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.000> despots<00:02:40.690> come<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:40.989> focus<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.769> okay

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
twenty to despots come on focus you okay

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
twenty to despots come on focus you okay
so<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.790> comes<00:02:46.209> with<00:02:46.480> instructions<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
so it comes with instructions and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.180 
so it comes with instructions and
instructions<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:51.880> they<00:02:52.290> yeah<00:02:53.290> yeah<00:02:54.010> those

instructions are they yeah yeah those
are<00:02:54.340> my<00:02:54.430> instructions<00:02:54.670> okay<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.170> here<00:02:56.530> is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
are my instructions okay so this here is

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.550 
are my instructions okay so this here is
cooler<00:02:57.640> itself<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.930> going<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.260> put<00:02:59.440> my

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
cooler itself not going to go put my

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.410 
cooler itself not going to go put my
hands<00:02:59.799> all<00:02:59.890> over<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.640> jump<00:03:00.940> I'll<00:03:01.150> look<00:03:01.299> at

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
hands all over but I jump I'll look at

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680 
hands all over but I jump I'll look at
it<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.820> pretty<00:03:03.820> big<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.209> got<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.390> really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it so it's pretty big it's got a really

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
it so it's pretty big it's got a really
nice<00:03:05.190> fan<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> really<00:03:06.730> good<00:03:06.880> quality<00:03:07.239> quiet

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
nice fan on a really good quality quiet

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.110 
nice fan on a really good quality quiet
blah<00:03:09.130> blah<00:03:09.400> blah<00:03:09.430> or<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.880> heat<00:03:12.880> sink

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
blah blah blah or it is little heat sink

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.940 
blah blah blah or it is little heat sink
leaks<00:03:13.269> wait<00:03:13.450> let's<00:03:13.660> listen<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:16.950> yeah

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
leaks wait let's listen to it on yeah

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.699 
leaks wait let's listen to it on yeah
I'm<00:03:18.430> gonna<00:03:18.579> do<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.329> actually<00:03:19.570> got<00:03:20.340> proper

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
I'm gonna do it it's actually got proper

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.840 
I'm gonna do it it's actually got proper
copper<00:03:23.709> tubing<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.340> actually<00:03:24.670> makes

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
copper tubing that actually makes

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.449 
copper tubing that actually makes
contact<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.690> CPU<00:03:26.200> itself<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:27.280> that's

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
contact with the CPU itself so that's

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.069 
contact with the CPU itself so that's
going<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.730> really<00:03:27.910> good<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.570> think<00:03:28.930> in

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
going to be really good and I think in

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.229 
going to be really good and I think in
the<00:03:29.200> accessories<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.940> should<00:03:31.600> huh<00:03:32.500> said

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the accessories it should huh said

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.020 
the accessories it should huh said
whatever<00:03:34.239> okay<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:38.250> don't<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.489> accessory

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
whatever okay and don't in the accessory

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.480 
whatever okay and don't in the accessory
set<00:03:40.299> up<00:03:41.250> yeah

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.250 

I<00:03:45.610> think<00:03:46.210> it<00:03:46.390> comes<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:48.360> some<00:03:49.360> more<00:03:49.720> chance

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
I think it comes with some more chance

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.650 
I think it comes with some more chance
to<00:03:50.500> mount<00:03:50.680> another<00:03:50.800> fan<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.760> doing<00:03:52.600> this

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
to mount another fan on it doing this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.240 
to mount another fan on it doing this
right<00:03:52.900> hand<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.260> quite<00:03:53.470> difficult<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.070> keep

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
right hand is quite difficult so keep

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.590 
right hand is quite difficult so keep
that<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.400> mind<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.700> know<00:03:54.820> if<00:03:55.210> you're<00:03:55.480> off

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
that in mind I know if you're off

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.750 
that in mind I know if you're off
watching<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.170> probably<00:03:56.200> watched

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
watching this you probably watched

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.540 
watching this you probably watched
multiple<00:03:57.760> unboxings<00:03:58.540> but<00:03:58.810> people<00:03:59.710> tend<00:04:00.400> to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
multiple unboxings but people tend to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.830 
multiple unboxings but people tend to
say<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.940> that's<00:04:01.540> true<00:04:03.000> everyone<00:04:04.000> at<00:04:04.300> yet<00:04:04.630> but
