00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.190

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.130
 Basil is not behind the scenes as always helps 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.290
 their graph and today we are in nature in 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.740
 lovely atmosphere close cook api 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.619
 the role of a syringe or syringe as anyone more 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.699
 like the letter 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.289
 slip the austrian roots of this 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.470
 cocktails so still correct it 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.380
 a syringe but here are bars everywhere including 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.029
 write through with for some reason in our 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.890
 an improvised bar has it all 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.560
 necessary to cook 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.620
 from mineral water own api role 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.510
 it's a bitter and champagne for his 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.910
 classic preparations are used 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 prosecco sparkling wine dry 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.710
 if you have not do not worry I'm here 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 at home a couple of days ago did at all 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.200
 regular champagne I was there whale 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.570
 stocks 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.810
 principle, too, is normal history 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.720
 this cocktail as always in it 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.540
 disagreement and that and another point of view 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.340
 converges on the fact that the cocktail came up 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.829
 military only first point of view 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.789
 says that the cocktail was coined during 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.509
 World War I when troops 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.890
 Austro-Hungary during the offensive 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.249
 took possession 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.530
 region of Veneto and actually where 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.679
 bashir in this region they started drinking 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.630
 local wine that they found there 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.399
 and in large quantities it was 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.299
 prosecco that's why how would it 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.600
 taken to use 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.179
 but for them this wine was a little over 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.609
 stronger than the Austrians are accustomed to their 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.579
 sort of homely and so they 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.520
 diluted with water there is still such 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.579
 point of view that in the austrian region 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.179
 a glass in principle there is such a tradition 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.959
 old wine diluted with soda as it were 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.959
 maybe here they are 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.130
 not at all taking the opportunity they mean 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.990
 diluted local stocks 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.610
 2 points of view says that too 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.780
 came up with mean Australian military 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.570
 the whole thing but much later 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.050
 around the middle of the 19th century 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.210
 when the region is the same veneto and the crown and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.760
 they were part of the Austrian Empire 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.370
 and accordingly , now in its open spaces 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 but in the same region the same was invented 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.990
 the very thing that is to dilute not 1 is not second 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 the story does not tell us who 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.810
 I thought of adding a bitter in general 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.880
 these are the cocktail cases that turned out 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.190
 even tastier it is actually very 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.230
 tasty and even if you just dilute 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.670
 some species 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.470
 gazirovochki if you want to make them not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.140
 so strong and if you have a home 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.110
 also a bit as if it were beautiful 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 today we use the classics 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.180
 api role low alcohol i see now 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.350
 excessive drinking harms 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 to your health 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.239
 but by the way I would always know to go for it 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
 conscious of course if you do not have 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.880
 api role and you can use 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.739
 campari in this case is a variation 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.790
 a cocktail called black syringe 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.610
 darker black syringe and even white 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 it is without adding any beater but 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.180
 it is served somewhere only here in this 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.400
 the region here there was a childhood 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.680
 invented here there is up to such as 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.680
 white white white syringe of course of course 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.420
 proceed to the cooking process us 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.030
 need a glass we need a sheet 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.239
 for we have unfortunately no champagne 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.150
 we have a warm cocktail too 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.420
 very refreshing in itself very 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.320
 deliciously so fruity a little bit 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.320
 bitter because it's all the same 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.730
 bitter we add there but is 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.370
 low alcohol as it were 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.280
 prefer those who prefer to drink 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.459
 alcohol and not get drunk and he is the last 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.350
 time has become very popular aperol very 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.620
 actively spins on every 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.989
 bars exhibit girls 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.989
 promo which give there type 2 3 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.950
 for free, all these things are 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.390
 really but this classic 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.310
 cocktail international association 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.379
 bartenders he is preparing there means in theory 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.959
 we should be a glass to the top 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.829
 let's fall asleep do not despair with ice 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.880
 this one more ice racing this this much 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.470
 a lot of ice and fill this ice to the top 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.930
 simply 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.199
 practically up to the top with champagne 3 parts 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.210
 champagne two parts aperol 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.780
 and one part or free space 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.430
 which will remain poured water 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.229
 fizzy ordinary i think nobody us 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.690
 will not judge strictly that we ai n't no 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.389
 do not drag a glass for a picnic 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.580
 wines in all bars are poured as it were in 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.580
 Rocks actually take time dead 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.130
 there is ice and, as it were, come on, come on 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.760
 tor you will help me 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:54.250
 I can of course helped already on sneakers 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.840
 i 'm sorry further means api videos 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.479
 snowball does not brightly kill food and . 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.190
 But if we add comparison again 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.280
 will be much darker therefore her 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.479
 own black called and mineral 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.190
 one piece checks 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.000
 that will give you try to count every 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.000
 give them a try 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.509
 it is surprisingly much cooler than there 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.119
 golem champagne which pours 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.199
 of course was the cheapest store worth 

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:28.029
 0 rubles there is such a no odalisque 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.009
 just take it away remove all one he 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.559
 smelled very long standing by us just 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.679
 take out of it is very easy because in 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.569
 api the role in it of the fortress is something like this 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.729
 like champagne there palm 11 degrees 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.369
 that's why he's so refreshing 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.059
 say in Venice every day 300 thousand 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:47.189
 of these cocktails we drink along with 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:53.649
 by the Venetians 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:55.869
 pass, I thought that he must 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:57.519
 will be to them and got drunk before the book of you 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:01.179
 so I told you that do not worry all 

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:03.039
 there will be no one worth experiencing and home 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:05.649
 khaled ended did too without ice 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.629
 that's because of the light cocktails that people 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:08.979
 asking the type where to start a home bar 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.479
 I think this is ideal 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.179
 that here it is a bottle of nothing there 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.909
 your not my 700 rubles it costs 

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:18.639
 enough and very long here but it depends 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:22.149
 from the way you kill to him two you can 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:26.709
 conveniently in u sandal 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:28.769
 It costs as a video and the age is not the same 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:31.179
 and 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:33.939
 sponsor of our aqua mineral program 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:36.729
 too inexpensive drink enough 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:39.189
 so these wise guys don't get drunk 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.839

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.639
