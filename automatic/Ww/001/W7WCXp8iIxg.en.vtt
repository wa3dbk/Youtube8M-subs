00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 I signed you because I made a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.980
 put here and put some 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.899
 institutions of stone right then let's 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.950
 I came here in the blacksmith's oven or in the

 fireplace 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.960
 there you see in this last block here is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.010

 1 234 in the fifth you put the stone 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.650
 account four places stone here in the fifth 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 There you jump 1234 stone turns right 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 1234 stone then it will be that a square 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.450
 5 for 5 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.189
 it means you see one two three four 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 five six for six 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.320
 This puts stone in the tips right here. 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.310
 you can see that here is a space of 4 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.180
 counting on the corners of the 606 by 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 61 for 4 1 for 4141 jump four blocks 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 some quiet beauty 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 forgiveness is not every time you go 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.329

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.329
 This is going to put here here. 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:51.210
 so that right and then in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 Then it's only you come here to put three 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.829

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.860
 automatic calm the staff then here 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.500
 we made a base and it's very simple 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.099
 Now you take ladder from 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.660
 gravel or other material that you 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.990

 always put one here and the other here 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.160
 Because it 's water gets infinite you can 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.730
 pick up an empty bucket and tiago from here 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.310

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.140
 again 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.850
