using<00:01:17.679> burst<00:01:17.920> transmission<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:19.179> seems<00:01:19.450> he<00:01:19.570> was

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
using burst transmission it seems he was

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.859 
using burst transmission it seems he was
transmitting<00:01:20.229> from<00:01:20.380> somewhere<00:01:20.740> on<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.310> base
