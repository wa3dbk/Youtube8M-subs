okay<00:00:02.509> here's<00:00:03.509> the<00:00:03.719> Volvo<00:00:05.780> 2001<00:00:06.780> PNL<00:00:07.650> 630<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
okay here's the Volvo 2001 PNL 630 and

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.049 
okay here's the Volvo 2001 PNL 630 and
installed<00:00:09.450> its<00:00:09.600> hydrogen<00:00:09.809> fuel<00:00:10.110> cell<00:00:10.350> I<00:00:11.059> am

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
installed its hydrogen fuel cell I am

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.660 
installed its hydrogen fuel cell I am
standing<00:00:12.720> over<00:00:12.930> here<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.470> can<00:00:13.650> talk<00:00:13.920> because

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
standing over here so I can talk because

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.859 
standing over here so I can talk because
obviously<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.330> truck<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.780> really<00:00:16.769> loud<00:00:17.869> I'm

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
obviously the truck is really loud I'm

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689 
obviously the truck is really loud I'm
going<00:00:19.079> to<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.230> an<00:00:19.320> accurate<00:00:19.529> measurement<00:00:19.800> on

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
going to get an accurate measurement on

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.839 
going to get an accurate measurement on
the<00:00:21.689> production<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.439> hho<00:00:22.949> gas<00:00:23.189> coming<00:00:23.579> out<00:00:23.730> of

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
the production of hho gas coming out of

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.889 
the production of hho gas coming out of
this<00:00:23.939> fuel<00:00:24.149> cell<00:00:26.569> since<00:00:27.569> I'm<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.839> the

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:27.899 
this fuel cell since I'm out in the

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.300 
this fuel cell since I'm out in the
middle<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> nowhere<00:00:28.499> I<00:00:28.529> don't<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.159> any

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
middle of nowhere I don't have any

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.589 
middle of nowhere I don't have any
measuring<00:00:29.669> devices<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.239> don't<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.569> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
measuring devices I don't have a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.319 
measuring devices I don't have a
five-gallon<00:00:31.199> bucket<00:00:31.229> of<00:00:31.559> water<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:31.949> anything

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
five-gallon bucket of water or anything

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
five-gallon bucket of water or anything
so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> disconnected<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:35.400> hooked<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so I disconnected it and just hooked it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
so I disconnected it and just hooked it
up<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.060> a<00:00:36.210> bottle<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> water<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
up to a bottle of water so I can get a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
up to a bottle of water so I can get a
visual<00:00:38.580> representation<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.910> fuel<00:00:42.150> cell<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
visual representation the fuel cell it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
visual representation the fuel cell it's
capable<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.830> operating<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.870> 360<00:00:45.870> amps

capable of operating at up to 360 amps

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.070 
capable of operating at up to 360 amps
but<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.530> obviously<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.580> upgrade

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
but you would obviously have to upgrade

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.290 
but you would obviously have to upgrade

would be easy and you can put out about
15<00:01:11.670> liters<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.060> minute<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.390> 200<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:14.579> gonna

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
15 liters a minute at 200 but I'm gonna

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.910 

you'll<00:01:55.340> notice<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.750> no<00:01:56.780> foam<00:01:57.259> coming<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you'll notice there is no foam coming to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:03:01.840 
you'll notice there is no foam coming to
the<00:01:58.009> line<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:59.229> lot<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.439> engineering<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.009> this

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.540 

you<00:03:02.330> will<00:03:02.450> also<00:03:02.630> notice<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.860> no<00:03:03.890> steam

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.730 

now<00:03:09.090> one<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> reasons<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:10.080> oles<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
now one of the reasons I'm oles in a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.340 
now one of the reasons I'm oles in a
single<00:03:11.070> PWM<00:03:11.700> at<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.300> hundred<00:03:12.600> amps<00:03:12.960> total

single PWM at a hundred amps total
maximum<00:03:14.100> output<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:16.410> say<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.880> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
maximum output they say that the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.820 
maximum output they say that the
production<00:03:19.400> maintains<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.520> constant<00:03:20.760> steady

production maintains a constant steady

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.560 
production maintains a constant steady
but<00:03:22.830> also<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:25.050> unit<00:03:26.000> stays<00:03:27.000> cool<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.510> entire

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
but also the unit stays cool the entire

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.480 
but also the unit stays cool the entire
time<00:03:29.000> because<00:03:30.000> heat<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.540> your<00:03:30.900> enemy<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:32.340> do

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
time because heat is your enemy you do

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.240 
time because heat is your enemy you do
not<00:03:32.670> want<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.900> fuel<00:03:34.170> cell<00:03:34.410> fuel<00:03:35.010> cell

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
hot where it starts producing steam so I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.640 
hot where it starts producing steam so I
built<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:39.990> cell<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.530> could<00:03:40.710> take<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.240> 360

good production at 100 amps and it will

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500 
good production at 100 amps and it will
stay<00:03:49.020> cool<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:50.400> hours<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.030> hours<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.450> hours

and<00:04:11.760> wear<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.060> tear<00:04:14.030> now<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.060> could<00:04:15.390> just<00:04:15.570> go

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
and wear and tear now I could just go

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.420 
and wear and tear now I could just go
ahead<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.020> throw<00:04:16.170> in<00:04:16.230> another<00:04:16.440> 100<00:04:16.590> amp<00:04:16.890> PWM

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
ahead and throw in another 100 amp PWM

ahead and throw in another 100 amp PWM
but<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.730> he<00:04:17.820> couldn't<00:04:18.060> light<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.450> like

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
but that he couldn't light this up like

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.340 
but that he couldn't light this up like
a<00:04:18.660> Christmas<00:04:19.080> tree<00:04:20.299> he's<00:04:21.299> still<00:04:21.510> camp<00:04:21.750> that's

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
a Christmas tree he's still camp that's

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.170 
a Christmas tree he's still camp that's
the<00:04:22.500> point
