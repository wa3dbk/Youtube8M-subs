 from our ashes a sorcerer who tells me 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.910
 a magician who does magic to me but is in 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 the tea back in my goal is worth what 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.500
 valga feels cold sleep from the other 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 side of the bed hugging what's in 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.830
 you were pillow 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.490
 to think with a yellow card because 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.230
 I need the hours as a sign of 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.330
 sea ​​and the days I get longer I'm 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.729
 I think a million day is a week 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
 prince portal and I'm a frog the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.240
 which was not expected from their princesses nor 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 a kiss or a look 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.130
 if not these nations 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 You will feel the same if I have to say 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.310
 and if you're not there, there's no vacuum and nothing 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 it's the same 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.149
 and if that day did not stop crying and I have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.149
 what to say 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 leave you alone that was my fault thinking 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.380
 that a few days would erase so much damage 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.420
 being that says that I know that you lack the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.910
 respect but remember that in this world 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.870
 an opportunity for him to see that he loves you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.180
 the one that without you I am nothing, I was very 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.040
 blind now I feel anger I feel jealous 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.350
 when he saw you with another baby and I 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.090
 despair and see my bed without table 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.160
 I also miss you when someone 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 mentions is like a stab wow what 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.120

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.800

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.010
 damn past and my fear of another life 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.960
 He was a scoundrel I played with you now 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.080
 like the calm and forcing in the wind 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.600
 because you gave me bands 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.030
