working<00:00:01.140> on<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.410> old<00:00:01.589> Mustang<00:00:02.100> today<00:00:03.529> it

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
working on the old Mustang today it

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.380 
working on the old Mustang today it
changed<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> throttle<00:00:05.640> position<00:00:05.730> sensor<00:00:06.359> a

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
changed the throttle position sensor a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.370 
changed the throttle position sensor a
while<00:00:06.629> back<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:08.160> felt<00:00:08.340> like<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> car<00:00:08.849> lost

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
while back and it felt like the car lost

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.959 
while back and it felt like the car lost
probably<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> wrong<00:00:10.559> 25<00:00:11.040> horsepower<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.820> got

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
probably the wrong 25 horsepower it got

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.200 
probably the wrong 25 horsepower it got
real<00:00:12.150> sluggish<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.679> hole<00:00:14.059> what<00:00:15.059> this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
real sluggish out of the hole what this

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.019 
real sluggish out of the hole what this
is<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> low<00:00:15.809> voltage<00:00:16.190> potentiometer<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.910> it

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
is is a low voltage potentiometer and it

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
is is a low voltage potentiometer and it
tells<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> computer<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:18.900> position<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
tells the computer what position the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120 
tells the computer what position the
butterfly<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> throttle<00:00:20.910> body<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:22.130> it

butterfly and the throttle body is in it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.679 
butterfly and the throttle body is in it
also<00:00:23.369> helps<00:00:23.789> determine<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> fuel

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
also helps determine what the fuel

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.560 
also helps determine what the fuel
mixture<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.380> low<00:00:25.560> speeds<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:27.240> original

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
mixture is at low speeds the original

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.929 
mixture is at low speeds the original
ones<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.869> supposed<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.320> non<00:00:28.500> adjustable

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
ones are supposed to be non adjustable

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
ones are supposed to be non adjustable
but<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> take<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> file<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> dremel<00:00:32.430> tool

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
holes and follow the arc that you would

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
holes and follow the arc that you would
need<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> turn<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> device<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.280> throttle

need to turn the device on the throttle

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360 
need to turn the device on the throttle
body<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> adjustable<00:00:43.250> or<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
body you can make it adjustable or you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
body you can make it adjustable or you
could<00:00:44.520> buy<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.700> adjustable<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:46.140> gonna

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
could buy an adjustable one I'm gonna

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.500 
could buy an adjustable one I'm gonna
throw<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> voltmeter<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> mine<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:48.360> where

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
throw a voltmeter in mine and see where

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.270 
throw a voltmeter in mine and see where
it's<00:00:48.629> set<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.860> tweak<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.100> at

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's set at and see if I can tweak it at

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's set at and see if I can tweak it at
all<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.000> better

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
all to get a little bit better

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
all to get a little bit better
performance<00:00:51.920> you're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> need<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
performance you're going to need a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
performance you're going to need a
voltmeter<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.270> low<00:00:54.449> setting<00:00:54.899> I'm

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
voltmeter with a very low setting I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
voltmeter with a very low setting I'm
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> 2<00:00:55.770> volt<00:00:55.949> setting<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
going to use a 2 volt setting and this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
going to use a 2 volt setting and this
voltmeter<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.800> sticking<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> safety<00:00:59.969> pin

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
voltmeter I'll be sticking a safety pin

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
voltmeter I'll be sticking a safety pin
in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> green<00:01:00.570> wire<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.520> hooking<00:01:02.520> positive

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in the green wire and hooking positive

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
in the green wire and hooking positive
of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> voltmeter<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> safety<00:01:04.470> pen

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
of the voltmeter up to the safety pen

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
of the voltmeter up to the safety pen
and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> negative<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> ground<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and then the negative up to ground and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
and then the negative up to ground and
then<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> turn<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> key<00:01:08.100> forward<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> will

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
then when I turn the key forward I will

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.390 
then when I turn the key forward I will
see<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.330> set<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> here's<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.130> setup

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
see where it's set at so here's my setup

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.070 
see where it's set at so here's my setup
i<00:01:11.640> pierce<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> green<00:01:12.330> wire<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> safety

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
i pierce the green wire with the safety

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.940 
i pierce the green wire with the safety
pin<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.330> voltmeter<00:01:15.600> grounded<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.799> going

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
pin of my voltmeter grounded I'm going

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.109 
pin of my voltmeter grounded I'm going
to<00:01:17.009> turn<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> key<00:01:17.369> forward<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:17.970> where

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to turn the key forward and see where

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.789 
to turn the key forward and see where
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.299> set<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:24.140> looks<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> level<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
this is set at looks like it's level and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
this is set at looks like it's level and
offer<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:27.259> 0.99<00:01:28.259> zero<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
offer on 0.99 zero so I know that this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
offer on 0.99 zero so I know that this
really<00:01:31.290> isn't<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> ideal<00:01:31.829> setting<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
really isn't the ideal setting for this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.960 
really isn't the ideal setting for this
car<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> ahead<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.909> change<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
car so I'm gonna go ahead and change it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
car so I'm gonna go ahead and change it
up<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.750> happens<00:01:37.079> it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
up a little and see what happens it's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.520 
up a little and see what happens it's
stabilized<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> 0.98<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.650> gonna

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
stabilized to 0.98 so now I'm gonna

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.480 
stabilized to 0.98 so now I'm gonna
loosen<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:43.829> two<00:01:44.040> screws<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.340> can

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
loosen up these two screws and you can

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.550 
loosen up these two screws and you can
see<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.570> change<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.320> tweak<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
see there we can change as I tweak it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.660 
see there we can change as I tweak it
looks<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> whole<00:01:53.310> lot

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
looks like I don't have a whole lot

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.459 
looks like I don't have a whole lot
adjustment<00:01:54.390> into<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.200> don't<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
adjustment into this I don't have to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.069 
adjustment into this I don't have to
maybe<00:01:58.469> file<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> piece<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.460> more

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
maybe file the piece a little bit more

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.710 
maybe file the piece a little bit more
so<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.469> removed

like this piece was uh was made for this

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.320 
like this piece was uh was made for this
we'll<00:02:43.519> see<00:02:43.610> what<00:02:43.730> kind<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.910> voltage<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.299> can

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
we'll see what kind of voltage you can

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.390 
we'll see what kind of voltage you can
get<00:02:44.510> out<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:44.959> here<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.040> installed

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
get out of it now here it is installed

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.490 
get out of it now here it is installed
you<00:02:46.549> can<00:02:46.580> see<00:02:46.819> it<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.090> 1.45<00:02:47.720> volts<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
you can see it about 1.45 volts on the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.750 
you can see it about 1.45 volts on the
top<00:02:48.680> end<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.459> other<00:02:52.489> direction

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
top end and then on the other direction

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.309 
top end and then on the other direction
I<00:02:53.060> got<00:02:53.209> about<00:02:53.709> 0.85<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:56.810> probably<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.200> put

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
I got about 0.85 so I'm probably to put

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.710 
I got about 0.85 so I'm probably to put
this<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.860> about<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.340> point<00:02:58.489> one<00:02:58.580> volts<00:02:58.700> try<00:02:59.660> it

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
this at about one point one volts try it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.520 
this at about one point one volts try it
and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:01.870> continue<00:03:02.870> tweaking<00:03:03.080> from<00:03:03.349> there

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
and then continue tweaking from there

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.640 
and then continue tweaking from there
till<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> get<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.310> best<00:03:05.000> results<00:03:05.510> well<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.500> got

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
till I get the best results well I got

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.240 
till I get the best results well I got
up<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:06.980> operating<00:03:07.340> temperature<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:09.100> got<00:03:10.100> to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
up to operating temperature and I got to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.789 
up to operating temperature and I got to
see<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.880> put<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> tenth<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.079> volt<00:03:12.290> more<00:03:12.560> on

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
see it I put a tenth of a volt more on

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.840 
see it I put a tenth of a volt more on
it<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.190> difference<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.000> incredible<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:15.850> step

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
it and difference is incredible I step

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.940 
it and difference is incredible I step
on<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.390> first<00:03:17.870> scared<00:03:18.170> twenty<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.709> lean

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
on it and first scared twenty is lean

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.090 
on it and first scared twenty is lean
rubber<00:03:19.280> right

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.200 

10,000<00:03:22.760> here<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:24.680> there's<00:03:24.770> any<00:03:25.010> more

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
10,000 here and see if there's any more

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.620 
10,000 here and see if there's any more
difference

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.920 

times<00:03:30.290> change<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.770> reading<00:03:31.210> but<00:03:32.210> that's

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
times change the reading but that's

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.830 
times change the reading but that's
pretty<00:03:33.050> close

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
pretty close

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.970 
pretty close
simply<00:03:35.840> cumin<00:03:36.080> picked<00:03:36.260> up<00:03:36.380> some<00:03:36.590> more<00:03:36.710> there

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
simply cumin picked up some more there

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.700 
simply cumin picked up some more there
it<00:03:37.220> actually<00:03:38.120> got<00:03:38.180> sideways<00:03:38.690> at<00:03:38.960> time<00:03:39.260> and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
it actually got sideways at time and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.380 
it actually got sideways at time and
stuff<00:03:39.950> down<00:03:40.130> in<00:03:40.190> first<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.730> 20<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:43.210> all<00:03:44.210> the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
stuff down in first a 20 and all the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.300 
stuff down in first a 20 and all the
hesitation<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:45.170> gone<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.660> pin

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.240 

so<00:03:51.880> let<00:03:52.000> me<00:03:52.030> try<00:03:52.270> another<00:03:52.450> tenth<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.250> we'll

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
so let me try another tenth and we'll

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.490 
so let me try another tenth and we'll
see<00:03:54.400> what<00:03:54.520> happens<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.120> here's<00:03:56.110> what<00:03:56.290> another

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
see what happens so here's what another

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.930 
see what happens so here's what another
tenth<00:03:58.260> we'll<00:03:59.260> give<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.530> shot<00:03:59.710> if<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.670> can't

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
tenth we'll give it a shot if you can't

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:11.110 
tenth we'll give it a shot if you can't
talk<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.330> film<00:04:01.570> but<00:04:02.040> promotable<00:04:03.040> 20

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.479 

got<00:04:11.510> some<00:04:11.690> wheel<00:04:11.870> spin

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
got some wheel spin

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.580 
got some wheel spin
well<00:04:13.909> it<00:04:14.000> seems<00:04:14.269> before<00:04:14.659> a<00:04:14.689> little<00:04:15.140> bit<00:04:15.319> worse

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
well it seems before a little bit worse

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.840 
well it seems before a little bit worse
I<00:04:16.329> try<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.389> back<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.870> offload

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
I try to back and offload

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.170 
I try to back and offload
one<00:04:20.600> more<00:04:20.750> shot<00:04:20.980> Eric<00:04:21.980> just<00:04:22.190> up<00:04:22.490> again<00:04:22.760> here<00:04:23.090> we

one more shot Eric just up again here we

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.360 
one more shot Eric just up again here we

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
all right I got her back at 1.18 and

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.670 
all right I got her back at 1.18 and
seems<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.750> there<00:04:32.990> take<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.620> the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
seems to like it there take it on the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.360 
seems to like it there take it on the
fly<00:04:33.890> away<00:04:34.130> see<00:04:34.790> how<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.030> goes<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:36.190> feels<00:04:37.190> good

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
fly away see how it goes and feels good

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.250 
fly away see how it goes and feels good
I'm<00:04:37.520> gonna<00:04:37.640> leave<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.880> there<00:04:37.930> really<00:04:38.930> without

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
I'm gonna leave it there really without

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.900 
I'm gonna leave it there really without

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.770 
is kind of like spitting in the wind but
it's<00:04:45.290> definitely<00:04:45.680> much<00:04:45.830> better<00:04:46.100> than<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.400> was

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
it's definitely much better than it was

it's definitely much better than it was

suggested<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.610> setting<00:04:52.940> gets<00:04:53.120> affected

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
suggested that the setting gets affected

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.730 
suggested that the setting gets affected
anytime<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.930> change<00:04:53.960> anything<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
anytime you change anything in the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.220 
anytime you change anything in the
engine<00:04:55.070> like<00:04:55.340> fuel<00:04:56.030> pressure<00:04:56.360> or<00:04:56.810> injector

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
engine like fuel pressure or injector

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.370 
engine like fuel pressure or injector
size<00:04:57.440> or<00:04:57.920> cam<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.900> you're<00:05:00.050> supposed<00:05:00.230> to

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
size or cam so you're supposed to

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.770 
size or cam so you're supposed to
revisit<00:05:01.010> this<00:05:01.340> setting<00:05:01.730> now<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.510> got<00:05:02.660> my

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.840 
revisit this setting now that I got my
Mustang<00:05:02.990> running<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.530> way<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:04.190> wanted<00:05:04.640> to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.100 
Mustang running the way I wanted to
I<00:05:04.970> should<00:05:05.180> probably<00:05:05.270> take<00:05:05.540> some<00:05:05.720> time<00:05:05.930> and
