00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
but the bottom part it seems that he's

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.360 
but the bottom part it seems that he's
having<00:03:31.419> too<00:03:31.569> little<00:03:31.650> fitting<00:03:32.650> problems<00:03:33.129> right

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370

you'll be able to see but this side of

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.210 
you'll be able to see but this side of
the<00:03:45.129> case<00:03:45.430> was<00:03:45.699> kind<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.090> popping<00:03:46.329> open<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.220> it

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the case was kind of popping open and it

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.890 
the case was kind of popping open and it

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
well so that's something that I was

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.879 
well so that's something that I was
really<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.479> little<00:03:52.690> disappointed<00:03:53.379> of<00:03:53.530> this

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
really a little disappointed of this

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.819 
really a little disappointed of this
