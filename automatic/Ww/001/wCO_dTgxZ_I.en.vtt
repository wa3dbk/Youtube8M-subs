like what it looks like the very end of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.869 
like what it looks like the very end of
the<00:00:56.520> day<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.809> um<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> washed<00:00:59.730> my

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the day so I just um I just washed my

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.020 
the day so I just um I just washed my
hair<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.469> damp<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.820> can

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
hair so it's a little damp and you can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.250 
hair so it's a little damp and you can
use<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:04.040> dry<00:01:05.040> hair<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
use this on dry hair but I think that it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.490 
use this on dry hair but I think that it
might<00:01:07.500> work<00:01:07.619> best<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.430> hair's<00:01:08.640> wet<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.500> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
might work best if your hair's wet and I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.160 
might work best if your hair's wet and I
let<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> air<00:01:11.520> dry<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.659> add<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
let it air dry a little bit and I add it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
let it air dry a little bit and I add it
in<00:01:13.439> horrible<00:01:14.369> add<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:15.630> leave-in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in horrible add some leave-in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.179 
in horrible add some leave-in
conditioner<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.250> don't<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:19.189> my

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
conditioner just because I don't want my

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.420

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.320 
the best out of all that I've tried I'm
just<00:02:26.750> gonna<00:02:26.959> scratch<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.709> hair<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
just gonna scratch the hair a bit to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.479 
just gonna scratch the hair a bit to
provide<00:02:29.660> some<00:02:30.230> waves<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:30.830> these

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
provide some waves because these

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.680 
provide some waves because these
extensions<00:02:32.150> are<00:02:34.239> straight<00:02:35.239> they're<00:02:35.600> not<00:02:35.780> wavy

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
extensions are straight they're not wavy

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.309 
extensions are straight they're not wavy
like<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.810> usually<00:02:39.519> get<00:02:40.519> on<00:02:40.670> my<00:02:40.790> hair

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.380 

I<00:02:47.409> wanted<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.219> try<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.549> style<00:02:48.939> because<00:02:49.209> it's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
I wanted to try the style because it's

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.119 
I wanted to try the style because it's
really<00:02:50.049> um<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:52.239> casual<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.859> looks<00:02:54.010> like

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
really um it's casual but it looks like

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.940 
really um it's casual but it looks like
a<00:02:54.280> very<00:02:54.459> minimal<00:02:55.030> effort<00:02:55.480> went<00:02:55.689> into<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.170> even

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
a very minimal effort went into it even

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
a very minimal effort went into it even
though<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.700> mean<00:02:57.939> I<00:02:58.030> have<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.269> wash<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:58.719> hair

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
though I mean I have to wash my hair

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.140 
though I mean I have to wash my hair
that<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.889> to<00:02:59.980> sit<00:03:00.189> here<00:03:00.219> and<00:03:00.519> do<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.120> I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that I have to sit here and do this so I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
that I have to sit here and do this so I
mean<00:03:01.269> that<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.569> kind<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.200> an<00:03:02.290> effort<00:03:02.409> but

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
mean that is kind of an effort but

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.160 
mean that is kind of an effort but
somehow<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.810> still<00:03:05.079> easier<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.079> know

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
somehow it's still easier then you know

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
somehow it's still easier then you know
washing<00:03:08.409> my<00:03:08.590> hair<00:03:08.739> blow<00:03:09.010> drying<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.519> out

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.819 
and then flutter and a flat ironing it
straight<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.840> feel<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.169> this<00:03:18.540> little

because<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:47.199> am<00:04:47.680> wearing<00:04:47.919> extensions<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.860> it

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
because I am wearing extensions so it

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.510 
because I am wearing extensions so it
really<00:04:51.340> helps<00:04:51.820> if<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.800> foundation<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.370> my

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
really helps if the foundation of my

00:04:54.520 --> 00:06:03.690 
really helps if the foundation of my
hair<00:04:54.669> dry<00:04:54.940> because<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.180> have<00:04:55.419> sewn

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.960 

so<00:06:04.700> I<00:06:04.730> used<00:06:05.030> my<00:06:05.290> wedgie<00:06:06.290> HD<00:06:06.620> on<00:06:07.610> medium<00:06:07.970> heat

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
so I used my wedgie HD on medium heat

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.580 
so I used my wedgie HD on medium heat
because<00:06:10.970> I<00:06:11.090> am<00:06:11.240> trying<00:06:11.600> to<00:06:11.840> dry<00:06:12.080> the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
because I am trying to dry the

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.790 
because I am trying to dry the
foundation<00:06:13.130> of<00:06:13.220> my<00:06:13.370> extensions<00:06:14.260> if<00:06:15.260> you<00:06:15.560> don't

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
foundation of my extensions if you don't

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.260 
foundation of my extensions if you don't
wear<00:06:16.010> extensions<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.700> might<00:06:16.850> just<00:06:17.000> want<00:06:17.240> to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
wear extensions you might just want to

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.170 
wear extensions you might just want to
use<00:06:17.510> a<00:06:17.810> low<00:06:18.200> heat<00:06:18.590> on<00:06:19.150> this<00:06:20.150> style<00:06:22.150> so<00:06:23.150> I

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
use a low heat on this style so I

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.880 
use a low heat on this style so I
continue<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.900> scrunch<00:06:24.230> just<00:06:24.590> because<00:06:24.800> I

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
continue to scrunch just because I

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.180 
continue to scrunch just because I
really<00:06:25.430> want<00:06:25.700> my<00:06:26.360> hair<00:06:26.600> to<00:06:26.750> look<00:06:26.840> like<00:06:27.190> messy

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.200 

so<00:06:41.660> it's<00:06:42.080> going<00:06:42.350> to<00:06:42.440> dry<00:06:42.680> really<00:06:43.370> pretty<00:06:43.790> cool

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
so it's going to dry really pretty cool

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:51.520 
so it's going to dry really pretty cool
I<00:06:47.440> love<00:06:48.440> messy<00:06:48.890> styles<00:06:49.400> just<00:06:49.760> because<00:06:50.000> I<00:06:50.530> can
