actually seen it yet whose idea I like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.560 
actually seen it yet whose idea I like
anything<00:01:07.610> okay<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
anything okay use you have to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
anything okay use you have to
incorporate<00:01:09.860> at<00:01:10.860> least<00:01:10.979> three<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.610> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
incorporate at least three of these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:32.540 
incorporate at least three of these
poles<00:01:12.350> yes<00:01:13.490> okay

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.590 

yeah<00:01:33.550> how<00:01:34.180> would<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.600> win<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.350> certain<00:01:35.770> game

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.210 

and<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:41.050> think<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.320> helps<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:41.890> it's<00:01:42.160> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
and I think it helps to that it's a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:52.470 
and I think it helps to that it's a
slippery<00:01:42.640> floor<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.700> clearly<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.180> was<00:01:52.450> a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
slippery floor so clearly that was a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.410 
slippery floor so clearly that was a
