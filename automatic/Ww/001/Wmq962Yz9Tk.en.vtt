00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Do you remember that video of the guy who 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 lost his love in the ballad 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 the crowd got angry as she discovered 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.650
 that was a viral of nokia to divulge 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.099
 the new device so the device in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.230
 question is this is the 9 808 and saw it soon 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 guy he already calls attention to the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 size and weight slightly higher than the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.260
 current devices but still it is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 well anatomical 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.699
 it is made of durable plastic and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 screen has gorilla technology for 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.279
 protect from scratches 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 it has micro usb and micro hdmi output 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.510
 but the hdmi cable does not come alongside the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.149
 4 inches amoled has 360 by 640 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 points which is enough to watch 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.370
 videos or play with good quality 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 the symbian installed system and much 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 people can twist their noses but they 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.809
 made some modifications that the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.250
 they left the cell phone bill very intuitive 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 with a 1.3 ghz arm11 processor and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.070
 512 MB of memory and the ing is fine 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.500
 fast with this setting the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.780
 applications run well in the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 screens are fluid it is possible to organize 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 the icons in column or in order 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 alphabetical 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.700
 remembering windows phone and other 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 functions were inspired by android as 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.030
 this curtain to access some 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.009
 settings 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.040
 The problem with it is that many applications 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.140
 not available but for those who do not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.909
 ties the main 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 applications are present 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 now what everyone wants to know about 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 41 megapixel supercross camera works 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 even so it works very well 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.939
 thanks to the development of the sensor and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.250
 besides causing this if you want to know 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.380
 more technical details click the link in the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.170
 video description actually 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 the camera does not take pictures with 41 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
 megapixels 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.689
 the sensor even has this size but due 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 edge losses 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.310
 the photos are 34 megapixels in the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 proportion burns and thirty-eight 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.170
 megapixels in the ratio of four per 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.719
 three but the photos are still 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.050
 great landscape photos capture details 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.090
 surprising and xenon flash helps and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.010
 we still have such technology peer review 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.370
 that takes photos with up to 1 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.590
 megapixels that how it works 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.290
 peer review technology takes advantage of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.780
 41 megapixel sensor for grouping 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 several peaks in only one forming a 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 denser image 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
 so the picture is clearer and sharper the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.269
 camera also makes full HD videos and is 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.579
 possible to use the flash for lighting 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.280
 we have several adjustment options for 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.159
 various environments, which makes the camera 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.590
 versatile and it is still possible to edit the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.689
 photo before share remember side 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.459
 viral video where the guy zooms in on 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.010
 photo to read the phone on the ticket 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.799
 so that may have been a little 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.209
 exaggerated but the photos really do 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.340
 with incredible detail 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.060
 the device still has technology 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.680
 nfc that of the single ticket and the gps 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.349
 it has an advantage over the other 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.900
 because you do not need to be connected to 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.920
 work just download the map for free 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.139
 in the nokia store 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.239
 his battery also surprised in the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.659
 our pattern she held two 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.190
 days a brand practically 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.470
 impossible the current smartphones 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.359
 here in the video description we have a link 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.760
 for complete review including the 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.290
 price and we also have a link to 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.129
 an album of photos taken with the camera 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.169
 his 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.069
 If you have any doubt, leave us here. 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.549
