00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.069 
started and how I got to making them so
just<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> show<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:37.050> I

just to do that I have to show you how I
began<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.030> if<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> look<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
began and if you look right here this is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 
began and if you look right here this is
the<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.460> cruise<00:00:41.790> ship<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.180> made

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the very first cruise ship that I made

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.830 
the very first cruise ship that I made
as<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.489> too<00:00:44.550> big<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.360> mean

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
as you can see it's not too big I mean

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.740 
as you can see it's not too big I mean
it's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> pretty<00:00:46.200> good<00:00:46.410> size<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.280> one

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
it's a pretty good size for a first one

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.860 
it's a pretty good size for a first one
but<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> look<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.149> it's<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.420> wide

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
but if you look at it it's not very wide

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.680 
but if you look at it it's not very wide
at<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:53.129> definitely<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.210> wide<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.570> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
at all it's definitely not wide at all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
at all it's definitely not wide at all
and<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> realized<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.820> had<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and that's when I realized that I had to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
and that's when I realized that I had to
make<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> new<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.800> realized<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
make a new one because I realized that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
make a new one because I realized that
this<00:01:00.030> wasn't<00:01:00.300> wide<00:01:00.539> enough<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.739> wasn't

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
this wasn't wide enough and it wasn't

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.640 
this wasn't wide enough and it wasn't
big<00:01:02.520> enough<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.600> once<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> wanted<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> go

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
big enough and I once I wanted to go

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
big enough and I once I wanted to go
bigger<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> better<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.069 
maybe 200 blocks long if that I've
encountered<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.399> while<00:01:50.780> but<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> still

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
encountered it in a while but it's still

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.450 
encountered it in a while but it's still
one<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.320> my<00:01:52.380> favorite<00:01:52.680> builds<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> looks

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
one of my favorite builds it looks

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
one of my favorite builds it looks
amazing<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.210> looks<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> cruise

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
amazing it looks actually like a cruise

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 
amazing it looks actually like a cruise
ship<00:01:55.640> ah

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
ship ah

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.880 
ship ah
but<00:01:57.479> again<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> felt<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.500> could<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.740> better

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
but again I felt like I could do better

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.270 
but again I felt like I could do better
so<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.880> at<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.149> cruise<00:02:00.420> ship<00:02:01.280> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so if you look at this cruise ship this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.499 
so if you look at this cruise ship this
thing<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.549> massive<00:02:04.579> if<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:06.329> you're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
thing is massive if you if you're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
thing is massive if you if you're
wondering<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:06.810> about<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.560> cyan<00:02:07.950> wool

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
wondering about about the cyan wool

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.719 
wondering about about the cyan wool
right<00:02:08.340> there

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
right there

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
right there
it's<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.470> reason<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.890> stopped

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it's because the reason I stopped

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.630 
it's because the reason I stopped
working<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.640> one

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
working on this one

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
working on this one
it's<00:02:13.210> because<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.900> colors<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.290> too

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's because one the colors are too

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's because one the colors are too
harsh<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> eyes<00:02:15.070> mean<00:02:16.060> there's<00:02:16.420> there's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
harsh on the eyes mean there's there's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.220 
harsh on the eyes mean there's there's
this<00:02:17.500> too<00:02:17.740> much<00:02:17.890> orange<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.520> I'm<00:02:19.420> not<00:02:20.020> really

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
this too much orange and I'm not really

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.740 
this too much orange and I'm not really
a<00:02:20.320> big<00:02:20.500> fan<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> orange<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:22.480> kind<00:02:22.690> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
a big fan of the orange and I kind of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.350 
a big fan of the orange and I kind of
messed<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.260> uh<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.970> can't<00:02:25.180> add

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
messed up on it uh because I can't add

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.110 
messed up on it uh because I can't add
my<00:02:25.540> smokestacks<00:02:26.170> because<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.640> almost

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
my smokestacks because this is almost

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.630 
my smokestacks because this is almost
the<00:02:28.360> very<00:02:28.570> sky<00:02:29.050> limit<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.680> coming<00:02:30.100> up<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.460> much

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the very sky limit I coming up that much

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.510 
the very sky limit I coming up that much
more<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.650> kind<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> figured<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.280> messed

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
more and so I kind of figured I messed

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.630 
more and so I kind of figured I messed
up<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.830> went<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.190> go<00:02:36.310> work<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:36.550> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
up on it and so I went to go work on a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.760 
up on it and so I went to go work on a
new<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.660> honestly<00:02:38.290> nobody's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
new one and that honestly nobody's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.540 
new one and that honestly nobody's
really<00:02:38.950> seen<00:02:39.220> only<00:02:40.710> only<00:02:41.710> one<00:02:42.070> person<00:02:42.430> has

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
really seen only only one person has

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.930 
really seen only only one person has
helped<00:02:42.700> me<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:42.820> with<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:44.550> he<00:02:45.550> owe<00:02:45.610> me<00:02:45.730> help

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
helped me out with it and he owe me help

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.130 
helped me out with it and he owe me help
me<00:02:46.000> out<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> little<00:02:46.270> bit<00:02:46.390> obviously<00:02:46.930> you've

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
me out a little bit obviously you've

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.040 
me out a little bit obviously you've
been<00:02:47.170> making<00:02:47.620> all<00:02:47.770> of<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.980> by<00:02:48.250> myself<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.050> I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
been making all of it by myself and I

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.990 
been making all of it by myself and I
figured<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.620> was<00:02:50.680> time<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.860> reveal<00:02:51.070> how<00:02:51.820> it's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
figured it was time to reveal how it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.230 
figured it was time to reveal how it's
coming<00:02:52.180> along<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.050> guys<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:54.240> so

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
coming along and to you guys think so

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.390 
coming along and to you guys think so
imagine<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.140> thing<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.280> think

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
imagine this one this thing is I think

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.730 
imagine this one this thing is I think
four<00:02:57.880> hundred<00:02:58.150> blocks<00:02:58.360> long<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:59.470> entire

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
four hundred blocks long this entire

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.790 
four hundred blocks long this entire
cruise<00:03:00.040> ship<00:03:00.190> right<00:03:00.910> here<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:02.140> it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
cruise ship right here and then it's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
cruise ship right here and then it's
going<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> map<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.400> if<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:06.730> right

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
going to map out if I have one all right

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.280 
going to map out if I have one all right
so<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.120> how<00:03:07.300> big<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.690> cruise<00:03:07.959> ship<00:03:08.110> is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
so that's how big this cruise ship is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.440 
so that's how big this cruise ship is
just<00:03:08.800> keep<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.130> mind<00:03:09.220> now<00:03:10.209> we're<00:03:10.360> gonna

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
just keep that in mind now we're gonna

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.570 
just keep that in mind now we're gonna
go<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.200> most<00:03:11.410> recent<00:03:11.770> cruise<00:03:12.340> ship<00:03:12.550> that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
go to the most recent cruise ship that

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.170 
go to the most recent cruise ship that
I've<00:03:12.790> been<00:03:12.880> working<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:14.190> alright<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.850> is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
I've been working on alright so this is

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.240 
I've been working on alright so this is
my<00:03:16.209> most<00:03:16.720> recent<00:03:16.870> cruise<00:03:17.230> ship<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.040> said

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
my most recent cruise ship like I said

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.710 
my most recent cruise ship like I said
I've<00:03:18.459> been<00:03:18.489> making<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:18.940> basically<00:03:19.360> all<00:03:19.600> by

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
I've been making this basically all by

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.100 
I've been making this basically all by
myself<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:21.100> been<00:03:21.250> taking<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.640> while<00:03:21.880> uh<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
myself so it's been taking a while uh I

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.810 
myself so it's been taking a while uh I
think<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:23.680> taken<00:03:23.860> me<00:03:23.980> two<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.370> three<00:03:24.519> weeks

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
think it's taken me two or three weeks

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.940 
think it's taken me two or three weeks
you<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.090> make<00:03:25.209> all<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.800> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you can make all this so this is the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.130 
you can make all this so this is the
back<00:03:27.100> end<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> ship<00:03:27.640> as<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.690> can<00:03:28.810> see<00:03:28.959> it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
back end of the ship as you can see it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.479 
back end of the ship as you can see it
so<00:03:29.350> it's<00:03:29.650> pretty<00:03:30.010> big

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
so it's pretty big

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.300 
so it's pretty big
right<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.570> have<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:32.080> little<00:03:32.530> theater<00:03:32.890> or

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
right here you have a little theater or

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
right here you have a little theater or
a<00:03:33.340> stage<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.600> performances<00:03:35.610> right<00:03:36.610> here<00:03:37.150> are

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
a stage for performances right here are

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.560 
a stage for performances right here are
some<00:03:38.050> rooms<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.060> actually<00:03:40.390> going<00:03:40.480> to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
some rooms and this is actually going to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.560 
some rooms and this is actually going to
be<00:03:40.630> open<00:03:41.019> right<00:03:41.620> here<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.269> then<00:03:43.269> up<00:03:43.540> here

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
be open right here and then up here

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.570 
be open right here and then up here
there's<00:03:44.110> going<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.890> tennis<00:03:45.340> and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
there's going to be like tennis and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.540 
there's going to be like tennis and
basketball<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.150> stuff<00:03:46.570> like<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.080> so<00:03:47.550> then

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
basketball and stuff like that so then

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.180 
basketball and stuff like that so then
let's<00:03:48.850> fly<00:03:49.830> down<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.160> other<00:03:51.340> end<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:54.010> you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
let's fly down to the other end and you

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.160 
let's fly down to the other end and you
can<00:03:54.310> see<00:03:54.519> we<00:03:55.239> still<00:03:55.480> can't<00:03:55.690> see<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.840> front<00:03:55.989> of

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
can see we still can't see the front of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.110 
can see we still can't see the front of
the<00:03:56.230> ship<00:03:57.420> up<00:03:58.420> there's<00:03:58.780> some<00:03:58.989> rooms<00:03:59.260> and<00:04:00.120> this

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
the ship up there's some rooms and this

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.370 
the ship up there's some rooms and this
cruise<00:04:01.360> ship<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.600> actually<00:04:01.870> more<00:04:02.050> realistic

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
cruise ship is actually more realistic

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.290 
cruise ship is actually more realistic
than<00:04:02.769> all<00:04:02.890> my<00:04:03.010> other<00:04:03.040> ones<00:04:03.430> especially<00:04:03.850> by<00:04:04.239> the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
than all my other ones especially by the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.360 
than all my other ones especially by the
front<00:04:04.570> end<00:04:04.810> because<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.590> front<00:04:05.800> end<00:04:05.950> actually

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
front end because the front end actually

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.009 
front end because the front end actually
try<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.610> make<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.970> more<00:04:07.209> look<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.690> cruise

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
try to make it more look like a cruise

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.080 
try to make it more look like a cruise
ship<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.070> think<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.370> succeeded<00:04:09.430> with<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
ship and I think I succeeded with that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.090 
ship and I think I succeeded with that
because<00:04:11.019> you<00:04:11.260> can<00:04:11.380> actually<00:04:11.470> see<00:04:11.830> where<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
because you can actually see where the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.170 
because you can actually see where the
bow<00:04:12.340> ah

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
bow ah

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.420 
bow ah
is<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.320> battle<00:04:14.560> or<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.860> captain's<00:04:15.250> deck

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
is it the battle or the captain's deck

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.719 
is it the battle or the captain's deck
I'm<00:04:15.640> not<00:04:15.850> really<00:04:16.000> sure<00:04:16.950> what<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.100> called<00:04:18.160> but

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
I'm not really sure what it's called but

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.490 
I'm not really sure what it's called but
you<00:04:18.790> can<00:04:19.000> see<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.870> can<00:04:20.019> actually<00:04:20.260> see

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
you can see that you can actually see

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.290 
you can see that you can actually see
where<00:04:21.190> everything<00:04:21.520> is<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.850> looks<00:04:22.090> more

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
where everything is it looks more

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.730 
where everything is it looks more
realistic<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:22.990> actually<00:04:23.289> go<00:04:23.380> into<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
realistic you can actually go into the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.450 
realistic you can actually go into the
front<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.100> ship

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
front of the ship

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.060 
front of the ship
and<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:25.449> figured<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.320> would<00:04:26.500> look<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.710> lot<00:04:26.830> better

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and I figured it would look a lot better

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.570 
and I figured it would look a lot better
if<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.250> made<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.490> more<00:04:27.729> realistic<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:30.009> I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
if I made it more realistic and and I

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.640 
if I made it more realistic and and I
didn't<00:04:31.030> mention<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.330> on<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.570> other<00:04:31.690> one<00:04:31.900> but

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
didn't mention this on the other one but

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.680 
didn't mention this on the other one but
with<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.520> orange<00:04:33.820> cruise<00:04:34.030> ship<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.389> was<00:04:34.509> too

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
with the orange cruise ship it was too

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.689 
with the orange cruise ship it was too
top-heavy<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:36.039> if<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.490> don't<00:04:36.580> know

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
top-heavy and that if you don't know

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.879 
top-heavy and that if you don't know
that<00:04:36.850> means<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.930> bottom<00:04:38.229> part<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.680> ship

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
that means the bottom part of the ship

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.710 
that means the bottom part of the ship
so<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.759> part<00:04:40.120> let<00:04:40.780> me<00:04:40.840> go<00:04:40.960> back<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.320> front

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
so this part let me go back to the front

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.890 
so this part let me go back to the front
do<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:43.960> do<00:04:45.330> okay<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:46.389> if<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.630> go<00:04:46.690> back<00:04:46.810> to

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
do you do do okay so if you go back to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.689 
do you do do okay so if you go back to
the<00:04:47.020> front<00:04:47.199> you<00:04:47.380> see<00:04:47.530> how<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:48.310> front<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.639> the

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
the front you see how the front of the

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.570 
the front you see how the front of the
ship<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.419> tall<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:51.100> see<00:04:51.250> how<00:04:51.400> many

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
ship it's this tall and you see how many

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
ship it's this tall and you see how many
floors<00:04:51.820> there<00:04:52.030> are<00:04:52.199> well<00:04:53.199> it<00:04:53.470> was<00:04:53.650> too

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
floors there are well it was too

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.310 
floors there are well it was too
top-heavy<00:04:54.160> which<00:04:54.580> means<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.139> bottom

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
top-heavy which means that the bottom

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.870 
top-heavy which means that the bottom
was<00:04:56.590> too<00:04:56.770> small<00:04:57.039> compared<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.520> how<00:04:57.699> many

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
was too small compared to how many

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.999 
was too small compared to how many
floors<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.360> were<00:04:58.509> on<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.870> top<00:04:59.110> and<00:04:59.380> so<00:04:59.979> I

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
floors that were on the top and so I

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.290 
floors that were on the top and so I
remade<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.699> and<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.660> made<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:01.900> bigger<00:05:02.110> one<00:05:02.349> ah

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
remade it and I made a bigger one ah

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.060 
remade it and I made a bigger one ah
this<00:05:04.300> thing<00:05:04.539> is<00:05:04.690> actually<00:05:05.550> 7<00:05:07.560> take<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.650> as<00:05:08.889> a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
this thing is actually 7 take it as a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.510 
this thing is actually 7 take it as a
round<00:05:09.400> 700<00:05:10.180> blocks<00:05:10.360> long<00:05:10.599> and<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:12.370> this

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
round 700 blocks long and so this

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.589 
round 700 blocks long and so this
thing's<00:05:12.759> massive

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
thing's massive

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.779 
thing's massive
it's<00:05:14.560> almost<00:05:14.949> double<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.280> size<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.580> other

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
it's almost double the size of the other

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.390 
it's almost double the size of the other
one<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.680> let's<00:05:18.160> get<00:05:18.639> out<00:05:18.759> a<00:05:18.789> map<00:05:20.190> then<00:05:21.190> you<00:05:21.280> can

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
one so let's get out a map then you can

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.290 
one so let's get out a map then you can
see<00:05:21.490> how<00:05:21.580> big<00:05:21.729> it<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.919> starts<00:05:24.280> from<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
see how big it is so it starts from the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.420 
see how big it is so it starts from the
left<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:25.870> can<00:05:26.710> see<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:26.949> front<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.280> ship

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
left you can see the front of the ship

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.460 
left you can see the front of the ship
over<00:05:27.610> there<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:28.360> then<00:05:28.510> where<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.050> am<00:05:29.229> right<00:05:29.409> now

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
over there and then where I am right now

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.800 
over there and then where I am right now
on<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.010> map<00:05:30.159> where<00:05:30.849> I'm<00:05:30.940> spinning<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.690> can

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
on the map where I'm spinning you can

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.680 
on the map where I'm spinning you can
see<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.050> back<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.440> ship<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:33.389> so<00:05:34.389> this

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
see the back of the ship and so this

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.140 
see the back of the ship and so this
thing<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:34.990> huge<00:05:35.380> it's<00:05:36.039> been<00:05:36.250> taken<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.729> you

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
thing is huge it's been taken and you

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.279 
thing is huge it's been taken and you
got<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.389> remember<00:05:37.510> I've<00:05:37.750> been<00:05:37.870> doing<00:05:38.050> this<00:05:38.110> all

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
got to remember I've been doing this all

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.230 
got to remember I've been doing this all
by<00:05:38.380> myself<00:05:38.409> so<00:05:39.310> none<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.760> floors<00:05:40.000> are<00:05:40.210> done

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
by myself so none of the floors are done

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.200 
by myself so none of the floors are done
ah<00:05:40.659> I<00:05:41.620> still<00:05:41.860> been<00:05:42.340> working<00:05:42.610> on<00:05:42.729> some<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.150> the

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
ah I still been working on some of the

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.300 
ah I still been working on some of the
rooms<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:43.780> what<00:05:44.560> I'm<00:05:44.650> actually<00:05:44.740> going<00:05:44.949> to<00:05:45.190> do

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
rooms and what I'm actually going to do

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.760 
rooms and what I'm actually going to do
is<00:05:45.580> make<00:05:46.120> one<00:05:46.150> side<00:05:46.599> of<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.810> ship<00:05:47.020> first

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
is make one side of the ship first

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.070 
is make one side of the ship first
because<00:05:48.520> if<00:05:48.639> you<00:05:48.729> look<00:05:48.909> this<00:05:49.419> side<00:05:49.599> it<00:05:49.750> hasn't

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
because if you look this side it hasn't

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.409 
because if you look this side it hasn't
even<00:05:50.169> been<00:05:50.349> started<00:05:50.770> yet<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:51.130> then<00:05:52.000> I'm<00:05:52.330> going

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
even been started yet and then I'm going

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.749 
even been started yet and then I'm going
to<00:05:52.510> be<00:05:53.080> recording<00:05:53.650> on<00:05:53.740> how<00:05:53.919> to<00:05:53.979> make<00:05:54.220> that<00:05:54.430> side

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
to be recording on how to make that side

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.149 
to be recording on how to make that side
and<00:05:55.139> so<00:05:56.139> you'll<00:05:56.320> be<00:05:56.440> able<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.650> see<00:05:56.740> step<00:05:57.039> by

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
and so you'll be able to see step by

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.820 
and so you'll be able to see step by
step<00:05:57.400> on<00:05:57.490> how<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.729> work<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.330> how<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:58.900> makes<00:05:59.259> the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
step on how I work and how I makes the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.399 
step on how I work and how I makes the
big<00:06:00.009> cruise<00:06:00.280> ships<00:06:00.460> like<00:06:00.669> this<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:02.320> is

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
big cruise ships like this and this is

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.129 
big cruise ships like this and this is
probably<00:06:02.530> my<00:06:02.710> biggest<00:06:02.919> project<00:06:03.490> yet<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.909> so<00:06:04.720> I

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
probably my biggest project yet and so I

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.649 
probably my biggest project yet and so I
figured<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:05.889> time<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.130> release<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:06.639> and<00:06:06.849> show

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
figured it's time to release it and show

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.810 
figured it's time to release it and show
you<00:06:07.690> guys<00:06:07.810> what<00:06:08.590> I've<00:06:08.680> been<00:06:08.800> up<00:06:08.949> to<00:06:08.979> been
