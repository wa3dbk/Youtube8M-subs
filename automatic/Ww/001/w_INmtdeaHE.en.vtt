00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the most part I played TDM and I do that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
the most part I played TDM and I do that
because<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.020> me<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> can't<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.070> handle<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because for me I can't really handle a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690 
because for me I can't really handle a
lot<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> vehicles<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.579> know

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
lot of the vehicles and and you know

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.680 
lot of the vehicles and and you know
when<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.149> especially<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.629> not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
when your especially when you're not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.850 
when your especially when you're not
playing<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> team<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.680> very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
playing with the team it's very

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
playing with the team it's very
difficult<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.250> play<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.640> conquest<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.300> rush

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
difficult to play like conquest and rush

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.369 
difficult to play like conquest and rush
because<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.539> annihilated
