00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
feel that my particular dog would know

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
feel that my particular dog would know
the<00:00:11.700> command<00:00:12.059> thoroughly<00:00:12.570> unless<00:00:13.380> he<00:00:13.559> could

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the command thoroughly unless he could

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
do these steps that's what I consider

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.150 
do these steps that's what I consider
basic<00:00:18.529> never<00:00:19.529> mind<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> screeching<00:00:20.520> car<00:00:22.160> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
basic never mind the screeching car so

basic never mind the screeching car so
the<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.519> step<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> can

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the first step is just that you can

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
the first step is just that you can
throw<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.289> object<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.250> dog<00:00:26.430> will<00:00:26.640> sit

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

the<00:00:43.290> people<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> aren't<00:00:43.860> familiar<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.460> our

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the people that aren't familiar with our

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.240 
the people that aren't familiar with our
training<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.270> say<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> dog<00:00:46.950> will

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
training let's say that the dog will

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
training let's say that the dog will
just<00:00:47.430> always<00:00:47.700> watch<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.899> worried<00:00:49.230> about

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just always watch and be worried about

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.270 
just always watch and be worried about
the<00:00:49.620> handler<00:00:50.039> watch<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> rest<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.570> video

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
the handler watch the rest of this video

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
the handler watch the rest of this video
the<00:00:53.280> next<00:00:53.610> step<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> throw<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the next step is that you can throw the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
the next step is that you can throw the
object<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.129> step<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.850> away<00:00:57.390> from

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
object out there and step out away from

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
object out there and step out away from
the<00:00:57.899> dog<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.829> normally<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.340> movement<00:01:00.030> would

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the dog now normally that movement would

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
the dog now normally that movement would
cause<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> dog<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
cause the dog to look at you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030 
cause the dog to look at you
but<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> command<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.899> him<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> watch<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
but the command is for him to watch that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.020 
but the command is for him to watch that
and<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:07.020> send<00:01:07.320> him<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.850> can

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of the command I stopped I send them

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.000 
of the command I stopped I send them
most<00:01:58.570> times<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.020> send<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.350> dog<00:01:59.560> from<00:01:59.860> your

side it'll usually get the dog all
confused<00:02:05.830> but<00:02:06.370> he<00:02:06.430> should<00:02:06.790> be<00:02:06.820> able<00:02:07.030> to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
confused but he should be able to

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.600 
confused but he should be able to
understand<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.960> from<00:02:08.530> any<00:02:08.740> angle<00:02:09.010> and<00:02:09.369> give

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.680 
understand that from any angle and give
him<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.119> thorough<00:02:10.450> understanding<00:02:12.690> this

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
him a more thorough understanding this

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.280

time<00:02:14.020> side<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.650> side<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.420> will<00:02:16.720> step<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
time side to side but I will step in a
