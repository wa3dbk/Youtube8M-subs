00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.120
 hello everyone I just wanted to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.699
 tell you for those who do not want 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 be spoiled to leave this video because 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.220
 that we will ask ourselves a little bit about this 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.590
 will happen in the next dlc 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.330
 here and for those who are curious low 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.739
 they were not staying with us in 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.600
 effect we will talk about the next 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.280
 missions of the next assaults 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.830
 upcoming contracts and events that 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.400
 are going to take place but also of the next 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.809
 raid 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.850
 so it's gone I start everything from 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.379
 following with the next missions of the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.839
 story mode and we will start with 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.970
 gone to grind which is a mission that 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.310
 will take place in the cosmodrome precisely 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.159
 on old russia and so this is a 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.290
 mission with level 32 enemies and 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.590
 it will beat in this mission 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.909
 pasquine who will be king beard and the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.580
 second mission called gold 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.670
 harvest so this mission will take place on 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.590
 Venus and the enemies will be level 3 2 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.950
 like all the missions this dlc is 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.390
 in this house it will kill lyxor 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 emission phase the terminus so that's 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.270
 currently what you see is 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.280
 unfold in the background of this video 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.290
 it's a video in which end it's 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 a common friend ormat in which I was 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.040
 already gone a long time ago already 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.810
 had put the video on our channel 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.250
 some may have already seen 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 if ever I give you the link in 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 comment below this video in 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.950
 the description in crete so it's a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.600
 mission in which he will have to kill the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.450
 king of wolves who will try to take 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 the control of the citadel vexes so 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.970
 it's the famous mission where we could 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 go up at the very top of the 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.320
 citadel for those who remember 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.150
 level 30 enemies from there again is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.190
 so it will happen on venus 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.720
 here we are now interested in 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.700
 next two to those who will be 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.590
 present so on the next dlc then 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.960
 the first one adjusts his name he 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 is called bang ward dragon so surely 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.480
 dragons of the vanguard 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.920
 this assault will be level 28 then 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 be careful with tweezers 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.520
 but I think it's this assault that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.490
 will be the exclusive playstation of the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.700
 next dlc 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.160
 okay so the next assault so this 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 will be the sketch caterer so here it is 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 simply a vessel from the chief of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 wolves so the ketch that will have to 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.280
 infiltrated to go and kill walker of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.070
 women is the famous main enemy of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.410
 this assault a level 28 assault that's going 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.490
 take place on the moon 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.920
 then the thing that everyone 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.900
 really waits this is the raid so he 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.310
 is called the queen this is a show will have 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.380
 place on the story then there it is 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.750
 really something that I can not wait to try 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.020
 which of course the reef 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.720
 we only saw one on one 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.620
 video not seen nobody nation did not have 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.680
 the opportunity to play on it 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.300
 so that the aso in normal version 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.080
 the enemies will be level 32 for the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.530
 hard version 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.390
 there will be level 34 and 35 limits 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.610
 so we will discover a new universe 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.650
 a new decor and it's especially for 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.390
 I think you're expecting a lot 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.070
 and of course since we're going 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.320
 to rise able to mount forgiveness 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.240
 up to level 34 and 35 so that's 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.350
 pretty cool 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.350
 so I do not know if you have 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.930
 noticed the names of those in this raid 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.930
 is called the queen so with a l 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.080
 apostrophe and strangely the contracts 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.270
 who are going to go out for this dlc 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.460
 these are the contracts that carry the same 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.260
 emblem that the queen's ire so we 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.780
 let's suppose it's not confirmed it's 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.850
 a guess that the event to read 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.380
 of the queen will come back so with all 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.970
 the weapons that we could taste at this moment 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.470
 there the purple sniper so I think it 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.120
 was called sovereignty if I did not 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.190
 not deceive there were other weapons 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.260
 nice enough the queen had come only one 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.820
 only one time it was quite tchit we had 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.440
 could quickly get our 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.970
 characters thanks to her so that I 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.630
 think it's going to be a little bit reviewed 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.700
 and corrected 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.340
 in any case if it is the case and well 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.410
 I think we will see the queen come back 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.000
 on the occasion of this event so I 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.480
 have to talk a bit about the three contracts in 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.210
 question 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.410
 so first of all I do not know if true 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.020
 clip to annoy the comments on 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 really do not know what will be kept 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.470
 rock one rose to read from the queen 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.000
 so it's really not at all 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.080
 case with regard to the contracts so 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.730
 there will surely be other contracts 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.740
 but that's three contracts that have a 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.200
 relationship with the bumps so he has the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.690
 first contract in which he 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 kill pasquine so it's a baron it's 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.510
 the boss 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.220
 the mission gone to grind in the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.790
 second contract it will kill lyxor 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.990
 who is the blade of the wolf this is what 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.680
 character there is really the mission 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.470
 or world 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.050
 harvest is in the third contract it 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 can kill schoolboy so that's him 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.140
 is in the mission to finish 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.970
 this show that you see on the screen 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.790
 So here are two missions at the end of 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.910
 contract to be executed on venus and 1 sedan 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.290
 the cosmodrome we hope we were not 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.370
 not too spoiler because I know he 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.900
 are people who do not really like that 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.880
 but hey we wanted to detail you a 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.140
 little bit we had the information 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.970
 tell us what you think about it say 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.560
 what missions do you prefer or 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.390
 she to callas to you can not wait 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.520
 to try here I think we all 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.710
 not really going on the reef it'll go 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.210
 that in my opinion there is no secret and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.560
 do not hesitate to share this video a 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.870
 maximum on social networks 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.800
 especially because I think there is 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.690
 many people who would like to have 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.400
 this information for the next dlc 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.860
 me anyway I really really 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.660
 I can not wait to test it all 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.710
 do very very big kisses and I will 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.810
 see you soon for others 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.440
 artists on destinies to him and 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.440
 good evening people
