thousand<00:01:52.350> million<00:01:52.590> power<00:01:52.799> battery<00:01:52.909> it's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
thousand million power battery it's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
thousand million power battery it's
quite<00:01:54.090> interesting<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.570> LG<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.500> say

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
