00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
their feet or out of position so we can

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
their feet or out of position so we can
drive<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> basket<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.040> works<00:00:35.250> best

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
drive to the basket now this works best

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
drive to the basket now this works best
because<00:00:35.579> he's<00:00:35.790> such<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> lethal<00:00:36.329> three-point

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
because he's such a lethal three-point

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600 
because he's such a lethal three-point
shooter<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.530> defenders<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.399> really

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
shooter that defenders are really really

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.979 
shooter that defenders are really really
jumpy<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> give<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
jumpy and don't want to give up that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.690 
jumpy and don't want to give up that
shot<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> great<00:00:41.219> move<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> you're

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
shot so this is a great move if you're

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
shot so this is a great move if you're
already<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.690> shooter<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
already really really good shooter but

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.389 
already really really good shooter but
you<00:00:43.290> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.770> sort<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.040> counter

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you want to have some sort of counter

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.770 
you want to have some sort of counter
that<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> paint<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that you can get to the paint way so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
that you can get to the paint way so
this<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> essentially<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> fake<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> one

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this is essentially just a fake and one

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
this is essentially just a fake and one
really<00:00:48.059> important<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.570> about<00:00:48.840> selling<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
really important thing about selling it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
really important thing about selling it
is<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.890> eye<00:00:49.920> check<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> step<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.940> pull

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
is your eye check out a step and pull

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
is your eye check out a step and pull
the<00:00:51.210> ball<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.420> he<00:00:52.020> finds<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> rim<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.739> his

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the ball back he finds the rim with his

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
the ball back he finds the rim with his
eyes<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.879> sells<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.420> makes<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
eyes and this really sells it makes the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.939 
eyes and this really sells it makes the
defender<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> he's<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> shoot

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
defender think that he's going to shoot

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
defender think that he's going to shoot
it<00:00:56.190> seems<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.670> simple<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.300> aspect

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
it seems really simple but this aspect

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
it seems really simple but this aspect
alone<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.920> move<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.370> alright<00:00:59.699> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
alone can make the move work alright so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.310 
alone can make the move work alright so
the<00:00:59.969> next<00:01:00.120> important<00:01:00.539> aspect<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> fake

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the next important aspect of the fake

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
the next important aspect of the fake
are<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> shoulders<00:01:02.100> look<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.699> his<00:01:02.789> eyes

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
are the shoulders look out when his eyes

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
are the shoulders look out when his eyes
go<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.270> his<00:01:03.780> shoulders<00:01:04.110> begin<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> raise<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
go up his shoulders begin to raise and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
go up his shoulders begin to raise and
if<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.129> freeze<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.790> looks<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.090> he's<00:01:06.210> going

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
if we freeze it it looks like he's going

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
if we freeze it it looks like he's going
directly<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.930> his<00:01:07.260> jump<00:01:07.590> shot<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
directly into his jump shot and that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.649 
directly into his jump shot and that
brings<00:01:08.430> us<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> last<00:01:08.820> point<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> that's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
brings us to the last point and that's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
brings us to the last point and that's
the<00:01:09.810> shot<00:01:10.080> pocket<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.770> finish<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.130> off
