 Tell me the tip today is how 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.310
 strengthen your neck 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.890
 a part of the body that is often 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.480
 forgotten and ceased to strengthen but she 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.490
 it is extremely important 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.610
 In practice any martial art either 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.040
 hand in the boxing fights as in the fight of the 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.020
 sudene floor wrestling jiu-jitsu one 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.300
 very important region if you have 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.280
 strengthened to prevent injury to your 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 cervical and even to have more 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.750
 resistance some scams that are 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.180
 inserted our head 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.790
 they provoke twist what comes to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.830
 possible knockout and also in the 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.440
 of ground fighting 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.210
 the finalizations the bottlenecks 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 they force our neck 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
 possibly have an injury or 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.120
 even the finalization then the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.990
 growth of this region is very 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.780
 important 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 it's worth losing a little of your 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.560
 As long as you are in fact there 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.290
 earning in benefit to you 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.720
 strengthening your neck start to be 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.179
 difficult end condition 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.909
 the position of Brazil will not differentiate 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.399
 very difficult the very simple very difficult you 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.789
 is doing and happening on the neck 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.590
 I say that yes no maybe so 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.420
 You're going to have the following will not put 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.840
 will leave more schools head on the ground 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.789
 touch the chin on the chest will not go 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:55.009
 import more into the ground will make 20 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:02:02.240
 opposition repeats 124 or will not 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:10.310
 to count on the one hand a two three 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.959
 4 567 until 2011 serves that I continue with 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 my head and suspension and do not leave 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.569
 no time at rest on the floor and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 third exercise is the maybe where I 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.530
 I'm going to get my egg with the ear of 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.830
 hill still suspension 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:37.489
 counting only one side a two three 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:39.260
 four to five replicates can also 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.590
 do it there in two serious two series 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.549
 of 20 of each of the forms of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.110
 execution 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.120
 An interesting detail is you do not 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.730
 steal your own movement and the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.799
 instead of you and with the neck you climb 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.440
 with the game is not a contraction of 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.600
 then it 's really you're 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.500
 working only with your neck 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.880
 descending the home that brought another beauty 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.130
 So do you, too. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.630
 the same way, yes or no maybe 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.140
 is in the position of a board 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.799
 You can have a relaxed knee. 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:22.840
 the same way you will lower neck 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:25.700
 up and yes two three four five six 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.840
 following up to 20 repetitions 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 Even if we do not, maybe 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:40.250
 counting on only one side a two three 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:54.470
 four to five replicates, also for 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:58.010
 no, and maybe 12 456 20 repetitions in 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.100
 two series of 20 competitions with 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.049
 the back on the ground and in the evaluation 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.940
 de bruno knows it's normal you had one 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.549
 little discomfort during the execution 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.480
 exercise the next day and also 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.180
 in the second day 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.269
 even because it's a boy you're not with 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.440
 is not in the habit of stimulating 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.730
 This was the seventh edition 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.799
 about strengthening the neck 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.560
 we will have other issues today let's talk 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.110
 more with new exercises a degree of 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.150
 greater difficulty and even with the use of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.380
 loads with the use of weight where 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.490
 consequently entail a 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.120
 strengthening of its 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 neck 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.830
 I hope you like this edition 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.690
 Do not exercise every day 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.280
 with interval of one day yes no day than 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.290
