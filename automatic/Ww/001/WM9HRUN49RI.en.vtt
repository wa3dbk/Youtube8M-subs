00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
bit brighter there we go and now we can

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.190 
bit brighter there we go and now we can
go<00:05:04.210> over<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.630> top<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:05.050> these<00:05:06.780> but<00:05:07.780> because<00:05:08.050> we

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
go over the top of these but because we

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.810 
go over the top of these but because we
put<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.440> on<00:05:08.530> its<00:05:08.710> own<00:05:08.800> layer<00:05:09.100> then<00:05:09.520> we<00:05:09.670> can

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
put it on its own layer then we can

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.680 
put it on its own layer then we can
erase<00:05:10.120> from<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.600> or<00:05:12.270> blend<00:05:13.270> these<00:05:13.420> two

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.610 
together with blending modes the
possibilities<00:05:16.060> are<00:05:16.090> really<00:05:16.270> endless<00:05:16.620> so
