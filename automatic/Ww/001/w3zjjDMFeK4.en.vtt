00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.779
 so that the first launch has not yet started 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.779
 all on snot 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.460
 as usual scary but not very all the same 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460
 experiment 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.749
 look and be surprised for it works 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:34.850
 or not yet turned on myself so loud 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:34.850
 set the minimum as possible 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.080
 check so as not to burn so the socket 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.150
 Turning the power outlet checked 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.360
 20 volts 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.360
 as if no test speaker 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.360
 turn on 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:01.860
 so when there were no calls yet 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.050
 including music investors do not knock out and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.740
 some faint noise there are speakers well 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.610
 nothing scary it could be the background so 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 how is he on my fox 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.210
 something started singing 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:45.920
 so now turn off and turn on 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:55.610
 large speakers so how to do it 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:58.570
 everyone like wild were not go so my 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.570
 put shake bye 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:09.229
 so its mean I connected the big one 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.459
 column turn on squeak he heard it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.459
 because of the soldering iron most likely 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.599
 so disconnect this 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:31.849
 since i do n't have a high frequency here 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:36.980
 works so everything is ready before pretty 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.880
 loud as 2 by 20 volts even bright 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.730
 days when treated 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.100
 how to see without any distortion this 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.100
 the purest note and on give 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:07.920
 what for shit black very loud 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.920
 230 there is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.640
 25 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 but 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 and so he is all transformer like those 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.900
 as you see this speaker is off 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.900
 it's a process
