00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
 ap 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.490
 perhaps 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.360
 these young spinaliens 23 years abel beretta sports and sorting motivated on 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.420
 the rings and galaxy times the only thing that sets it apart from the others 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.299
 boxers 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.260
 it is this leg prosthesis amputated from the femur six years ago following 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.470
 a two-wheeled accident 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.669
 athens did not want to give up boxing and more specifically to boxing 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:24.880
 Thai 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.769
 everything goes in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.199
 he starts to bodybuilding 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.659
 he is back in the ring today 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.329
 I'll be able 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.799
 more to express more it's really more skills to exploit precisely 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 in the field of boxing thanks to my land 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250
 more security also 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.160
 - security 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 more dynamism 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.990
 the least pain 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.500
 already know it stolen 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.470
 this prosthesis was developed especially for him the fruit of a 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.770
 close collaboration between the overhead manufacturer and his prosthetist 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 nancÃ© claude series on the ring where his body premises that move the most 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.340
 this little gem of technology simulates ankle rotations 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.840
 and knee defection 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 but the real project of appeal is to pass his state certificate of educator 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.350
 athletic 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 in addition to the game 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.009
 he therefore adopted 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.310
 premiums and deposits 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.670
 I would like it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.380
 So I want it in a very prepared field c sipa with the ddjs vosges 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.010
 with our references does not bother me 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
 to see first a course as a disabled worker 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.980
 see the exemptions 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.390
 complete the file 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.350
 Hoping that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.770
 in the polls 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 his entourage a lot of corporate social or other people 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 wallace do not know if it's possible 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.610
 but here is the message from the coast 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.460
 five of the six teams good will its end 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 real lesson of courage and life and the course of the beautiful stable that 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.750
 is listed outdoors 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.670
 remains for the public authorities and the sports structures to allow it to 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.540
 to carry out his professional project despite his disability
