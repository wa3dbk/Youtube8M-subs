00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.420 
39 99 then of course plus sales tax I
probably<00:02:01.530> could<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.770> found<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> may<00:02:02.369> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
probably could have found it may be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
probably could have found it may be
cheaper<00:02:02.700> somewhere<00:02:03.000> else<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:04.079> checked

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
cheaper somewhere else I'm checked

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.350 
cheaper somewhere else I'm checked
around<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.340> figured<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> might

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
around but I was there figured it might

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.610 
around but I was there figured it might
as<00:02:06.450> well<00:02:06.630> pick<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
as well pick it up so the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.949 
as well pick it up so the
it's<00:02:12.459> got<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:14.040> three<00:02:15.040> LEDs<00:02:15.519> here<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.540> ultra

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
it's got the three LEDs here the ultra

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.270 
it's got the three LEDs here the ultra
bright<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.379> then<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.620> got<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:18.190> they

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
bright and then it's got a one what they

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.300 
bright and then it's got a one what they
call<00:02:18.459> them<00:02:18.610> max<00:02:18.879> bride<00:02:19.239> over<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:20.159> which<00:02:21.159> is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
call them max bride over here which is

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
call them max bride over here which is
more<00:02:21.519> kind<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.849> focused<00:02:22.239> beam<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.799> then<00:02:23.799> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
more kind of a focused beam and then you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.380 
more kind of a focused beam and then you
got<00:02:24.129> your<00:02:24.159> three<00:02:24.400> LEDs<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.090> more<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.330> a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
got your three LEDs it one more of a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
got your three LEDs it one more of a
flood<00:02:25.659> which<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.080> know<00:02:26.170> work<00:02:26.349> good<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.560> if

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
flood which you know work good for if

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
flood which you know work good for if
you're<00:02:27.159> just<00:02:27.280> working<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.670> something<00:02:27.909> up

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you're just working on something up

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.130 
you're just working on something up

batteries<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:37.180> sure<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.599> 200<00:02:38.019> hours<00:02:38.230> is

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
batteries I'm sure the 200 hours is

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.680 
batteries I'm sure the 200 hours is
based<00:02:38.590> off<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.180> lowest<00:02:40.180> setting<00:02:40.480> which

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
based off of the lowest setting which

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.710 
based off of the lowest setting which
you<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.170> low<00:02:41.409> here<00:02:41.680> one<00:02:41.950> click<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.819> I'm<00:02:43.390> sorry

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you got low here one click to I'm sorry

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.039 
you got low here one click to I'm sorry
two<00:02:44.349> clicks<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.010> get<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.280> brighter<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:46.840> of

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
two clicks you get the brighter out of

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.199 
two clicks you get the brighter out of
the<00:02:47.140> three<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.739> then<00:02:47.890> if<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.129> hold<00:02:48.400> down<00:02:48.489> once

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
the three and then if you hold down once

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.470 
the three and then if you hold down once
you<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.810> focus<00:02:50.739> beam<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.940> here

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
you get the focus beam and then here

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.390 
you get the focus beam and then here
excuse<00:02:52.900> me<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.680> again<00:02:53.920> hold<00:02:54.220> down

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
excuse me you do this again hold down

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.819 
excuse me you do this again hold down
hit<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.510> again<00:02:55.599> for<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.370> hundred<00:02:57.370> lumens<00:02:57.599> so

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
lamp I'm sure I'll have it for years so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.650 
lamp I'm sure I'll have it for years so
and<00:03:23.579> here's<00:03:24.579> this<00:03:24.760> little<00:03:24.819> more<00:03:25.239> stats<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.599> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
and here's this little more stats on the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.470 
and here's this little more stats on the
modes<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.169> on<00:03:26.440> high<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.459> only<00:03:27.579> get<00:03:27.730> 28<00:03:28.150> hours

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
modes on on high you only get 28 hours

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.449 
modes on on high you only get 28 hours
low<00:03:29.440> on<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.950> focus<00:03:30.280> beam<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:32.190> 5363<00:03:33.190> on

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
low on the focus beam you get 5363 on

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.839 
low on the focus beam you get 5363 on
high<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:33.970> three<00:03:34.470> LEDs<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.500> then<00:03:35.919> 200

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
high on the three LEDs and then 200

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.059 
high on the three LEDs and then 200
hours<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.750> lowest<00:03:38.530> setting<00:03:38.799> right<00:03:39.010> here

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069
