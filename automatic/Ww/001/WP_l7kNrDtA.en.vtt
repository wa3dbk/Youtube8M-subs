start from this is kind of your home
base<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> hacking<00:00:35.370> grid<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:37.530> always

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
base on the hacking grid you always

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
base on the hacking grid you always
start<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.030> send<00:00:39.300> out

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
start from this and you you send out

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
start from this and you you send out
your<00:00:39.570> trace<00:00:39.840> towards<00:00:40.260> other<00:00:40.620> positions<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
your trace towards other positions and I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.040 
your trace towards other positions and I
will<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.270> positions<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> should

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
will go into which positions you should

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.889 
will go into which positions you should
go<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.440> later<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> tutorial<00:00:44.719> this<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
go for later on in the tutorial this is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.830 
go for later on in the tutorial this is
where<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.140> trying<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
where you're trying to get this is the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.760 
where you're trying to get this is the
basically<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.079> server<00:00:49.320> you're<00:00:49.500> trying<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
basically the server you're trying to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
basically the server you're trying to
get<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> hack<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
get into if you hack it you get into the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
get into if you hack it you get into the
system<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.489> successfully<00:00:53.489> hacked

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
system and you have successfully hacked

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
system and you have successfully hacked
it<00:00:53.940> sometimes<00:00:54.570> there's<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.930> than<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.289> if

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it sometimes there's more than one if

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
it sometimes there's more than one if
there<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there is you need to get all of them you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.660 
there is you need to get all of them you
need<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> capture<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.280> hack<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
need to capture all of them to hack the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.410 
need to capture all of them to hack the
system<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.070> enemy<00:01:02.940> home<00:01:03.149> base

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
system this is the enemy home base

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 
system this is the enemy home base
basically<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.229> where<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> firewall<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
basically this is where the firewall I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
basically this is where the firewall I
don't<00:01:06.119> know<00:01:06.180> where<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.630> try<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
don't know where it is they try and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
don't know where it is they try and
trace<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.400> set<00:01:08.610> off

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
trace you from here so if they set off

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
trace you from here so if they set off
the<00:01:08.880> alarm<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:09.750> capturing<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.229> point<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.830> they

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the alarm by capturing a point they they

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
the alarm by capturing a point they they
come<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.939> try<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.090> capture<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
come from here and try and capture your

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.969 
come from here and try and capture your
home<00:01:12.900> base<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.590> capture<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
home base and if they capture the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
home base and if they capture the
hacking<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.520> over<00:01:14.869> on<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> side<00:01:16.229> note<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
hacking is over on a side note if you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
hacking is over on a side note if you
capture<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.759> enemy's<00:01:18.090> home<00:01:18.210> base<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.080> get

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
capture the enemy's home base you get

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.940 
capture the enemy's home base you get
all<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> bonus<00:01:20.659> items<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.619> grid

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
all of the bonus items from that grid

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.289 
all of the bonus items from that grid
even<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.430> didn't<00:01:23.640> capture<00:01:23.880> them<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
even if you didn't capture them it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
even if you didn't capture them it
basically<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.200> wipe<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.130> whole

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
basically just you wipe out the whole

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.590 
basically just you wipe out the whole
thing<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.729> everything<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thing you get everything that was in it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.890 
thing you get everything that was in it
this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> normal<00:01:29.040> point<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.329> doesn't<00:01:30.750> have

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this is a normal point it doesn't have

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
this is a normal point it doesn't have
anything<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.530> anything<00:01:32.070> except<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
anything to do with anything except you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.450 
anything to do with anything except you
have<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> capture<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> another<00:01:33.840> point

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
have to capture to get to another point

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.310 
have to capture to get to another point
the<00:01:35.460> lower<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> number<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.390> easier<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the lower the number the easier it is to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.850 
the lower the number the easier it is to
hack<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.890> faster<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.490> hacked<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
hack the faster it will be hacked and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
hack the faster it will be hacked and
the<00:01:40.860> less<00:01:41.130> chance<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> getting

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the less chance you have of getting

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.800 
the less chance you have of getting
caught<00:01:42.630> usually<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:44.040> next<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:45.509> spam

might make one of the harder areas

might make one of the harder areas
easier<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> after<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.320> the

easier and after that we have the

easier and after that we have the
treasure<00:02:05.040> boxes<00:02:05.700> basically<00:02:06.210> you're<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I hacked everything in the game every

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.120 
I hacked everything in the game every

wall panel every door every lock every
you<00:02:18.460> know<00:02:18.490> every<00:02:18.790> safe<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:20.560> got<00:02:21.430> quite<00:02:21.580> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you know every safe and I got quite a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.120 
you know every safe and I got quite a
few<00:02:21.760> ugh<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.960> say<00:02:23.320> hacking<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.950> way<00:02:24.070> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
few ugh so I I say hacking is the way to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.010 
few ugh so I I say hacking is the way to
go<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.490> Deus<00:02:24.760> Ex<00:02:24.970> anyway<00:02:25.420> let's<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.900> to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
go for Deus Ex anyway let's get on to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.970 
go for Deus Ex anyway let's get on to
the<00:02:26.110> specifics

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the specifics

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.580 
the specifics
okay<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:27.730> rule<00:02:28.090> number<00:02:28.120> one<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.810> always<00:02:29.020> go<00:02:29.350> for

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
okay so rule number one is always go for

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.180 
okay so rule number one is always go for
the<00:02:29.680> enemy's<00:02:30.100> home<00:02:30.970> base<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.570> red<00:02:31.840> box<00:02:32.190> this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the enemy's home base that red box this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.880 
the enemy's home base that red box this
looks<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> complicated<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.800> know

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
looks like a complicated you know

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.080 
looks like a complicated you know
hacking<00:02:36.310> game<00:02:36.520> you're<00:02:36.730> going<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.880> have<00:02:37.060> a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
hacking game you're going to have a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.000 
hacking game you're going to have a
bunch<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.540> boxes<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.990> all<00:02:38.260> spread<00:02:38.590> out<00:02:38.770> you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
bunch of boxes that all spread out you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
bunch of boxes that all spread out you
got<00:02:39.130> all<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.430> numbers<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.940> calculate<00:02:40.290> first

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
got all the numbers to calculate first

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.380 
got all the numbers to calculate first
thing<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.710> do<00:02:41.860> every<00:02:42.400> time<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.910> look<00:02:43.120> at<00:02:43.240> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
thing you do every time is look at that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.990 
thing you do every time is look at that
red<00:02:43.570> box<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.320> if<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.530> has<00:02:44.710> any<00:02:44.820> access<00:02:45.820> if

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
red box and see if it has any access if

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760 
red box and see if it has any access if
there's<00:02:46.210> if<00:02:46.480> there's<00:02:46.840> no<00:02:47.050> arrows<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
there's if there's no arrows on the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.770 
there's if there's no arrows on the
lines<00:02:48.010> coming<00:02:48.430> from<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.790> then<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.360> can<00:02:49.510> go<00:02:49.720> to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
lines coming from it then you can go to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.260 
lines coming from it then you can go to
that<00:02:50.500> red<00:02:50.830> box<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.490> hack<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.000> get

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
that red box and if you hack it you get

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.060 
that red box and if you hack it you get
all<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> treasure<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.500> hidden<00:02:53.740> in<00:02:53.950> this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
all the treasure that's hidden in this

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.910 
all the treasure that's hidden in this
grid<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.640> it's<00:02:55.600> almost<00:02:55.810> always<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.620> best<00:02:56.800> idea

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
grid so it's almost always the best idea

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.820 
grid so it's almost always the best idea
to<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.400> go<00:02:57.580> for<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> red<00:02:58.000> box<00:02:58.240> if<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:59.050> if

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
to just go for the red box if you can if

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.220 
to just go for the red box if you can if
it's<00:03:00.070> only<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:01.210> way<00:03:01.420> arrows<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.200> other

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it's only one way arrows going the other

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.620 
it's only one way arrows going the other
way<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.370> can't<00:03:03.580> get<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.000> box<00:03:04.180> then

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
way and you can't get to the box then

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.210 
way and you can't get to the box then
you<00:03:04.660> have<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.020> do<00:03:05.200> some<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:05.470> strategizing

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
you have to do some more strategizing

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.220 
you have to do some more strategizing
but<00:03:06.520> if<00:03:06.790> that's<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.210> there<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.990> mean

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
but if that's all there is to it I mean

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
but if that's all there is to it I mean
take<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.950> box<00:03:09.130> get<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.610> treasure<00:03:09.850> you're

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
take the box get all the treasure you're

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
take the box get all the treasure you're
done<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.630> always<00:03:11.020> go<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> box<00:03:11.680> first<00:03:12.010> if

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
done so always go to the box first if

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.770 
done so always go to the box first if
you<00:03:12.640> can't<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> enemy<00:03:13.330> box<00:03:15.510> alright<00:03:16.510> for<00:03:16.720> this

right<00:03:22.840> top<00:03:23.380> right<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.920> top<00:03:24.430> left<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.030> can't

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
right top right and top left I can't

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
right top right and top left I can't
take<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.810> red<00:03:25.990> box<00:03:26.260> because<00:03:26.710> they're<00:03:26.890> one-way

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
take the red box because they're one-way

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.580 
take the red box because they're one-way
arrows<00:03:27.640> away<00:03:28.120> from<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.570> both<00:03:28.870> sides<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.560> I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
arrows away from it both sides so I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.460 
arrows away from it both sides so I
can't<00:03:29.950> take<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.400> red<00:03:30.580> box<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.410> to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
can't take the red box so I'm going to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.810 
can't take the red box so I'm going to
start<00:03:32.680> with<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> low<00:03:33.130> numbers<00:03:33.520> because<00:03:33.760> I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
start with the low numbers because I

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.820 
start with the low numbers because I
don't<00:03:33.940> want<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.120> get<00:03:34.270> caught<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:34.540> away<00:03:34.830> and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
don't want to get caught right away and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.710 
don't want to get caught right away and
I<00:03:36.400> choose<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.820> one<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> right<00:03:37.330> instead<00:03:37.660> of

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
I choose the one on the right instead of

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.480 
I choose the one on the right instead of
the<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:37.990> on<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.140> left<00:03:38.380> because<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.130> need<00:03:39.370> to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
the one on the left because I need to

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.220 
the one on the left because I need to
take<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.850> one<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.270> get<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.540> treasure<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
take that one to get the treasure in the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.950 
take that one to get the treasure in the
top<00:03:41.500> right<00:03:42.330> after<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.480> I'm<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.870> to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
top right after that I'm just going to

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960 
top right after that I'm just going to
work<00:03:44.140> my<00:03:44.170> way<00:03:44.350> with<00:03:44.650> low<00:03:44.890> numbers<00:03:45.070> up<00:03:45.520> towards

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
work my way with low numbers up towards

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.880 
work my way with low numbers up towards
all<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.300> stuff<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.690> have<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.200> get<00:03:47.410> sooner

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
all the stuff that I have to get sooner

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.230 
all the stuff that I have to get sooner
or<00:03:47.980> later<00:03:48.070> I'm<00:03:48.400> going<00:03:48.520> to<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> low<00:03:49.000> ones

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
or later I'm going to do the low ones

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.950 
or later I'm going to do the low ones
first<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:51.520> once<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.150> take<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.480> one<00:03:52.690> I'll

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
first and now once I take this one I'll

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.380 
first and now once I take this one I'll
be<00:03:53.020> free<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.680> take<00:03:53.890> my<00:03:54.190> home<00:03:54.700> base<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.120> win<00:03:55.270> the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
be free to take my home base and win the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
be free to take my home base and win the
hack<00:03:55.600> but<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.960> want<00:03:56.170> all<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.350> treasures<00:03:56.770> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
hack but I want all the treasures and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.550 
hack but I want all the treasures and
I'm<00:03:57.790> looking<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.570> thinking<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.290> know<00:03:59.380> those

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
I'm looking and thinking you know those

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.020 
I'm looking and thinking you know those
fours<00:03:59.920> are<00:04:00.100> going<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.280> take<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.490> while<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.730> hack

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
fours are going to take a while to hack

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.810 
fours are going to take a while to hack
so<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.420> may<00:04:01.630> as<00:04:01.690> well<00:04:01.780> start<00:04:02.200> them<00:04:02.440> off<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.980> then

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
so I may as well start them off and then

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.550 
so I may as well start them off and then
start<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.270> other<00:04:04.510> ones<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:05.350> kind

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
start the other ones so that they kind

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.920 
start the other ones so that they kind
of<00:04:05.620> all<00:04:05.830> end<00:04:06.070> at<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> same<00:04:06.550> time<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:07.690> I'm<00:04:07.780> going

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
of all end at the same time so I'm going

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.600 
of all end at the same time so I'm going
to<00:04:08.020> hack<00:04:08.200> both<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.770> fours<00:04:09.010> at<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.220> same<00:04:09.430> time

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
to hack both the fours at the same time

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.090 
to hack both the fours at the same time
assuming<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.240> I'll<00:04:10.360> get<00:04:10.540> caught<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.140> just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
assuming that I'll get caught and just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.530 
assuming that I'll get caught and just
figure<00:04:12.370> I'll<00:04:12.520> have<00:04:12.670> enough<00:04:12.940> time<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.390> finish

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
figure I'll have enough time to finish

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.650 
figure I'll have enough time to finish
the<00:04:14.040> hack<00:04:15.040> because<00:04:15.880> these<00:04:16.150> are<00:04:16.299> all<00:04:16.420> load

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
the hack because these are all load

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.780 
the hack because these are all load
numbers<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:18.040> 1<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.850> 2

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
numbers so the 1 to 2

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.310 
numbers so the 1 to 2
and<00:04:20.150> then<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.230> final<00:04:21.680> two<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:23.540> if<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.110> need

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
and then the final two and if you need

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200 
and then the final two and if you need
to<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.650> press<00:04:24.860> spacebar<00:04:25.190> for<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.790> slow<00:04:26.090> it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
to you press spacebar for the slow it

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.350 
to you press spacebar for the slow it
down<00:04:26.240> or<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.740> can<00:04:27.890> just<00:04:28.100> use<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.520> new<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:29.120> take

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
down or you can just use the new to take

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.400 
down or you can just use the new to take
you<00:04:29.570> know<00:04:29.690> one<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.200> last<00:04:30.380> ones<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:33.170> one's

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
you know one of the last ones this one's

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.800 
you know one of the last ones this one's
a<00:04:33.650> little<00:04:34.460> harder<00:04:34.880> but<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.120> get<00:04:35.330> lucky<00:04:35.660> with

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
a little harder but I get lucky with

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.530 
a little harder but I get lucky with
this<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.320> obviously<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:37.160> save<00:04:37.520> before<00:04:38.180> you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
this and obviously you save before you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.110 
this and obviously you save before you
hacked<00:04:38.750> into<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.670> device<00:04:40.670> you're<00:04:40.850> trying<00:04:40.880> to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
hacked into the device you're trying to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.180 
hacked into the device you're trying to
hack<00:04:41.240> save<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:41.960> then<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:42.770> you're<00:04:42.980> going<00:04:43.100> to

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
hack save it and then if you're going to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.770 
hack save it and then if you're going to
get<00:04:43.370> caught<00:04:43.610> or<00:04:43.880> if<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.120> set<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.450> off<00:04:44.570> right

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
get caught or if that set it off right

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.660 
get caught or if that set it off right
there<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.050> first<00:04:45.350> one<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.890> just<00:04:46.310> escape

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
there on that first one you just escape

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.790 
there on that first one you just escape
out<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.030> try<00:04:47.240> again<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.200> try<00:04:48.320> all<00:04:48.530> all

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
out and try again you can try all all

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.370 
out and try again you can try all all
three<00:04:49.100> or<00:04:49.280> four<00:04:49.310> times<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.420> fail<00:04:50.840> you

three or four times if you you fail you

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.840 
three or four times if you you fail you
can<00:04:51.530> either<00:04:51.710> wait<00:04:51.830> for<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.130> 30-second<00:04:52.670> timer

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
can either wait for the 30-second timer

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.520 
can either wait for the 30-second timer
to<00:04:53.030> run<00:04:53.180> out<00:04:53.330> or<00:04:53.480> whatever<00:04:53.600> or<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:53.990> can<00:04:54.380> just

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
to run out or whatever or you can just

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.970 
to run out or whatever or you can just
load<00:04:54.710> your<00:04:54.890> last<00:04:55.070> save<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.640> try<00:04:55.910> again<00:04:56.980> right

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
load your last save and try again right

here after I start this I'm going to

here after I start this I'm going to
fortify<00:04:59.780> right<00:05:00.200> there<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.620> bottom<00:05:00.920> that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
fortify right there the bottom that

fortify right there the bottom that
yellow<00:05:01.730> thing<00:05:02.720> counting<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.230> is<00:05:03.380> fortify<00:05:03.890> and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
yellow thing counting up is fortify and

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.820 
yellow thing counting up is fortify and
that<00:05:04.610> adds<00:05:04.820> adds<00:05:05.270> one<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.260> number<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.590> you

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
that adds adds one to the number and you

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.280 
that adds adds one to the number and you
can<00:05:07.010> use<00:05:07.850> augments<00:05:08.480> to<00:05:08.630> get<00:05:08.780> more<00:05:09.080> than<00:05:09.230> one

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290

added<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.400> what<00:05:11.330> that<00:05:11.510> does<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.840> it

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
added to it and what that does is it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.410 
added to it and what that does is it
makes<00:05:12.200> that<00:05:12.410> redline<00:05:12.710> stop<00:05:13.400> at<00:05:13.670> it<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.120> takes

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
makes that redline stop at it it takes

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.270 
makes that redline stop at it it takes
longer<00:05:14.780> for<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.050> hack<00:05:15.290> that<00:05:15.530> point<00:05:15.830> which

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
longer for it to hack that point which

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.090 
longer for it to hack that point which
gives<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.760> longer<00:05:17.750> time<00:05:18.080> period<00:05:18.500> before<00:05:18.800> the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
gives you longer time period before the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.060 
gives you longer time period before the
red<00:05:19.340> bar<00:05:19.610> reaches<00:05:20.480> your<00:05:20.990> home<00:05:21.200> base<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.740> hacks

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
red bar reaches your home base and hacks

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.810 
red bar reaches your home base and hacks
you<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:23.300> fortify<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.290> a<00:05:24.440> good<00:05:24.620> idea<00:05:24.710> at<00:05:25.190> central

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
you so fortify is a good idea at central

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.910 
you so fortify is a good idea at central
nodes<00:05:26.060> that<00:05:26.480> are<00:05:26.630> high<00:05:26.810> numbers<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.650> it

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
nodes that are high numbers so that it

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.340 
nodes that are high numbers so that it
has<00:05:28.100> to<00:05:28.310> go<00:05:28.460> through<00:05:28.760> it<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.150> it's<00:05:29.840> also<00:05:30.020> its

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
has to go through it and it's also its

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.540 
has to go through it and it's also its
high<00:05:30.590> number<00:05:30.920> already<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:31.310> it's<00:05:31.400> going<00:05:31.490> to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
high number already so it's going to

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.010 
high number already so it's going to
take<00:05:31.760> a<00:05:31.820> while<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.030> hack<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.510> just<00:05:32.840> you

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
take a while to hack you just you

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.780 
take a while to hack you just you
fortify<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.530> it'll<00:05:33.740> take<00:05:33.890> even<00:05:34.220> longer<00:05:34.400> and

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
fortify it it'll take even longer and

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.400 
fortify it it'll take even longer and
that<00:05:34.970> just<00:05:35.150> gives<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.450> some<00:05:35.630> extra<00:05:35.960> time<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
that just gives you some extra time and

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.130 
that just gives you some extra time and
finally<00:05:37.160> I'm<00:05:37.250> going<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.490> show<00:05:37.670> you<00:05:37.900> just<00:05:38.900> kind

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
finally I'm going to show you just kind

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.530 
finally I'm going to show you just kind
of<00:05:39.200> using<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.010> spam<00:05:40.760> or<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.270> gear

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
of using the the spam or the gear

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.380 
of using the the spam or the gear
looking<00:05:41.840> things<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.980> lower<00:05:43.250> other<00:05:43.610> numbers<00:05:44.060> so

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
looking things to lower other numbers so

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.250 
looking things to lower other numbers so
I'm<00:05:45.080> going<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:45.380> do<00:05:45.470> this<00:05:45.850> 5-1<00:05:46.960> I'm<00:05:47.960> going<00:05:48.200> to

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
I'm going to do this 5-1 I'm going to

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.680 
I'm going to do this 5-1 I'm going to
nuke<00:05:48.530> it<00:05:48.740> because<00:05:49.400> 5<00:05:49.700> is<00:05:49.730> pretty<00:05:50.150> high<00:05:50.330> and

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
nuke it because 5 is pretty high and

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.690 
nuke it because 5 is pretty high and
then<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:51.500> see<00:05:51.680> that<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:52.010> lowers<00:05:52.220> some<00:05:52.520> of<00:05:52.610> the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
then you see that it lowers some of the

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.850 
then you see that it lowers some of the
numbers<00:05:53.030> was<00:05:53.240> I<00:05:53.390> took<00:05:53.450> Etsy<00:05:53.930> negative<00:05:54.410> 2<00:05:54.650> right

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
numbers was I took Etsy negative 2 right

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.640 
numbers was I took Etsy negative 2 right
there<00:05:55.100> so<00:05:55.610> now<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.180> 0<00:05:56.480> with<00:05:57.080> 0<00:05:57.110> there's

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
there so now that the 0 with 0 there's

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.650 
there so now that the 0 with 0 there's
no<00:05:58.160> chance<00:05:58.520> that<00:05:58.850> they're<00:05:58.970> going<00:05:59.060> to<00:05:59.180> catch<00:05:59.390> me

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
no chance that they're going to catch me

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.380 
no chance that they're going to catch me
when<00:05:59.840> I<00:05:59.870> hack<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:04.160> pretty<00:06:04.970> much<00:06:05.060> have<00:06:05.330> a

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
when I hack it so I pretty much have a

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.900 
when I hack it so I pretty much have a
bunch<00:06:05.570> of<00:06:05.660> short<00:06:05.990> hacks<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:06.680> so<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.220> got<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.610> 3

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
bunch of short hacks and so I got the 3

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.550 
bunch of short hacks and so I got the 3
started<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.600> I<00:06:08.810> can<00:06:08.930> get<00:06:09.050> these<00:06:09.140> other<00:06:09.350> ones

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
started and I can get these other ones

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.060 
started and I can get these other ones
nearly<00:06:09.950> finished<00:06:10.190> by<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.640> time<00:06:10.850> it<00:06:11.030> was<00:06:11.150> done

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
nearly finished by the time it was done

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.130 
nearly finished by the time it was done
and<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.250> just<00:06:13.430> just<00:06:14.360> give<00:06:14.570> yourself<00:06:14.900> enough

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
and you just just give yourself enough

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.970 
and you just just give yourself enough
time<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.710> finish

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
time to finish

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.790 
time to finish
so<00:06:17.760> that<00:06:17.940> concludes<00:06:18.390> my<00:06:18.600> hacking<00:06:18.990> tutorial<00:06:19.620> it

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
so that concludes my hacking tutorial it

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.130 
so that concludes my hacking tutorial it
was<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:19.920> little<00:06:20.160> quick<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.910> little<00:06:21.210> unpolished<00:06:21.600> I

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
was a little quick a little unpolished I

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.720 
was a little quick a little unpolished I
apologize<00:06:22.740> for<00:06:22.890> that<00:06:22.980> hopefully<00:06:23.430> it<00:06:23.520> helps

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730
