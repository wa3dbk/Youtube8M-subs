okay
looking<00:00:11.969> at<00:00:12.060> these<00:00:13.490> motors<00:00:14.490> upon<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.120> bike

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
looking at these motors upon your bike

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.150 
looking at these motors upon your bike
get<00:00:15.660> out<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.020> make<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> easy<00:00:16.439> food<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> paddle

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
get out and make the easy food a paddle

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.089 
get out and make the easy food a paddle
or<00:00:17.189> hell<00:00:17.460> no<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> got<00:00:19.110> a<00:00:19.140> forward<00:00:19.590> anything<00:00:19.860> like

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
or hell no I got a forward anything like

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.609 
or hell no I got a forward anything like
that<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:21.710> wife<00:00:22.710> got<00:00:23.450> it's<00:00:24.450> an<00:00:24.660> old<00:00:24.869> battery

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that so wife got it's an old battery

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
that so wife got it's an old battery
drill<00:00:26.210> they're<00:00:29.180> buckling<00:00:30.180> no<00:00:30.360> longer<00:00:30.660> holds<00:00:30.989> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
drill they're buckling no longer holds a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900 
drill they're buckling no longer holds a
charge<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.649> anything<00:00:31.860> on<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.759> other

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
charge or anything on it but the other

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.080 
charge or anything on it but the other
the<00:00:33.329> motor<00:00:33.800> yeah<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.399> strong<00:00:35.700> look<00:00:35.880> that's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the motor yeah pretty strong look that's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
the motor yeah pretty strong look that's
only<00:00:36.149> twelve<00:00:36.600> volt<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.109> think<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.379> will<00:00:37.500> eat

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
only twelve volt but I think I will eat

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
only twelve volt but I think I will eat
Dean<00:00:37.949> somewhere<00:00:38.460> confine<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.480> she<00:00:39.680> thought

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
Dean somewhere confine it so she thought

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.299 
Dean somewhere confine it so she thought
I'd<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.949> this<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> skip<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> drill<00:00:43.109> down<00:00:43.320> took

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I'd do this so skip the drill down took

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.479 
I'd do this so skip the drill down took
the<00:00:44.429> motor<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.960> kept<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.109> trigger<00:00:46.590> because

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the motor out kept the trigger because

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.569 
the motor out kept the trigger because
obviously<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.910> trigger<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:49.280> graduated<00:00:50.280> speed

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
obviously the trigger is graduated speed

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
obviously the trigger is graduated speed
as<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.359> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.839> pole<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.260> will

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
as well you know a little pole it will

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
as well you know a little pole it will
give<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.679> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.219> speed<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
give you a little bit of speed and you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
give you a little bit of speed and you
know<00:00:54.030> until<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.660> full<00:00:54.899> power<00:00:55.429> so<00:00:56.429> that's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
know until you get full power so that's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.319 
know until you get full power so that's
like<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> speed<00:00:57.719> controller<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.089> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like a speed controller and that one is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
like a speed controller and that one is
just<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.780> thermal<00:01:01.199> cutout<00:01:01.710> switch<00:01:02.159> where

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
just like a thermal cutout switch where

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
just like a thermal cutout switch where
I<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:03.030> cutter<00:01:03.239> offered<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.899> exactly

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I do my cutter offered to know exactly

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.680 
I do my cutter offered to know exactly
you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.550> where<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:05.970> affect<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.540> in

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
you know where they would affect it in

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.680 
you know where they would affect it in
anyway<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.230> Ali<00:01:07.800> rock<00:01:07.980> it's<00:01:08.160> not<00:01:08.310> problem<00:01:08.690> so

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
anyway so Ali rock it's not problem so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.540 
anyway so Ali rock it's not problem so
what<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> did<00:01:10.050> was<00:01:10.920> connected<00:01:11.850> these<00:01:11.940> wires<00:01:13.550> you

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
what I did was connected these wires you

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.300 
what I did was connected these wires you
know<00:01:14.640> they're<00:01:14.820> quite<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> length<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.130> allow

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
know they're quite a length now to allow

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.300 
know they're quite a length now to allow
me<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.550> fit<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:20.360> handlebars<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
me to fit this to the handlebars of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.240 
me to fit this to the handlebars of
something<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.750> beer<00:01:25.250> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
something on there or the back beer so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.170 
something on there or the back beer so
it<00:01:26.640> allowed<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.270> bugged<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:30.060> know

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it allowed me to bugged it to you know

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020 
it allowed me to bugged it to you know
handlebars<00:01:30.810> sort<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.440> thing<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.030> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
handlebars sort of thing with you and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
handlebars sort of thing with you and
and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> course<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.610> wires

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and then of course I got the wires

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
and then of course I got the wires
running<00:01:36.810> from<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.410> mold<00:01:37.620> I<00:01:37.800> put<00:01:38.130> that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
running from the mold I put that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
running from the mold I put that
probably<00:01:39.300> underneath<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.290> bike<00:01:41.300> by<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.330> back

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
probably underneath the bike by the back

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
probably underneath the bike by the back
wheel<00:01:42.900> I've<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.590> some<00:01:44.570> wheels<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.260> go<00:01:46.770> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
wheel I've got some wheels you to go on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
wheel I've got some wheels you to go on
it<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:48.770> rub<00:01:49.770> against<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> wheel<00:01:50.370> they<00:01:50.550> rustle

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
it to rub against the wheel they rustle

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.570 
it to rub against the wheel they rustle
they<00:01:51.240> should<00:01:51.590> look<00:01:52.590> pretty<00:01:52.650> good<00:01:53.130> I've<00:01:53.370> just

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
they should look pretty good I've just

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.300 
they should look pretty good I've just
got<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.850> weld<00:01:54.740> an<00:01:56.000> extra<00:01:57.000> thread<00:01:57.870> onto<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:59.280> now

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
got to weld an extra thread onto it now

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.570 
got to weld an extra thread onto it now
I<00:01:59.490> got<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> thread<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:01.130> put<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.220> into<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
I got the thread here I put it into a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.150 
I got the thread here I put it into a
block<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:05.550> can<00:02:06.240> push<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:07.080> motor<00:02:07.620> in<00:02:07.800> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
block so that I can push the motor in so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
block so that I can push the motor in so
it<00:02:08.220> fits<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.140> through<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it fits and then I can see through the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
it fits and then I can see through the
hole<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:12.470> pieces<00:02:13.470> meet<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:15.080> put<00:02:16.080> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
hole where the two pieces meet and put a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.900 
hole where the two pieces meet and put a
welding<00:02:16.530> rod<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:16.980> welded<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.640> just

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
welding rod in there welded and I just

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.330 
welding rod in there welded and I just
just<00:02:18.060> around<00:02:18.360> when<00:02:18.690> I've<00:02:18.810> done<00:02:19.190> they're<00:02:20.190> going

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
just around when I've done they're going

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.950 
just around when I've done they're going
to<00:02:20.400> probably<00:02:21.030> pull<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> wood<00:02:21.570> off<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
to probably pull the wood off but I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.930 
to probably pull the wood off but I
lawyer<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.470> cut<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.640> chisel

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
lawyer just cut it you just put chisel

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.260 
lawyer just cut it you just put chisel
on<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
on it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.380 
on it
smash<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> bits<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.030> gotta<00:02:27.210> make<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
smash the bits like so I gotta make a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.140 
smash the bits like so I gotta make a
bracket<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.900> I'll<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.320> fit<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
bracket and I'll see to fit it to the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.570 
bracket and I'll see to fit it to the
underneath<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> bike<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:32.220> was

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
underneath of the bike and I was

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.400 
underneath of the bike and I was
thinking<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:33.000> using<00:02:33.240> perhaps<00:02:33.600> an<00:02:33.840> old<00:02:34.020> break

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
thinking of using perhaps an old break

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.590 
thinking of using perhaps an old break
leave<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.800> off<00:02:34.890> another<00:02:35.160> bike<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> cable

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
leave it off another bike and the cable

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.310 
leave it off another bike and the cable
to<00:02:37.580> activate<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.970> pull<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:42.290> brake<00:02:43.290> lever

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
to activate it so I pull the brake lever

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.380 
to activate it so I pull the brake lever
you<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.670> put<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
you know that I put on the like the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.770 
you know that I put on the like the
extra<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.870> it'll<00:02:46.680> move<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.010> motor<00:02:47.190> up

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
extra one it'll move the motor up

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.330 
extra one it'll move the motor up
against<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> wheel<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.830> then<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> can

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
against the wheel and and then I can

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.280 
against the wheel and and then I can
pull<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> trigger<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> anytime<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.110> want

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
pull the trigger that and anytime I want

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.800 
pull the trigger that and anytime I want
to<00:02:55.350> slow<00:02:55.530> down<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:55.980> leased<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.810> brake

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to slow down I just leased the brake

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.290 
to slow down I just leased the brake
lever<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.470> motor<00:02:58.710> moves<00:02:58.980> away<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.490> you<00:03:00.210> know

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
lever the motor moves away and you know

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.030 
lever the motor moves away and you know
there's<00:03:00.630> no<00:03:00.750> drag<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> they're<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.950> you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
there's no drag on it they're like you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.730 
there's no drag on it they're like you
know<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:04.170> thought<00:03:04.320> people<00:03:04.680> are

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
know so I just thought people are

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.200 
know so I just thought people are
surprised<00:03:05.100> I'm<00:03:05.310> seen<00:03:05.490> anybody<00:03:05.670> else<00:03:05.880> do<00:03:06.180> it

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
surprised I'm seen anybody else do it

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.540 
surprised I'm seen anybody else do it
with<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> battery<00:03:07.200> drill<00:03:07.320> I've<00:03:07.890> seen<00:03:08.190> people

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
with a battery drill I've seen people

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.520 
with a battery drill I've seen people
put<00:03:08.580> back<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> drills<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.600> bikes<00:03:10.020> with<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
put back to drills on bikes with like a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.040 
put back to drills on bikes with like a
wheel<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.880> whole<00:03:12.090> drill<00:03:12.420> also<00:03:12.660> then

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
wheel on and the whole drill also then

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.560 
wheel on and the whole drill also then
so<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.160> what<00:03:14.670> I'm<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.330> I've<00:03:15.540> got

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
so but what I'm going to do is I've got

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.810 
so but what I'm going to do is I've got
one<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.260> these<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:17.300> 12<00:03:18.300> volt<00:03:19.370> 12<00:03:20.370> amp<00:03:20.640> hour

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
one of these a 12 volt 12 amp hour

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.949 
one of these a 12 volt 12 amp hour
batteries<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.680> thought<00:03:22.950> I'd<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
batteries so what I thought I'd do is

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.140 
batteries so what I thought I'd do is
running<00:03:24.959> off<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.110> these<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.770> mean<00:03:26.640> I've<00:03:26.760> got<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
couple of them so I could run her off

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.900 
couple of them so I could run her off
two<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.010> them<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.550> where<00:03:29.820> they

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
two of them but you know where they

two of them but you know where they
build<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.330> moat<00:03:30.510> dirt<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:30.990> 24<00:03:31.500> volts

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
build a moat dirt for the 24 volts

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.060 
build a moat dirt for the 24 volts
through<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.630> but<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.959> have<00:03:34.080> got<00:03:34.110> 18<00:03:34.650> volt<00:03:34.860> one

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
through it but I have got 18 volt one

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.800 
through it but I have got 18 volt one
somewhere<00:03:35.490> I<00:03:35.520> could<00:03:35.850> trade<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.510> one<00:03:36.690> we
