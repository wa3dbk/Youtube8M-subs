think<00:01:25.219> this<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.939> taking<00:01:26.509> place<00:01:26.539> in<00:01:26.930> on<00:01:27.049> the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
think this is taking place in on the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.080 
think this is taking place in on the
near<00:01:27.350> future<00:01:27.670> technology<00:01:28.670> has<00:01:28.789> advanced

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
near future technology has advanced

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.679 
near future technology has advanced
greatly<00:01:29.259> able<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:30.380> do<00:01:30.530> those<00:01:31.270> screens<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.479> in

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
greatly able to do those screens like in

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.330 
greatly able to do those screens like in
the<00:01:32.840> air<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.289> don't<00:01:33.469> know<00:01:33.530> at<00:01:33.859> first<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.189> thought

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
the air I don't know at first I thought

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.859 
the air I don't know at first I thought
they<00:01:34.399> were<00:01:34.579> already<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.030> game<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:35.479> no<00:01:35.659> I

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
they were already in the game but no I

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.389 
they were already in the game but no I
guess<00:01:36.259> that's<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.560> how<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.829> world<00:01:36.920> works<00:01:37.219> in

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
guess that's just how the world works in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.940 
guess that's just how the world works in
this<00:01:37.520> anime<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.259> they<00:01:39.259> played<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.680> game

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
this anime and they played this game

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
this anime and they played this game

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.069 
I also like the park you know they play
in<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.849> game<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.420> when<00:03:27.599> they<00:03:27.690> enter<00:03:27.930> that

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
in the game then when they enter that

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.449 
in the game then when they enter that
game<00:03:28.260> look<00:03:28.470> pretty<00:03:28.709> badass<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
game look pretty badass you know it

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.770 
game look pretty badass you know it
looks<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.060> be<00:03:30.090> random<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.750> times

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
looks like it could be random at times

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.210 
looks like it could be random at times
but<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.410> makes<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.769> more<00:03:31.829> really

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
but that just makes it more really

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.970 
but that just makes it more really
surprising<00:03:33.209> or<00:03:33.329> shocking<00:03:33.359> more<00:03:33.750> unique<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.260> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
surprising or shocking more unique and I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.349 
surprising or shocking more unique and I
actually<00:03:35.100> did<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.730> part<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> of

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
actually did like that part of the of

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.330 
actually did like that part of the of
the<00:03:36.450> episode<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.440> am<00:03:37.620> quite<00:03:37.859> enjoying<00:03:38.040> this

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the episode so I am quite enjoying this

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.530 
the episode so I am quite enjoying this
episode<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.790> far<00:03:38.819> hopefully<00:03:39.180> they<00:03:39.420> don't

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
episode so far hopefully they don't

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.849 
episode so far hopefully they don't
think<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.810> yeah<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.109> too<00:03:40.260> far<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.680> if

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
think that yeah with too far you know if

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.830 
think that yeah with too far you know if
they<00:03:41.010> don't<00:03:41.220> take<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.519> far<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.180> would<00:03:42.480> watch<00:03:42.660> it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
they don't take it far I would watch it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.780 
they don't take it far I would watch it
i<00:03:42.870> will<00:03:42.989> keep<00:03:43.079> using<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:43.829> hopefully<00:03:44.459> they

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
i will keep using it but hopefully they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.819 
i will keep using it but hopefully they
don't<00:03:44.940> see<00:03:45.299> hopefully<00:03:45.750> they<00:03:46.049> don't<00:03:46.290> just

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
don't see hopefully they don't just

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.740 
don't see hopefully they don't just
stick<00:03:46.980> with<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.160> clock<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:48.299> yeah<00:03:48.420> man<00:03:48.630> the
