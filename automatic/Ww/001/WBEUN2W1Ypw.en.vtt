00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
we've sectioned the hair horizontally
and<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.869> separates<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.619> hair<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and this just separates this hair so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.710 
and this just separates this hair so
we're<00:00:29.250> able<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.640> neatly<00:00:29.880> wrap<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
we're able to neatly wrap it around the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
round the tongue closing it and then I'm

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.300 
round the tongue closing it and then I'm
working<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> head<00:01:07.470> into<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
working up the head into a kind of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.789

spiral curl leave in a little bit of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
spiral curl leave in a little bit of
just<00:01:14.340> drag<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.939> roots<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.259> get

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
just drag at the roots so I don't get

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.820 
just drag at the roots so I don't get
too<00:01:16.619> much<00:01:16.770> kick<00:01:17.070> from<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> hair<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:18.830> placing

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
too much kick from the hair just placing

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.090 
too much kick from the hair just placing
the<00:01:20.810> hair<00:01:21.810> around<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> tongue<00:01:22.409> gently<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the hair around the tongue gently so the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.359 
the hair around the tongue gently so the
heat<00:01:23.310> comes<00:01:23.580> through<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:26.220> I'm

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
heat comes through and then I'm

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.910 
heat comes through and then I'm
releasing<00:01:27.560> into<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:29.009> nice<00:01:29.250> spiral<00:01:30.180> curl

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
releasing into a really nice spiral curl

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.140 
releasing into a really nice spiral curl
so<00:01:31.920> I've<00:01:32.009> released<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.670> curl<00:01:32.880> from<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so I've released the curl from the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
so I've released the curl from the
tongue<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:37.009> wrap<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220

curl up take a Kirby grip and just hold

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.639 
curl up take a Kirby grip and just hold
it<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> hair<00:01:47.759> sets<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.270> place<00:01:48.649> I've

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it there so the hair sets in place I've

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.710 
it there so the hair sets in place I've
taken<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.399> horizontal<00:01:50.700> sections<00:01:51.509> I've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
worked up the head I've wrapped it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.609 
worked up the head I've wrapped it
around<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.060> tongs<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619

around the tongs just as we get to the
top<00:01:55.829> section<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.670> important<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> wrap<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
top section it's important to wrap it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.179 
top section it's important to wrap it
round<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> different<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.829> create<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
round in a different way so we create a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.469 
round in a different way so we create a
random<00:01:59.700> curl<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.869> opening<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> barrel

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
random curl I'm opening the barrel

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.530 
random curl I'm opening the barrel
popping<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> hair<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.790> wrapping<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.000> the

popping the hair in wrapping it all the
way<00:02:06.689> around

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
way around

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.090
