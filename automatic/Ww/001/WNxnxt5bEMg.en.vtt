00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.640 
temperature it's really really important
to<00:01:38.980> not<00:01:39.100> have<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.810> freezing<00:01:40.810> or<00:01:40.990> anything<00:01:41.380> so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
to not have it freezing or anything so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.930 
to not have it freezing or anything so
you<00:01:41.680> want<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:41.980> have<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.220> at<00:01:42.340> room<00:01:42.550> temperature

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
you want to have it at room temperature

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.510 
you want to have it at room temperature
just<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.480> lot<00:01:43.690> easier<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:44.290> do<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
just so it's a lot easier to do this

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.360 
just so it's a lot easier to do this
entire<00:01:45.940> process<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:47.080> decided<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.130> would<00:01:48.190> do<00:01:48.340> a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
entire process I decided I would do a

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.430 
entire process I decided I would do a
video<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.729> this<00:01:48.880> cake<00:01:49.420> just<00:01:49.780> because<00:01:50.229> it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
video on this cake just because it's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.160 
video on this cake just because it's
really<00:01:50.830> simple<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.520> easy<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.900> just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
really simple and easy and it's just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.230 
really simple and easy and it's just
with<00:01:53.290> two<00:01:53.560> main<00:01:53.860> ingredients<00:01:54.040> also<00:01:54.760> just

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
with two main ingredients also just

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.880 
with two main ingredients also just
something<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.750> could<00:01:55.990> put<00:01:56.260> together<00:01:56.350> really

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
something you could put together really

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.280 
something you could put together really
quickly<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.850> night<00:01:58.300> before<00:01:58.570> or<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.170> day

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
quickly the night before or the day

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830 
quickly the night before or the day
before<00:01:59.620> you<00:02:00.070> have<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.520> special<00:02:01.240> occasion<00:02:01.360> or

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
before you have a special occasion or

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.570 
before you have a special occasion or
something<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.979> just<00:02:03.130> want<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.430> pop

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
no one's going to see it so we don't

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.069 
no one's going to see it so we don't
have<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.150> worry<00:03:32.329> about<00:03:32.450> making<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.959> look

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
so I'm just going to exist and i'm just

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.629 
so I'm just going to exist and i'm just
going<00:06:41.039> to<00:06:41.099> kind<00:06:41.430> of<00:06:42.620> swizzle<00:06:43.620> it<00:06:43.950> on<00:06:44.099> just<00:06:44.460> like

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
going to kind of swizzle it on just like

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.909 
going to kind of swizzle it on just like
this<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:47.599> you<00:06:48.599> could<00:06:48.780> also<00:06:48.870> do<00:06:49.260> that<00:06:49.470> across

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
this and you could also do that across

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.640 
this and you could also do that across
as<00:06:50.280> well<00:06:50.750> so<00:06:51.750> just<00:06:51.780> going<00:06:52.080> to<00:06:52.169> do<00:06:52.260> it<00:06:52.380> the

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
as well so just going to do it the

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.980 
as well so just going to do it the
opposite<00:06:53.220> way<00:06:53.280> as<00:06:53.610> well<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:56.479> that's<00:06:57.479> it<00:06:57.750> so

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
opposite way as well and that's it so

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.940 
opposite way as well and that's it so
then<00:06:58.139> you're<00:06:58.229> going<00:06:58.320> to<00:06:58.380> put<00:06:58.560> it<00:06:58.650> in<00:06:58.770> the

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
then you're going to put it in the

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.100 
then you're going to put it in the
freezer<00:06:59.220> for<00:06:59.430> about<00:06:59.820> five<00:07:00.270> to<00:07:00.300> six<00:07:00.539> hours<00:07:00.720> and

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
freezer for about five to six hours and

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.560 
freezer for about five to six hours and
then<00:07:01.590> you're<00:07:01.710> done<00:07:01.740> and<00:07:02.280> that's<00:07:02.729> okay<00:07:03.000> so<00:07:03.120> I

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
then you're done and that's okay so I

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.740 
then you're done and that's okay so I
