line what does that mean to exercise the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.390 
line what does that mean to exercise the
systems<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.729> no<00:01:11.729> different<00:01:12.210> than<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:13.350> know

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
systems so no different than you know

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200 
systems so no different than you know
anything<00:01:14.400> else<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.970> sure<00:01:15.000> the

design<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.790> done<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.200> develop<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.680> rig

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
design is done now they develop a rig

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.219 
design is done now they develop a rig
where<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.460> put<00:01:20.700> their<00:01:20.850> system<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> they

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
where they put their system on it they

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
where they put their system on it they
drive<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.189> try<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> break<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
drive it they try to break it so it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
drive it they try to break it so it
really<00:01:24.750> performs<00:01:25.680> its<00:01:25.950> intended<00:01:26.250> function

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
really performs its intended function

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
really performs its intended function
and<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.200> ensuring<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.950> D

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and it's all about ensuring that they D

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
and it's all about ensuring that they D
but<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> parts<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.049> come<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
but it so that when the parts do come to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
but it so that when the parts do come to
us<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> final<00:01:32.220> line<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.579> come<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> us

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
us on the final line they come to us

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200 
us on the final line they come to us
with<00:01:33.930> confidence<00:01:34.579> what's<00:01:35.579> different<00:01:36.090> about

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
with confidence what's different about

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
with confidence what's different about
the<00:01:36.509> Lear<00:01:36.689> 85<00:01:37.110> compared<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> the

excited about that

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920 
excited about that
have<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.790> made<00:02:19.000> decisions<00:02:19.480> yet<00:02:19.690> about

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
have you made decisions yet about

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.110 
have you made decisions yet about
avionics<00:02:20.710> engines<00:02:21.070> those<00:02:21.280> kinds<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.670> things

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
avionics engines those kinds of things

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.210 
avionics engines those kinds of things
yeah<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.900> sure<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.560> all<00:02:23.770> those<00:02:23.950> decisions

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
yeah for sure so all those decisions

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.410 
yeah for sure so all those decisions
were<00:02:24.490> made<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.850> launched<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.270> program

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
were made when we launched the program

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.620 
were made when we launched the program
and<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:26.800> those<00:02:27.160> suppliers<00:02:27.640> are<00:02:28.120> coming<00:02:28.450> along

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
know engines engines are ready to ship

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.760 
know engines engines are ready to ship
to<00:02:33.520> us<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:33.760> final<00:02:34.120> line<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.470> we're

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
to us on final line you know so we're

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.890 
to us on final line you know so we're
very<00:02:35.920> excited<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:37.090> mentioned<00:02:37.480> during<00:02:37.600> your

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
very excited you mentioned during your

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.660 
very excited you mentioned during your
news<00:02:38.410> conference<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> things<00:02:39.520> that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
news conference one of the things that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.310 
news conference one of the things that
stuck<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.030> my<00:02:40.150> mind<00:02:40.360> was<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> fact<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.020> your

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
stuck in my mind was the fact that your

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.160 
stuck in my mind was the fact that your
entire<00:02:41.590> pressure<00:02:41.950> fuselage<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.970> one<00:02:43.810> part

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
entire pressure fuselage is one part

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.590 
entire pressure fuselage is one part
number<00:02:44.230> what<00:02:44.680> was<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> thinking<00:02:45.280> behind

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
number what was the thinking behind

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.530 
number what was the thinking behind
making<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.750> designing<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.040> way<00:02:48.540> yeah

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
making that designing that that way yeah

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.140 
making that designing that that way yeah
so<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> single<00:02:50.440> pressure<00:02:50.830> fuselage<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.970> is

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so a single pressure fuselage this is

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.450 
so a single pressure fuselage this is
where<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.780> take<00:02:53.620> composites<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
where you really take composites to that

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.000 
where you really take composites to that
next<00:02:54.640> level<00:02:54.990> if<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.080> take<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> traditional

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
next level if you take a traditional

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.260 
next level if you take a traditional
aircraft<00:02:57.190> you'd<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.730> hundreds<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
aircraft you'd have hundreds and

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.540 
aircraft you'd have hundreds and
hundreds<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.750> parts<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.260> fasteners<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.040> when

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
hundreds of parts and fasteners so when

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.220 
hundreds of parts and fasteners so when
you<00:03:00.670> start<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.360> start<00:03:01.540> design<00:03:01.930> in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
you start to really start design in

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.950 
you start to really start design in
composites<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.330> know<00:03:04.420> being<00:03:04.690> able<00:03:04.810> to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
composites it's you know being able to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.320 
composites it's you know being able to
develop<00:03:05.200> something<00:03:05.740> like<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.610> one<00:03:06.970> part

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
develop something like that in one part

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
develop something like that in one part
you<00:03:07.570> know<00:03:07.660> we<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:07.870> other<00:03:08.080> parts<00:03:08.560> on<00:03:08.740> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
you know we have other parts on the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.590 
you know we have other parts on the
aircraft<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.400> if<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.580> look<00:03:09.790> at<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.270> you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
aircraft that if you look at it and you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.960 
aircraft that if you look at it and you
were<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> do<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.260> metallic<00:03:11.740> you'd<00:03:12.610> have<00:03:12.760> two

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
were to do it in metallic you'd have two

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.630 
were to do it in metallic you'd have two
three<00:03:13.360> four<00:03:13.750> parts<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.770> again<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.190> all<00:03:15.340> about

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
three four parts so again it's all about

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.330 
three four parts so again it's all about
leveraging<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.780> technology<00:03:17.340> leveraging

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
leveraging the technology leveraging

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.320 
leveraging the technology leveraging
composites

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
composites

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.270 
composites
you<00:03:19.870> know<00:03:19.990> know-how<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.190> what

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
you know know-how and so this is what

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.130 
you know know-how and so this is what
we've<00:03:21.400> done<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.730> also<00:03:22.450> said<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.020> is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
we've done you also said that that is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.720 
we've done you also said that that is
going<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.440> continue<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.100> hand<00:03:24.520> laid

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
going to continue to be a hand laid

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.910 
going to continue to be a hand laid
product<00:03:25.270> through<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.080> entire<00:03:26.410> production<00:03:26.860> of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
product through the entire production of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.500 
product through the entire production of
the<00:03:26.980> aircraft<00:03:27.340> why<00:03:27.610> make<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.940> decision<00:03:28.390> to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
the aircraft why make that decision to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.760 
the aircraft why make that decision to
do<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> as<00:03:28.930> opposed<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> automating<00:03:29.680> that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
do that as opposed to automating that

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.700 
do that as opposed to automating that
process<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.630> type<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.930> technology<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.500> we

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
process the type of technology that we

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.430 
process the type of technology that we
chose<00:03:32.950> from<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.550> onset<00:03:34.060> was<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:35.140> ensure<00:03:35.410> that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
chose from the onset was to ensure that

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.170 
chose from the onset was to ensure that
it<00:03:35.620> continues<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:36.160> be<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> hand<00:03:36.580> lay-up<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.030> mean

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
it continues to be a hand lay-up I mean

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.910 
it continues to be a hand lay-up I mean
that<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:37.930> doesn't<00:03:38.140> lend<00:03:38.470> itself<00:03:38.620> to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
that it just doesn't lend itself to

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.460 
that it just doesn't lend itself to
automate<00:03:39.400> if<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.670> were<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.060> show<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:41.350> know

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
automate if I were to show you you know

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.680 
automate if I were to show you you know
how<00:03:41.710> this<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.100> laid<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:43.360> know<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
how this is laid up you know and the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.660 
how this is laid up you know and the
different<00:03:43.990> ply<00:03:44.230> sizes<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.460> plies

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
different ply sizes if all the plies

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
different ply sizes if all the plies
were<00:03:45.880> always<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.270> same<00:03:46.480> size<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.020> always

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
were always the same size and always

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.630 
were always the same size and always
went<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> same<00:03:47.800> place<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.340> could<00:03:48.460> think

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
went in the same place you could think

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.700 
went in the same place you could think
about<00:03:48.790> automating<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:50.140> know<00:03:50.230> all<00:03:50.410> the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
about automating but you know all the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.620 
about automating but you know all the
sizes<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.280> shapes<00:03:51.520> are<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> molds<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:52.480> on

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
sizes and shapes are the molds and so on

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.970 
sizes and shapes are the molds and so on
are<00:03:52.780> very<00:03:52.960> different<00:03:53.440> all<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.950> different

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
are very different all the different

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.740 
are very different all the different
plies<00:03:54.490> are<00:03:54.760> different<00:03:55.030> sizes<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.510> know

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
plies are different sizes you know

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.060 
plies are different sizes you know
there's<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:55.990> real<00:03:56.140> roadmap<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.740> get<00:03:56.890> through

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
there's a real roadmap to get through

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.030 
there's a real roadmap to get through
all<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:58.060> best<00:03:58.360> way<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.600> do<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.960> and<00:03:59.140> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
all that the best way to do it and the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.590 
all that the best way to do it and the
simplest<00:04:00.490> way<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.760> do<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.690> hand<00:04:02.020> lay-up

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
simplest way to do it is hand lay-up

development I tell you it's always a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.490 
development I tell you it's always a
race

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
race

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.990 
race
and<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.860> entry<00:04:27.130> into<00:04:27.310> service<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.790> expected

and that entry into service is expected
when<00:04:28.710> 2013<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.920> truck<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.390> you're<00:04:31.540> into

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
when 2013 on truck and so you're into

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.810 
when 2013 on truck and so you're into
the<00:04:32.050> very<00:04:32.380> first<00:04:33.100> beginnings<00:04:33.640> of<00:04:33.730> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
the very first beginnings of the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.940 
the very first beginnings of the
certification<00:04:34.510> process<00:04:34.680> yeah<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.800> in

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
certification process yeah so in

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.950 
certification process yeah so in
parallel<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.790> have<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.030> certify<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.510> product

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
parallel you have to certify the product

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480 
parallel you have to certify the product
so<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.260> lot<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.590> development<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.160> complete

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
so a lot of the development is complete

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.460 
so a lot of the development is complete
we're<00:04:40.120> now<00:04:40.240> making<00:04:40.450> parts<00:04:41.050> we're<00:04:41.260> going<00:04:41.380> to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
we're now making parts we're going to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.500 
we're now making parts we're going to
assemble<00:04:41.680> parts<00:04:42.190> in<00:04:42.340> parallel<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.240> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
assemble parts in parallel to that the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.490 
assemble parts in parallel to that the
structure<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.140> do<00:04:44.290> all<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
structure you have to do all the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.170 
structure you have to do all the
certification<00:04:45.160> testing<00:04:45.550> we're<00:04:45.730> doing<00:04:46.030> all

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
certification testing we're doing all

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.730 
certification testing we're doing all
that<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.630> then<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.320> course<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.590> got<00:04:47.710> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
that and then of course you got the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.400 
that and then of course you got the
flight<00:04:48.010> testing<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.570> lot<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.750> work<00:04:49.900> ahead

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
flight testing so a lot of work ahead

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.110
