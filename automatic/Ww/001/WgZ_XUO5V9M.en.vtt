 the time with its author so we

 are on the site in guild wars 2 on 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.850

 location and a video each time 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.880
 so with good music as I 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.040
 you said it a difficulty level 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.600
 the levels advise the rewards 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.070
 you can find if there are any 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.979
 additional explanations they are 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.810
 written here so it's in french but 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.250
 good I think if you are a language 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.979
 foreign you will understand enough 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.830
 easily thanks to the video and the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.300
 explanations that are put in bold and 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.770
 otherwise you have everything and that's it 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.940
 fills little by little so maybe 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.159
 that when you look at this 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 video if you look at it by a few 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.580
 days or later still I do not know 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 maybe they're red there all they 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 will all be forgiven and there is need to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.000
