toddlers as your baby starts to grow

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400 
toddlers as your baby starts to grow
once<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.760> gets<00:00:17.939> to<00:00:18.150> about<00:00:18.180> six<00:00:18.779> months<00:00:18.990> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
once it gets to about six months it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
once it gets to about six months it's
recommended<00:00:20.040> that<00:00:20.099> you<00:00:20.250> start<00:00:20.670> feeding<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
recommended that you start feeding the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.099 
recommended that you start feeding the
babies<00:00:22.320> solids<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.720> need<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
babies solids to do this you need to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.070 
babies solids to do this you need to
incorporate<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:26.369> different<00:00:26.880> food<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.600> time

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
incorporate one different food at a time

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.750 
incorporate one different food at a time
this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:30.420> easier<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.470> monitor

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
this is because it's easier to monitor

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.119 
this is because it's easier to monitor
whether<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.940> child<00:00:33.030> has<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.750> reaction<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> food

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
whether a child has a reaction to a food

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.930 
whether a child has a reaction to a food
if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.670> slowly<00:00:36.180> introduce<00:00:37.080> a<00:00:37.409> food<00:00:37.979> over<00:00:38.909> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
if you slowly introduce a food over a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.140 
if you slowly introduce a food over a
period<00:00:39.330> of<00:00:39.570> days<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.769> I<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:41.220> start<00:00:41.699> with

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
period of days so I would start with

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.229 
period of days so I would start with
something<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.500> pumpkin<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:44.610> stained

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
something like pumpkin and stained

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.770 
something like pumpkin and stained
pumpkin<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.170> three<00:00:46.409> or<00:00:46.559> four<00:00:46.589> days<00:00:47.150> if<00:00:48.150> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
pumpkin for three or four days if the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500 
pumpkin for three or four days if the
baby's<00:00:49.170> taking<00:00:49.440> well<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.339> you<00:00:50.909> can<00:00:51.150> then

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
baby's taking well to that you can then

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.469 
baby's taking well to that you can then
start<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.500> something<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.220> broccoli<00:00:53.729> if<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
start on something like broccoli if you

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.950 
start on something like broccoli if you
see<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.750> change<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.830> your<00:00:56.070> baby's<00:00:56.610> reaction<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
see a change in your baby's reaction to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.280 
see a change in your baby's reaction to
food<00:00:58.199> its<00:00:58.650> demeanor<00:00:59.129> or<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:01.409> way<00:01:01.589> it's<00:01:02.129> um

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
food its demeanor or the way it's um

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
food its demeanor or the way it's um
processing<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> food<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.610> we'll<00:01:05.880> know

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
processing the food you then we'll know

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
processing the food you then we'll know
that<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> broccoli<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> caused<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that it's the broccoli that caused the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
that it's the broccoli that caused the
reaction<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> pumpkin<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
reaction and not the pumpkin so it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
reaction and not the pumpkin so it's
important<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.719> until<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
important to do it this way until you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
important to do it this way until you
get<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> number<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.460> vegetables<00:01:16.549> incorporated

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
get a number of vegetables incorporated

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
get a number of vegetables incorporated
into<00:01:17.789> their<00:01:18.090> diet<00:01:18.390> once<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.679> about

eight<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.450> nine<00:01:21.659> months<00:01:22.159> you'll<00:01:23.159> have

not only meet at that stage or protein
whether<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.249> tofu<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.179> something<00:01:51.689> else<00:01:51.899> but

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you'll also start to introduce a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.809

different<00:01:54.990> texture<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.920> food<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
different texture of food and that's a

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.510 
different texture of food and that's a
chunky<00:01:57.420> style<00:01:57.749> texture<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.679> your<00:01:58.799> child<00:01:59.069> if

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
some toddlers will take to this and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.739 
some toddlers will take to this and
really<00:02:01.979> enjoy<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> difference<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.179> some

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
really enjoy the difference and some

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.709 
really enjoy the difference and some
toddlers<00:02:04.079> won't<00:02:04.619> try<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.819> get<00:02:05.999> too<00:02:06.299> upset

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
toddlers won't try not to get too upset

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.109 
toddlers won't try not to get too upset
about<00:02:07.490> whether<00:02:08.490> they<00:02:08.729> do

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
about whether they do

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.119 
about whether they do
or<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.200> stage<00:02:10.590> they've<00:02:11.009> got

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
or they don't at that stage they've got

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.690 
or they don't at that stage they've got
a<00:02:11.159> long<00:02:11.519> time<00:02:11.909> to<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.019> used<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.860> you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
a long time to get used to it and you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.930 
a long time to get used to it and you
can<00:02:14.909> slowly<00:02:15.530> introduce<00:02:16.530> those<00:02:16.830> things<00:02:17.280> it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
can slowly introduce those things it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.960 
can slowly introduce those things it's
still<00:02:18.330> really<00:02:18.690> important<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.610> they're<00:02:20.940> not

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
still really important to if they're not

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.839 
still really important to if they're not
taking<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.319> chunky<00:02:23.040> version<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.580> things

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
taking to the chunky version of things

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.730 
meat in at the end where it can retain
it<00:05:05.880> will<00:05:06.180> still<00:05:06.420> be<00:05:06.450> cooked<00:05:06.960> but<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.380> retains

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
the time hence the freezing so you you

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.960 
the time hence the freezing so you you
probably<00:06:35.480> need<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.230> make<00:06:36.740> perhaps<00:06:37.400> three<00:06:37.940> or

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970

my<00:07:34.130> advice<00:07:34.280> would<00:07:34.520> be<00:07:34.850> that<00:07:35.360> if<00:07:35.540> you're
