instance<00:00:43.320> did<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.460> 33<00:00:45.030> states

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
instance did you know that 33 states

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
instance did you know that 33 states
spend<00:00:45.780> more<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.110> each<00:00:46.500> student<00:00:46.950> than

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
spend more on each student than

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
spend more on each student than
California<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:49.050> almost<00:00:49.320> every<00:00:49.559> other

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
California and in almost every other

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.340 
California and in almost every other
state<00:00:49.850> teachers<00:00:50.850> teach<00:00:51.180> fewer<00:00:51.570> students<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
state teachers teach fewer students and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
state teachers teach fewer students and
each<00:00:52.829> student<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:53.850> attention

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
each student can get more attention

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
each student can get more attention
maybe<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.530> reason<00:00:55.770> why<00:00:56.039> California

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
maybe that's one reason why California

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
maybe that's one reason why California
students<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.420> perform<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.899> well<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.379> those

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
students don't perform as well as those

students don't perform as well as those
in<00:00:58.649> almost<00:00:59.070> every<00:00:59.520> other<00:00:59.550> state<00:00:59.930> why<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
in almost every other state why is this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.039 
in almost every other state why is this
who<00:01:02.309> decides<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:03.090> much<00:01:03.270> money<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.780> school

gets and how those funds are spent to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
where it goes let's look at why

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
where it goes let's look at why
California<00:02:24.900> schools<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:25.920> less

money than schools in other states one

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.160 
money than schools in other states one
big<00:02:29.310> reason<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.090> voters<00:02:30.480> passed<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.990> law

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
big reason is that voters passed a law

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.040 
big reason is that voters passed a law
called<00:02:31.380> proposition<00:02:32.250> 13<00:02:32.760> which<00:02:33.030> limited<00:02:33.840> how

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
called proposition 13 which limited how

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.110 
called proposition 13 which limited how
much<00:02:34.290> money<00:02:34.590> homeowners<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.430> businesses<00:02:35.880> had

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
much money homeowners and businesses had

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.840 
much money homeowners and businesses had
to<00:02:36.150> pay<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.600> property<00:02:37.140> taxes<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.340> reduced

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
to pay in property taxes this reduced

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.660 
to pay in property taxes this reduced
tax<00:02:39.360> money<00:02:39.660> for<00:02:39.990> funding<00:02:40.110> schools<00:02:40.670> voters

tax money for funding schools voters
then<00:02:41.910> became<00:02:42.240> worried<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.780> schools<00:02:43.170> were

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
then became worried that schools were

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990 
then became worried that schools were
getting<00:02:43.530> too<00:02:43.740> little<00:02:44.010> money<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.550> passed

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
getting too little money and passed

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.170 
getting too little money and passed
another<00:02:45.360> law<00:02:45.710> proposition<00:02:46.710> 98<00:02:47.100> which<00:02:47.910> makes

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
another law proposition 98 which makes

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
funding each year this amount is tied to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.070
