00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 greetings dear lovers of knitting 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.960
 today we will knit like this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.599
 beautiful relief pattern fit it very 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 just looks very nice on 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.720
 squatting on the nursery and styles I took not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.670
 thin and thick thread to be seen 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 here's a clear pattern you can knit and out 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.640
 thick yarn 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 but better if the thread is smooth 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.879
 for the sample we will need to dial 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:45.140
 the number of loops is a multiple of three and let's 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.140
 Let's see how this beautiful pattern fits. 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 this edge loop we remove and further 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:00.090
 knit 3 loops together for the back 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 wall of the front loop and do a cape and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 knit again together that is from 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 three loops we knit 3 loops 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.539
 remove and knit until the end of the series so 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.189
 way 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:23.280
 3 loops together behind the back wall 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.689
 knitting face do nakid and more 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.689
 just knitting facial 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.799
 repeat to end of row 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.260
 and the last 3 loops together behind the back 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 knotted front wall do nakidy and 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.910
 once again knit 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.130
 and edging and so we tied off the first 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.649
 row 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:13.190
 dodge or knit the second row 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.670
 edge remove and then we see here 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.790
 that we have 3 loops as they are 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.580
 separated the first two fri and we knit 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.030
 wrong side 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.370
 1 and 2 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.860
 next we will do the crossing here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.580
 the third loop and the first loop of these 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 three 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.140
 that is, we first knit the second 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:48.200
 back loop and then first loop 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:55.670
 purl and remove 1 purl and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:59.150
 again do the intersection the second I 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.489
 first and knit until the end of row 1 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:09.160
 wrong and do the crossing 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:17.870
 first we check the second and then the first 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:21.130
 1 purl and again crossing 2 and 1 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.130
 knit with purses 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.100
 and knit until the end of the row 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.890
 wrong and cross that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.690
 purl and first and at the end of the series we have 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.180
 there will also be 2 purl at the beginning 2 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:58.660
 purl and at the end 2 purl and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.750
 edge we further repeat with 1 row y 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.989
 we get such a beautiful one 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.989
