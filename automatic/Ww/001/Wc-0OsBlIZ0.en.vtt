two shapes in this so just like that
mongers<00:00:54.270> made<00:00:55.140> shape<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.190> going

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
mongers made shape and then we're going

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.890

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that's the next shape and that's an a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's the next shape and that's an a
minor<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.380> from<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> G<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.910> then

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
we're gonna go to still the mind shape B

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.070 
we're gonna go to still the mind shape B
minor<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.810> we've<00:01:22.050> gone<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.259> cheese<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> one

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
- and I'm now back to a major which is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.800 
- and I'm now back to a major which is
on<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.180> C<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.140> two<00:01:38.810> which

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
on to the a to the C and the two which

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.910 
on to the a to the C and the two which
is<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.440> D<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.729> both<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> minor<00:01:42.420> shape

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
is the D and then both a minor shape

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
is the D and then both a minor shape
which<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.340> E<00:01:44.369> minor<00:01:44.789> -<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.440> f

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
which is the E minor - up which is f

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.480 
which is the E minor - up which is f
sharp<00:01:46.649> minor<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.619> must

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
sharp minor and then back up one must

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.850 
sharp minor and then back up one must
achieve<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.600> G<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:54.229> which<00:01:55.229> starts<00:01:55.709> on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
achieve so that G there which starts on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.460 
achieve so that G there which starts on
the<00:01:55.950> 15th<00:01:56.459> fret

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.609 

12<00:02:00.470> frets<00:02:00.970> apart<00:02:02.230> for<00:02:03.230> not<00:02:03.380> G<00:02:07.990> major<00:02:08.990> minor

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619

12 frets apart for not G major minor
minor

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500 

so<00:02:18.010> really<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.820> take<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.300> down<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
so really if you just take it down to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.590 
so really if you just take it down to
one<00:02:19.690> string<00:02:20.310> starting<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.670> third<00:02:22.090> string

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
one string starting on this third string

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:36.480 
one string starting on this third string
on<00:02:22.740> six<00:02:23.850> right<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.510> your<00:02:34.960> G<00:02:35.350> major<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:36.190> we

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
on six right but is your G major and we

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.210 
on six right but is your G major and we
just<00:02:36.700> put<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.840> note<00:02:38.050> here<00:02:38.350> which<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.890> believe

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
just put this note here which I believe

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:51.530 
just put this note here which I believe
is<00:02:39.420> six<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.470> parts<00:02:41.920> makes<00:02:42.280> G<00:02:43.500> 676

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.890 

once<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.020> down<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:58.060> really<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
once you get that down then really you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.330 
once you get that down then really you
can<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.290> play<00:02:59.530> around<00:02:59.709> with<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.040> all<00:03:00.280> night

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
can just play around with it all night

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
can just play around with it all night

the<00:03:38.410> same<00:03:38.620> shape<00:03:38.890> which<00:03:39.850> was<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.239> G<00:03:40.830> major<00:03:41.830> and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310

the same shape which was the G major and
now<00:03:42.940> just<00:03:43.450> above<00:03:48.360> without<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.600> space

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:23.060 

Oh<00:04:14.640> started<00:04:15.640> here<00:04:16.200> which<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.560 

so<00:04:24.070> which<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.250> really<00:04:24.430> good<00:04:24.850> so<00:04:25.390> you<00:04:27.390> could<00:04:28.390> be

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
so which is really good so you could be

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.810 
so which is really good so you could be
a<00:04:28.600> couple<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:28.990> nice<00:04:31.500> entertainment<00:04:32.500> there<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
a couple of nice entertainment there and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.470 
a couple of nice entertainment there and
now<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.570> using<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.350> principle<00:04:35.590> though<00:04:36.480> go

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
now so using that principle though go

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.510 
now so using that principle though go
back<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.870> G<00:04:39.990> base<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.980> rather<00:04:44.980> than<00:04:45.160> using

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
back to the G base so rather than using

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.980 
back to the G base so rather than using
their<00:04:45.940> G<00:04:46.890> on<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.250> sixth<00:04:49.090> string<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.480> use<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.780> G

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
their G on the sixth string I use the G

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.110 
their G on the sixth string I use the G
on<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.170> first<00:04:50.470> string<00:04:50.770> still<00:04:51.640> using<00:04:52.000> the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
on the first string still using the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.370 
on the first string still using the
third<00:04:52.420> which<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.590> B<00:04:53.920> here<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:55.380> fourth

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380
