00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hey hop hulahup friends today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 look at the game of school moonshine with what I 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.790
 suddenly remembered about him this one because 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.210
 found scraps of a book 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 from dandy with secrets passwords and so 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.930
 further remembered that I had cartridges 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 Name only Amgun not amarone argun 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.580
 but in the book he was as well as she could and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.830
 telling there about the fact that a certain soldier 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.460
 crashed on an airplane and fell on an island 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 uninhabited yes and need to return to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 the other end of the island so that we see 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 rescue ship to escape 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.300
 This sharply escape than can 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 boast this toy first on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 oddity very bright colorful 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 the graphics are exactly colors bright as opposed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.460
 from the same does not tick it for example take 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.079
 where were the duller tones of the colors yes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 here of course red red green 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 light green that is all beautiful 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.250
 it looks purple and all that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.440
 so please but in this toy there is one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 a little flaw is that in this form 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 from how we are now to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.360
 in the form of Robinson Crusoe we are given 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.439
 a certain number of rounds 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.700
 as you see two hundred seventy three 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.280
 I have a cartridge left for my gun 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.950
 for my soldier rifle 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.890
 awesome and one touch ie if 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.210
 we are touched by the enemy then we all must 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.070
 start over naturally there is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 of course checkpoint save points but 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 they are very far therefore 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 not always understand and keeps a hold on there 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 so oh well some weird cats 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.600
 or what is this this bird flies on 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 bird it is understandable bird is understandable 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 the island always and the spokes of the role end 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.899
 unfortunately so now there will be something 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.020
 I remember a dangerous toy 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 remarkable because there is a good sound 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.610
 Well, I already said natural graphics as 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.219
 you can see for yourself 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.420
 flattened to and everything looks nice 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.939
 it is nice enough to always play 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 to the end and never did pass 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.650
 of course I had to go but of course 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.220
 it was not before 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.810
 Well, dandy may unfortunately not the most 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.010
 right moment grunted buy 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.870
 the other is somehow not really me and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.850
 counted so good but look here 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 these cartridges are of course beyond 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.350
 difficulties now although you can now all 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.610
 find but in general the hour is not particularly 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.610
 although I will try of course all this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.750
 to find it would be great with relatives 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.220
 frames to play right by the set-top box 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.860
 so I still remember how to play neatly 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.200
 passers-by look strange mushrooms some 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.200
 bouncing that is it almost jungle 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.080
 think will start it seems more 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.790
 it seems like some kind of leg 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.950
 I was afraid that here they are slippery 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.330
 movies and have to play first but 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.320
 not from the very beginning but still 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.959
 from a place where you donâ€™t really want 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.450
 so terrible mushroom this incomprehensible all 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.400
 well received by the way of management 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.530
 very responsive but sometimes it happens 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.020
 you move away 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.580
 in some places you leave the pebbles 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.610
 so sticking again legs legs so 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.560
 fine and by the way I took 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.200
 You have seen such an opportunity with 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.680
 cams with cams opportunity was 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.170
 such 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.480
 cam icon so here it gives you 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.970
 ability to turn into mega gonna 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.590
 as the super race books were written 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.600
 gaga he was like that in different versions was 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.210
 differently it meant everything but you 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.110
 how to turn super mega gonna here 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.480
 she let's try the rooms we are given in 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.240
 difference from our usual 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.310
 and Magona 5 strips of life that is us 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.810
 can beat five times well and respectively 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.220
 we have a special blow powerful look 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.750
 athletically kick no one 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.550
 opposes our superudar abundance 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.870
 of the backdrops of course is striking it very 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.360
 great done they are usually very beautiful 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.340
 first and original tac toy 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.460
 remembered not by the sound and sound 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.440
 the graphics of this one so it is in life 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.270
 excellent wading farther I 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.420

 I will receive necessarily seventy nine 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.970
 ammo remains need somewhere 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.650

 gets on that leg i mean it 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.460
 Of course, not a magician, this tree 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.500
 you already have to start 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.629
 first here it is sad give us 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.699
 Please, that's great, but why not? 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.039
 turns what we took here I don't know 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.800
 What can this hook be about? 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:26.909
 I'll even let you know some yes what is it 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:29.090
 this site has hesitated already so quietly so 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.349
 so but weird toy 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.909
 abounds of course because you scored here 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.710
 graphics and graphic elements but she 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.629
 does not blink first how can it be 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.120
 up by himself with many games due to 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.300
 that limits 8 sprites per line 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.300
 here it is all ingeniously done to me 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.259
 it seems very logical yes what is that 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.800
 that you divorced so much 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.800
 Extremely many wasps 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.500
 so well we need to eat 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.210

 Wow Wow Wow Wow, without ear. now 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.300
 starts to lag because a lot 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.190
 on the string of sprites if you understand about 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.810
 than me 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.130
 no ammo of course it's a trouble to play i 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.990
 I hope something works out for me 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:27.060
 now and here yes what is it that is 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.580
 I wanted to defeat him but probably game over 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.139
 fight yes yes game over 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.930
 Here is such a great toy we 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.550
 We looked briefly if I had 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.580
 there will be more desire possible 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.290
 will make news with her strip family 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.760

 the toy is really wonderful 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.630
 let's get at least 4 levels to which 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.919
 Maxim passed when we were not well 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.880
