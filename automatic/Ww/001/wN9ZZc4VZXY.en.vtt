to<00:01:16.680> aim<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.640> island<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.180> straight

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to aim for the island which is straight

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.899 
to aim for the island which is straight
over<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.830> try<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
over there we go try and get on to that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
over there we go try and get on to that
doorway<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.860> need<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> running<00:01:23.250> start

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
doorway you don't need a running start

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
doorway you don't need a running start
so<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.030> sure<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> you've<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.200> mount

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.710 

for<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.780> top<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> doorway

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710 

they'll<00:01:41.350> still<00:01:41.530> be<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.710> same<00:01:41.890> as<00:01:42.040> before<00:01:42.720> when

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
they'll still be the same as before when

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.140 
they'll still be the same as before when
you<00:01:44.190> midair<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:45.220> when<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.700> run<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.120> jump

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
you midair so when you run and jump

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.110 
you midair so when you run and jump
you're<00:01:47.110> gonna<00:01:47.200> hit<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.820> levitation<00:01:48.820> button

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
you're gonna hit that levitation button

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.540 
you're gonna hit that levitation button
while<00:01:49.330> you're<00:01:49.450> slow<00:01:49.690> fall<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:51.220> you're<00:01:51.430> gonna

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
while you're slow fall and you're gonna

it is we're going to take a running leap

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.570 
it is we're going to take a running leap
and<00:02:31.420> hit<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> limitation<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.890> your<00:02:33.040> slow<00:02:33.250> fall

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
and hit the limitation or your slow fall
