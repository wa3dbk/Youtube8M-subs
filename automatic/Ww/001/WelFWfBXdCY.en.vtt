00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.280
 tells crowd beauty all back this 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.099
 The staff will teach you how to 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.960
 ps4 control is now in the camera 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.550
 ps4 on pc 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 the first thing to do besides having the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.960
 control in your hand obviously is to have the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.670
 usb cable that connects to the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.539
 as soon as you connect the USB cable 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.519
 control 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.110
 it will be an orange light what it is 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.030
 important it will be lit at 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.890
 his battery take 100% in my case to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.830
 battery is fully charged. 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.659
 it simply connects the cable that came 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.250
 to carry the control you turn it on 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.930
 computer and now we are going to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 part of the computer that we need 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.799
 installing a stop to start is just 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.019
 you click on this one on this site that 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.320
 is here in the right description 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:00.729
 arriving there we will open this 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.040
 site beauty here entering this website 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.799
 that we have actually got nothing 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.860
 they will only need to get down to this game 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.270
 has multiple klien files in the last 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.530
 in which case it is a ds4 11.2 point 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.090
 2 probably download here 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.729

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.890
 Like it's because the day I 'm doing 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.109
