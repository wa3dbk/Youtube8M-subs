00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.670
 I have 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:14.799
 today I present a very original and refined way of cooking chicken on 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.980
 creamed chicken 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.500
 it is a very cheap second course home of chicken nuggets and mushrooms 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.850
 intrigued by a rich parma sauce, we see the ingredients together 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.929
 that we need to prepare it 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.949
 500 milliliters of chicken broth 600 grams of chicken breast an onion 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.380
 large a clove of garlic 3 4 sprigs of thyme 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.140
 sinappe morsels 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.120
 betex such 20 grams of flour 70 grams of butter 400 grams of champignon mushrooms 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.200
 beyoncÃ¨ tiny 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil a glass of 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.740
 white wine and 250 million fresh cream we prepare the very first chicken alla 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 cream 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 let's start preparing the creamed chicken by putting in a pan instead 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 large 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 30 grams of butter 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.020
 then add the onion and the chopped garlic let dry on low heat 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.090
 for about 10 15 minutes from the sea the onion must absolutely not take color 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 but they need only wither. becoming transparent 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.050
 at this point we would have paid chicken breast cubes in the meantime 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.450
 then add it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 Hospital 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.980
 let's raise the russia map and let it all brown for about 6 minutes 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 after which either sanremo and Donald Duck 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 VAT 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.869
 Now add the mushrooms that we have previously washed and cut into 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.060
 half 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.230
 and let it cook with cholesterol 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.800
 5 minutes after which we will add a glass of wine 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 then let it cook all over a low heat 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.600
 while the one with the mushrooms is cooking us sweetly in another pan 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.010
 we put 40 grams of remaining butter and flour 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.669
 let it all melt and when the flour becomes light brown 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.669
 we will add the chicken stock 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.769

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.749
 and then we can add 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 plastination 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.819
 the thyme leaves 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 continue the ball 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.960

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.190
