00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello and welcome to select 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 Let's have a look in this video 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.210
 how the new samsung galaxy note 3 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.279
 in the quadrant standard and in the tutu 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 benchmark against the also new sony 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 xperia z1 and then later in geekbench 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.350
 benchmark against the apple iphone 5 it so 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 always suggests the usual me 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.349
 have all three devices just new 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.820
 started up and their no 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.590
 running applications 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 I'll show you this quickly 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.480
 at note 3 and of course here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 sony xperia z1 i would say that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.910
 catch the same with the pure standard 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.270
 benchmark and click here directly 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.219
 Brilliant benchmark that was the wrong one 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.410
 button and then look which one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.329
 device at the end of the higher value spits out 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.949
 because that's what it's all about now 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.750
 I think also seen quite well have 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.090
 is the fact that the black forest 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 the note 3 is of course better 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 now quite interesting because we at 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.609
 both devices exactly the same cpu 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 it is the same with the qualcomm 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.740
 snapdragon 800 at the note 3 showed the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.080
 with 2 3 ghz at the xperia z1 with 2.2 ghz 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 in each case four cores, of course, but we 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 have 3 GB of RAM and the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.750
 xperia z1 we have two gigabytes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 random access memory 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.659
 I'm pretty much so now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.270
 curious you can always quite here 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.950
 Compare well the displays and where we are 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.350
 just when the black then you have to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.689
 say that the value at z1 of course 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.299
 better is both of us are done 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.430
 start with the xperia z1 and look 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 How much did you see? 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.939
 it is now 20 1557 a very strong value 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 will know quadrant stands and then 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.409
 Let's see what the note exchange 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.149
 has done and the top the whole 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.040
 Of course, I'll keep that to you 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.990
 also in 22,000 169 points really one 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 is priced very very strong 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.899
 probably then or that has 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.909
 probably to do with that the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.009
 clock frequency at note 3 just higher 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.960
 is what standard of choral and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.479
 benchmark 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.829
 and on in the tutu benchmark how it works 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.599
 are already mentioned in both the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.790
 latest version you can see here 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.620
 these funny comments on 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.200
 were introduced and we click now 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 at both on start test you know it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.069
 the tutu benchmark needed something 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.569
 lose longer than the others in this respect 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.170
 maybe a few words to mine 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.209
 first impression of the galaxy note 3 for 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.709
 I can no longer use xperia z1 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.450
 First impression because I have 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.939
 The device has been over two 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.459
 weeks in the test the review follows very 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.769
 very soon and to that extent would result to me 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.269
 just about the note 3 now what I 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.470
 I have to say that on the 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.420
 ifa mentioned is easy 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.859
 It is incredibly easy to have one here 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.510
 just do not feel the device with 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.220
 57 to have 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.980
 this is easier to handle than it is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.019
 the note 2 just real is pretty 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.000
 pretty well done by samsung too 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.230
 generally the space utilization if we 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.359
 now the two of us here in the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.790
 compare a 5 inch view here 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.379
 Display here have a 5.7 inch display 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.840
 and technically take the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.209
 both really not much or not so 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.000
 clear, you can see the difference 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.489
 but that sounds to me here too 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.769
 0 7 inches more this is just like when 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.680
 xperia z1 the frames got so thick 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.659
 whatever you notice is just this 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.699
 back this leather back when 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.370
 note 3 simply looks significantly more valuable 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.840
 I like it pretty well and that must 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.669
 Just say it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.590
 The display is also neat 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.329
 Serve mentioned on the ifa and also 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.040
 addressed in unboxing 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.780
 you hardly notice that he his 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.849
 commuter matrix is ​​either lying 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.859
 Actually on this lady and arrangement 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.859
 which one already had with the galaxy s 4 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.090
 I do not know about the display 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.310
 I really can not get that sharp 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.959
 complain 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.250
 Otherwise, as I said I can 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.750
 the two devices are doing quite well here 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.879
 Compare and always good 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.459
 they are also the differences here 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.319
 the contrast will be the displays 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.689
 Of course, this trier az 1 is clear 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.689
 more natural than the amoled display of the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.639
 galaxy note 3 whatever you have to say 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.769
 What occurs to me now again so even if 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.569
 I'm so off to the devices custom 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.009
 this is behind the camera now 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.620
 probably rather bad but the 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.659
 viewing angle stability is at note 3 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.699
 simply much better than the xperia 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.359
 z1 I'll try this here 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.430
 demonstrate 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.310
 I hope you can reasonably 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.830
 recognize as here simply xperia z1 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.689
 sometimes the colors are washed out 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.069
 is just a pity now says 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.409
 maybe one or the other good 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.090
 I'm just always watching on mine 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.639
 I think that's pretty much right 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.539
 Then you can take the bus or the train 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.479
 Subway etc 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.620
 not everyone is patting on my device 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.439
 Of course, that's right, but I have to say 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.819
 even in everyday life, I am quite normal 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.069
 the device I've looked at the 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.990
 viewing angle stability disturbed simply 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.539
 because you are not always 100 percent 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.210
 just looking at his device on it looks yes 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.219
 the band max progresses and that 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.680
 galaxy note 3 is already 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:05:00.360
 finished and has a very very strong 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.129
 worth 35,000 582 points 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.860
 I hope you can do this here now 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.139
 Really recognize very very strong 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.639
 and also the xperia z1 is ready 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.289
 also relatively strong with 23,000 867 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.509
 points but I have to be honest 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.539
 said a little more hoped for who the values 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.310
 from qualcomm snapdragon 800 I know 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.419
 do not know exactly what's going on there but me 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.789
 can only tell you i have, of course 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.740
 several tests performed and the z1 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.110
 mostly did not make it but 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.490
 well of course that's just benchmark that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.759
 It was now the title 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.830
 and last but not least now, too 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.810
 there is still a dispute benchmark because 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.250
 there we can do the iphone 5 it then 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.740
 Consult with equal 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.719
 before we start them now 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.819
 well worth a whisker 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.589
 comparison there can be the amoled display of 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.569
 note 3 just not with the two here 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.460
 keep up and I have to say that too 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.270
 iphone 5 it has a noticeable 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.219
 better value than the sony xperia z1 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.099
 few words to the iphone 5 we have it 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:01.860
 here the apple a7 dual core with 1 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.629
 gigabyte of RAM but also 64 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.580
 bit architektur so far it becomes now 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.250
 very interesting, I click at all 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960
 three to benchmark it is not so 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.270
 who is finished first but 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.310
 who at the end spits out the higher value 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.589
 the kven scream was also very new 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.830
 Revised shows many interesting 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:21.659
 things once the benchmark or that 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.719
 result with a processor and then 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.310
 also the sea ​​kernel result and we 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.500
 had no device with me here 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.409
 the qualcomm snapdragon 800 at the last 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.470
 benchmark comparison between iphone 5 s 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.150
 and iphone 5c or 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.220
 I think so the pain would have it 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.750
 so far that's going to be 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.340
 also pretty interesting and geekbench 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.450
 is always pretty fast 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.610
 we should now the same 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.230
 results have the iphone 5 it is 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.930
 finished I think you see is quite good 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.610
 once in 1416 once 2500 65 points 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.680
 definitely a very strong value 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.180
 Let's talk about the other two with the 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.310
 create snapdragon 800 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.090
 the need is not in the single core score 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:04.430
 as much as the apple iphone 5 but 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:07.010
 940 points but for the multi cores 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:11.200
 choor of course more, namely 2013 points 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:14.510
 the same applies to the xperia z 1 906 and 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.970
 2733 I think you see that very well 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.850
 So let's conclude 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.860
 These courses benchmark the test 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.020
 galaxy note 3 has it in the first 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.880
 benchmarks beaten absolutely sovereign 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.320
 but the other two have a lot 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.880
 very strong 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.130
 at this point, of course, how 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.290
 always these are just benchmarks it is a 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.060
 good guide but about the everyday 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.280
 Performance do not say too much 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.750
 which is much more important and how
