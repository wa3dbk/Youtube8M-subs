00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
reading magic mourns which is I think an

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.970 
reading magic mourns which is I think an
Andrea<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.120> Raphael<00:03:54.690> novella<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.560> believe

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
Andrea and Raphael novella I believe

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.850 
Andrea and Raphael novella I believe
this<00:03:56.340> novella<00:03:56.640> takes<00:03:56.940> place<00:03:57.299> between<00:03:57.630> book<00:03:58.350> 3

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
this novella takes place between book 3

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680 
this novella takes place between book 3
and<00:03:59.100> booked<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.730> Kate<00:03:59.910> Daniel<00:04:00.209> series

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
and booked for in the Kate Daniel series

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.199 
and booked for in the Kate Daniel series
so<00:04:01.140> ideally<00:04:01.890> I'd<00:04:02.160> like<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.579> read<00:04:02.730> both<00:04:03.000> of

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.000 
so ideally I'd like to read both of
those<00:04:03.420> but<00:04:04.110> if<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.320> can<00:04:04.500> only<00:04:04.680> read<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
those but if I can only read a

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.280 
those but if I can only read a
questionable<00:04:05.579> client<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.239> will<00:04:06.570> be<00:04:06.750> perfectly

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
