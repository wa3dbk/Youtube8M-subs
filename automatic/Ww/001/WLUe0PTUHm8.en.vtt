00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 now we are going to san lorenzo with 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.180
 violence in the bathroom we are live from 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
 the place we said an important 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.050
 intensity of rain this veteran 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.389
 of the embrace channel with background in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.030
 General San Martin and below our 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 pass the brook san lorenzo will see that the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 flow is really important and for 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 these hours is the transit totally 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.500
 cut here we are with some 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 responsible for the municipality of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 puerto general san martín good for 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 know in principle what is the danger 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 that is suffering in this place 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630
 and why it has definitely cut 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.780
 the transit to buendía returned to be good 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 had not not so much both the danger or 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.440
 whether the application has to exist 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 because today it is very large every 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.309
 day something that comes from both the stream 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 then the pressure that is causing the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.539
 running water that will start to barranca 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 all the work that was done 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.260
 approximately in 2004 with the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 neighborhoods in a job was made of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.730
 quite containment but it's so big 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.530
 the growing that came that the people do not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.070
 moved to all that and has a small 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.500
 displacement the slab that joins the bridge 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.030
 with the pavement that's why this one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 Take that precaution to be able 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 and fluid that a thing does not happen a danger 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.390
 older that has a lot of transit to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 liver many people who circulate from san 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 lorenzo towards puerto general san martín 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.649
 it is logical we are really industrial and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 at the peak and impressive time of 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.240
 transit that has this bridge has 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.210
 but at this moment the executive is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.930
 in the tasks of communicating with 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.940
 hydraulic engineering of the province 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 so that it comes we are waiting for a 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.380
 hydraulic engineer of the province 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.300
 so that it comes to evaluate the damages of the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 bridge base the bridge was made to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.570
 it had been a contention 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.210
 with gabions and cement but good 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380
 bad guys unfortunately 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.619
 deteriorated by cutting the wires and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.409
 we had stone losses at the base of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.720
 the containment of the bridge and the water 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.360
 it undermined the earth and this happened what 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.000
 happened we hope to have hopefully have 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.190
 patience is not great is not dangerous 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 as many say but caution 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.049
 the executive in all work is this and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 it is better to cut and prevent than not 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.550
 regret after 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.110
 what is what is the other access then 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.420
 what do people who want to transit 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.800
 from san lorenzo to puerto general 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.180
 san martín today we all ask 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 collaboration to the people that the only 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.750
 access that you have is the number more if 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.920
 he has to be working on the sspe 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.840
 It has only one hand and it has to be 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.190
 patient when I enter and leave 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.900
 port or to enter port san martín 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.990
 gracefully, it's the only one we have 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.210
 because the other bridge that crosses by route 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.350
 11 is also because it is closed and it is 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.790
 the only access that has to them 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.010
 we ask people to be a little 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.930
 prudent to be aware that there 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.460
 operatives that are doing it for that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.140
 for caution then exclusively 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.300
 caution nothing more 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.130
 very good to susana if it happened then the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.110
 word of two employees who form 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 part of the port municipality 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.760
 General San Martin then attention with 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.100
 this bridge that connects to the city of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.730
 san lorenzo with port as we were 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.700
 commenting the detour is by the bridge 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.480
 homero manzi 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.280
 thank you fine until then danger 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.650
 then in san lorenzo and in port 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.140
 San Martin came through 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.040
 from the increase in water flow 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.040
 of the brook san lorenzo
