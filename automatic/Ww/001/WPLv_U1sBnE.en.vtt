00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and ended up being better than expected

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.889 
and ended up being better than expected
so<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.730> sort<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.120> good<00:01:00.300> start<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.780> got

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so that was a sort of good start it got

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
so that was a sort of good start it got
me<00:01:01.050> moving<00:01:01.320> quite<00:01:01.620> quickly<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.370> after

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
me moving quite quickly then after

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
me moving quite quickly then after
finishing<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> book<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
finishing that book I for I think of a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
finishing that book I for I think of a
graphic<00:01:04.830> novel<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.939> Ricky<00:01:06.240> browse

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
graphic novel and that was Ricky browse

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
graphic novel and that was Ricky browse
has<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> gun<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.170> Georgia<00:01:07.650> telling<00:01:07.950> John<00:01:08.100> eggs

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
has a gun by Georgia telling John eggs

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.750 
has a gun by Georgia telling John eggs
and<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:09.420> managed<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.400> far

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and I only managed to get about that far

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
and I only managed to get about that far
in<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> quarter<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.290> realized

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
in so like a quarter and I just realized

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.350 
in so like a quarter and I just realized
it<00:01:13.860> wasn't<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> felt<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.030> reading<00:01:15.270> at

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it wasn't what I felt like reading at

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.960 
it wasn't what I felt like reading at
the<00:01:15.390> time<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.939> then<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the time so I put that down then I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.140 
the time so I put that down then I
picked<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.640> short<00:01:21.090> story

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
picked up I think the first short story

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
picked up I think the first short story
in<00:01:21.869> bobcat<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.350> other<00:01:22.530> stories<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in bobcat and other stories and that was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
in bobcat and other stories and that was
about<00:01:23.430> 27<00:01:24.060> pages<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> read<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
about 27 pages so I read that and
