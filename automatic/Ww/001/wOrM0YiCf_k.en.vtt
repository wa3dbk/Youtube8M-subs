half<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.809> some<00:00:48.809> sometimes<00:00:49.559> quite

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
half and some sometimes quite

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
half and some sometimes quite
convincingly<00:00:50.280> whereas<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> teams<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
convincingly whereas the teams in the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
convincingly whereas the teams in the
top<00:00:51.750> six<00:00:52.050> they've<00:00:52.230> been<00:00:52.350> really<00:00:52.590> poor<00:00:52.890> against

Aston<00:00:54.030> Villa<00:00:54.059> being<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> bottom<00:00:54.570> after<00:00:54.719> him<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
Aston Villa being a bottom after him I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.420 
Aston Villa being a bottom after him I
think<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:56.160> win<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
think that just you know will win this
