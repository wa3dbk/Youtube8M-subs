00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.490
 Hi everyone then this video is everything 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.460
 an excuse to wish you happy holidays 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.340
 case I can't load another 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.830
 video by the end of the month and I wanted to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.350
 really to wish you a 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.449
 very happy christmas and let's go to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.570
 make really chocolates 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.960
 very very simple just like 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.030
 gift idea for Christmas and we will need it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 so chocolate in my case 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 used the one at the act 100 grams 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 then it depends on the amount of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.000
 chocolates you need to make for 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 the filling instead opted loses Carmelo e 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.300
 used this here ready of the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.600
 blacksmiths and then of course I used 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.030
 the inevitable spreadable chocolate 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 we will obviously need a mold 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 the better you used this yes 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 chases because they are much much more 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.769
 simple for the realization of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 chocolates at home and like this a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.840
 all the Christmas forms we choose the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.700
 bain-marie chocolate 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.260
 we cut to fill our supplies 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 we will have to make sure that the chocolate 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 from risca to the base and the walls of each 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.040
 so it will only take us one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.040
 teaspoon and a little patience 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 as soon as we finish we do 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.170
 rest the mold in the fridge for an hour 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.290
 or in the freezer like I did for 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 about half an hour 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.520
 and here all is cooled to 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.800
 this point we can give to realize 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
 our filling for some like 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.250
 early first opted for del 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.630
 caramel 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.720
 if you don't have it ready you can 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.820
 prepare it because it's really simple 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.490
 while for others I used the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.260
 simple spreadable chocolate 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.369
 obviously chocolates with caramel 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.540
 they will have a more liquid filling while 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.450
 those with chocolate cream 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.160
 they will have a more solid filling 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.790
 as soon as we finished we do 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 rest in the fridge again this time a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.820
 couple of hours in the fridge for an hour in 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.490
 freezer 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.590
 and here is our veil mold 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.840
 cooled and we go to make the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.760
 our chocolates base will serve us 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.610
 simply a teaspoon ed 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.270
 obviously the melted chocolate a 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.280
 Bain-marie then maybe we also use 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.530
 a spatula like I did so for 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.810
 reveal the basis of each chocolate 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.989
 once finished we will rest 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.870
 for the last time a couple of hours in 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.269
 fridge or freezer 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.790
 and here they are ready packed videos 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:03:00.320
 inside a cardboard box 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 with golden cups and nothing if you are 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.500
