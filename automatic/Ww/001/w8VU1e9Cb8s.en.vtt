00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.809
 in the central part that is the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.120
 responsible for giving the whole device 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.009
 stretch to handle all systems 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 electric and durable with tire like 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.239
 corresponds to all the faults that go 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.009
 leaving so that the commander can 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.349
 keep flying is the responsibility of 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.060
 engineer the resolution in coordination 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.669
 with the co-pilot and together with the others 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.439
 crew members each of 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.439
 those who are here that make up the 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.359
 crew as the ship the copilot the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.170
 Engineer is not electronic charging 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.059
 on board 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.030
 they are all this important parts 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.739
 of the plane that because they leave most of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.960
 the cases are not reached 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.460
 determine the faults well and through 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.230
 things that you can get a better 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.570
 information to take a good 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.810
 decision is continuous from the garden 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.309
 this good is the central part of 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.160
 board is divided into the top 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.989
 with all the pneumatic system we have 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.090
 there an attachment that has been modified 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.800
 now we have the system 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.290
 air conditioning pressurization that is 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.970
 this we have the melting system and 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.910
 anti and in what corresponds to all this 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.530
 side later we have everything here 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.470
 what is the electrical system that is 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 as the nervous system of the apparatus with 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.960
 All the valves of all 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.500
 oil fuel control 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.660
 hydraulic and so on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.910
 after the electrical system we have the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.680
 fuel system the system 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.140
 fuel is organized in a way 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 than with any tank of any 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.600
 position can feed the engines 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.900
 we have four engines but we have 1 2 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.660
 3 4 tanks by which they are in the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.369
 part of below that are destroyed as 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 either because they look like bombs in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 reality they are fuel tanks 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.470
 externally this are organized les 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 I said it is that you can feed from 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.240
 a cross way if this tank 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.119
 number 1 the number quartz motor and vision 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.759
 is possibly the metal of yellow is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.460
 the indication system board 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.380
 fire over there is going to present us with a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.539
 game something we will be able to observe 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.360
 there and we can control it from that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.489
 point possibly the last board that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.320
 is at the bottom is for the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.600
 start-up on the plane for the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.330
 controls from there for her are the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.340
 start-up controls these 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.410
 they are insulating valves in case of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 that we have hydraulic loss in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.830
 some of our 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.400
 this system is the primary control 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.080
 we can isolate him to be able to follow the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 flight that was what I told them below 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.209
 these are some chill fins 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.530
 for engines today are the most culÃ©s 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.540
 well the flags alcohols that are the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.020
 fins and that's how it's organized 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.850
 now we have the fms 2 system 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.340
 that correspond to these six screens 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.900
 in which the external screens 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.780
 is where the information of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.670
 navigation and the main data for 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.590
 the flight speed altitude climb east 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.270
 and all the related data on 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.040
 next is for navigation itself 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.520
 which is the one where it is shown on the route 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.810
 from the points the filters the edges 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.810
 so that the aviator is doing his 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.540
 route this is through these systems 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.190
 the one below are the beings with these 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.569
 they are entered the information so that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.150
 can be presented on the screen 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.180
 the levers correspond to the systems 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 of engine control where the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 four left levers correspond 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.689
 to the accelerators and the other four 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.849
 Numbered levers are called 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.459
 levers of engine condition and the 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.670
 condition is only turned off 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.530
 and profiling and then the propellers that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.530
 they are the four levers on the side 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.019
 left in yellow is that for 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.269
 used as the accelerators and we have 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.000
 a constant speed motor of 13 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.799
 thousand 820 revolutions per minute then 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.489
 this the propeller that we have is a 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.409
 hamilton standard angle reversible and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.030
 with that you control the step ahead 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.689
 then that is the accelerator 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.430
 properly and with this one controls the 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.450
 engine power in the back 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.690
 we have the punctual 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.239
 what is the autopilot in the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.190
 head control radar control 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.359
 of the flaps the control of the radios and 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.169
 basically that's how it's organized 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.169
 our cabin 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.500
 as in action
