mages<00:03:10.740> thinking<00:03:11.040> off<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.580> score<00:03:11.820> for<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.150> your

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
mages thinking off the score for as your

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.470 
mages thinking off the score for as your
drake<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.720> nice<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:13.140> safe<00:03:13.350> but<00:03:14.340> alas<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
drake is nice and safe but alas the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.350 
drake is nice and safe but alas the
answer<00:03:15.750> Drake<00:03:15.990> isn't<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.970> at<00:03:18.150> least

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
answer Drake isn't it one and at least

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.380

that<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:34.350> arcane<00:03:34.800> missiles<00:03:35.270> missed<00:03:36.270> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
that the arcane missiles missed the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.920 
that the arcane missiles missed the
Incan<00:03:36.690> watcher<00:03:37.190> which<00:03:38.600> did<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.750> may<00:03:39.900> just

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
Incan watcher which did this may just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.699 
Incan watcher which did this may just
may<00:03:40.620> means<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:42.360> gonna<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:42.690> hit<00:03:44.450> okay

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
may means that it's gonna get hit okay

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.740 
may means that it's gonna get hit okay
so<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> mage<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.209> really<00:03:48.570> don't
