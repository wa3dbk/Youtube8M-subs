organic<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.960> mean<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> cases

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
organic I mean I think in a lot of cases

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.800 
organic I mean I think in a lot of cases
especially<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.420> you're<00:01:30.540> dealing<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
especially when you're dealing with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.039 
especially when you're dealing with
cinematic<00:01:31.939> situations<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.540> usually

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
cinematic situations they usually

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
cinematic situations they usually
audition<00:01:34.890> people<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.280> come<00:01:35.490> together<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> see

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
audition people to come together to see

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
audition people to come together to see
if<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> already<00:01:37.680> had

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
if they have it he and I already had

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
if they have it he and I already had
that<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.549> had<00:01:38.670> already<00:01:38.850> put<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that because we had already put in the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
that because we had already put in the
time<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.320> takes<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
time that it takes to have a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
time that it takes to have a
relationship<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.119> Martin<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.049> Lewis<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
relationship like Martin and Lewis and
