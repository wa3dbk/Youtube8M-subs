00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.900 
about i guess the great figure overall i
kept<00:02:28.080> taking<00:02:28.440> these<00:02:28.590> little<00:02:29.220> black<00:02:29.370> dots<00:02:29.670> here

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
kept taking these little black dots here

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.970 
kept taking these little black dots here
on<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> boots<00:02:30.390> i<00:02:30.780> kept<00:02:31.410> thinking<00:02:31.470> those<00:02:31.800> were

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
on the boots i kept thinking those were

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.580 
on the boots i kept thinking those were
like<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.460> paint<00:02:33.270> mess<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> package<00:02:34.260> but

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
like a paint mess up in the package but

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
like a paint mess up in the package but
i<00:02:35.040> was<00:02:35.490> looking<00:02:35.730> online<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.390> other<00:02:36.570> other

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
i was looking online and other other

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.050 
i was looking online and other other
pictures<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:38.190> all<00:02:38.370> seem<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.910> like

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
pictures and they all seem to be like

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.720 
pictures and they all seem to be like
that<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.980> looks<00:02:40.980> kind<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> weird<00:02:41.280> because<00:02:41.520> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that so looks kind of weird because it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.800 
that so looks kind of weird because it
just<00:02:41.820> kind<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.330> odd<00:02:42.480> shapes

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
just kind of like some odd shapes

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.520 
just kind of like some odd shapes
circles<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.490> boots<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.290> they<00:02:46.290> pretty

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
circles on the boots but they pretty

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
circles on the boots but they pretty
much<00:02:46.620> all<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> figures<00:02:47.310> are<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.940> if

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
much all the figures are like that if

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.030 
much all the figures are like that if
you<00:02:48.960> have<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> figure<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.620> doesn't<00:02:49.920> have

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you have a figure that doesn't have

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.340 
you have a figure that doesn't have
those<00:02:50.220> let<00:02:50.460> me<00:02:50.550> know<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.270> just<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.600> curious<00:02:52.170> to

individually which is pretty cool and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.350 
individually which is pretty cool and
the<00:03:19.770> thumb<00:03:19.980> doesn't<00:03:20.130> move<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.580> stationary<00:03:21.150> and

hand is the same articulation and he has

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.380 
hand is the same articulation and he has
a<00:03:27.840> okay<00:03:28.740> torso<00:03:29.400> joint<00:03:29.640> moves<00:03:29.880> side<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> side

a okay torso joint moves side to side
pretty<00:03:30.720> good<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:32.450> doesn't<00:03:33.450> really<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:33.780> up<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
pretty good but doesn't really go up and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.310 
pretty good but doesn't really go up and
down<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:36.000> what's<00:03:36.180> weird<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.690> see<00:03:36.959> he<00:03:37.170> had

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
down but what's weird is you see he had

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.010 
down but what's weird is you see he had
that<00:03:37.530> torso<00:03:37.830> joint<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.300> then<00:03:39.450> he<00:03:39.570> still<00:03:39.810> has

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
that torso joint but then he still has

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.000 
that torso joint but then he still has
the<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:42.510> other<00:03:42.660> torso<00:03:43.110> joint<00:03:43.380> right<00:03:43.740> below

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the the other torso joint right below

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.470 
the the other torso joint right below
that<00:03:44.630> where<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.750> does<00:03:46.080> go<00:03:46.290> up<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.590> down<00:03:46.740> as

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
that where it does go up and down as

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.680 
that where it does go up and down as
well<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:49.110> waist<00:03:49.380> swivel<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:51.270> he's<00:03:51.480> got

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
well as the waist swivel so he's got

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.510 
well as the waist swivel so he's got
actually<00:03:52.200> three<00:03:52.470> joints<00:03:52.890> right<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> torso

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
actually three joints right in the torso

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360 
actually three joints right in the torso
which<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.360> crazy<00:03:54.540> because<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:55.830> know<00:03:55.920> normally

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
which is crazy because you know normally

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.240 
which is crazy because you know normally
it's<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.750> always<00:03:58.260> joining<00:03:58.830> than<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.130> of

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
it's just always joining than one of

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.990 
it's just always joining than one of
these<00:03:59.340> two<00:03:59.610> maybe<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:00.870> pretty<00:04:01.080> cool

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
these two maybe so that's pretty cool

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.110 
these two maybe so that's pretty cool
and<00:04:03.000> he<00:04:03.120> has<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.660> ball<00:04:03.990> jointed<00:04:04.290> thigh<00:04:05.120> double

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
and he has a ball jointed thigh double

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.190 
and he has a ball jointed thigh double
jointed<00:04:06.390> knees<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:09.090> swivel<00:04:09.690> at<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.959> top<00:04:10.170> of

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
jointed knees and a swivel at the top of

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.580 
jointed knees and a swivel at the top of
the<00:04:10.410> boot<00:04:11.510> back<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.690> forward<00:04:12.930> pivot<00:04:13.080> at<00:04:13.320> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the boot back and forward pivot at the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.220 
the boot back and forward pivot at the
ankle<00:04:14.280> as<00:04:14.459> well<00:04:15.060> as<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.330> side-to-side<00:04:15.690> pivot

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
ankle as well as the side-to-side pivot

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.159 
ankle as well as the side-to-side pivot
and<00:04:16.880> then<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.060> little<00:04:18.299> joint<00:04:18.660> at<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.959> back<00:04:19.140> of

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
and then the little joint at the back of

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.969 
and then the little joint at the back of
the<00:04:19.380> foot<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.900> kind<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.440> double<00:04:22.800> toe

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
the foot and then kind of double toe

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.490 
the foot and then kind of double toe
joints<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.520> he's<00:04:23.820> got<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.300> joint<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.229> mexis

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
joints like he's got the joint the mexis

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.170 
joints like he's got the joint the mexis
toes<00:04:25.710> go<00:04:25.950> down<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.400> up

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
toes go down and up

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.420 
toes go down and up
and<00:04:27.300> then<00:04:27.720> he<00:04:27.840> actually<00:04:28.050> has<00:04:28.410> individual<00:04:29.160> toe

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and then he actually has individual toe

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.610 
and then he actually has individual toe
joints<00:04:29.850> which<00:04:30.449> is<00:04:30.630> crazy<00:04:30.900> I've<00:04:31.169> never<00:04:31.199> seen

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
joints which is crazy I've never seen

that it really spins but I mean you can

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.480 
that it really spins but I mean you can
get<00:04:59.759> it<00:04:59.849> around<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.240> my<00:05:00.270> position<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.870> want<00:05:01.490> so

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
I don't really know if that can just

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.560 
I don't really know if that can just
consider<00:05:04.410> articulation<00:05:05.160> or<00:05:05.280> not<00:05:05.460> as<00:05:06.270> far<00:05:06.539> as

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
consider articulation or not as far as

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.189 
consider articulation or not as far as
points<00:05:06.990> good<00:05:07.639> but<00:05:08.639> definitely<00:05:09.509> a<00:05:09.539> cool<00:05:09.810> figure

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
points good but definitely a cool figure

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.469 
points good but definitely a cool figure
really<00:05:11.009> if<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.820> guys<00:05:11.940> don't<00:05:12.000> have<00:05:12.270> this

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
really if you guys don't have this

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.700 
really if you guys don't have this
figure<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.900> really<00:05:13.110> need<00:05:13.259> to<00:05:13.349> pick<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.620> up

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
figure you really need to pick it up

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.430 
figure you really need to pick it up
it's<00:05:14.160> definitely<00:05:14.610> worth<00:05:14.759> it<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.199> was

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
it's definitely worth it so that was

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.210
