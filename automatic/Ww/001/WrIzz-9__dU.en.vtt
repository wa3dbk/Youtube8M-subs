00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 that's autumn is settling we are not 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.920
 sheltered from a small jelly ward a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 fat frost it's time to protect 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.460
 our plans 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.680
 for one of the best protections for 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.820
 protect our plants of course this 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.950
 are the leaves but we can also 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.570
 protect these plants with others 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.990
 ingredients and especially with sails 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.900
 wintering 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.099
 we are going to protect an aroma since the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 rom may also freeze during 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.029
 winter but before protecting it 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.220
 there is a little trick we will take 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.840
 a piece of ryzom so as to put it 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.460
 in a pot like that we do not put all his 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.350
 eggs in the same basket and year 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 next if this aroma the age she is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.250
 very high rank - an aroma on the inside 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.590
 so how do we do we take a 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.550
 knife with a long blade and we're going 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.320
 try to remove a piece of ryzom 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.440
 then a piece of ryzom that is at the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:54.650
 base so here with that we will be able to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.769
 just recover it's a rom that we 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.850
 will put in a pot we put aside 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.799
 now that we have been saved 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.780
 sort of furniture since we took a 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.170
 piece of ryzom we will protect our 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.820
 aromas 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.830
 I chose to use a veil 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.390
 wintering we could have used 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 leaves or dry ferns 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.469
 so the goal is to develop the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.869
 strain so that the jelly does not 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.700
 do not enter an inside of the road 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.049
 then there are still some leaves 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.750
 since there is not enough frozen 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.450
 so it can be interesting to leave 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.820
 like that now and why not with 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.679
 the leaves that will overtake and at 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 when it's going to freeze strongly at this 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.590
 moment there put all flower a little bit 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.119
 more strongly 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.079
 the big problem the big worry that we 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.509
 have during the winter it's not 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.280
 inevitably the jelly is the moisture is 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.490
 what I propose to you is the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.439
 protect with two tiles 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.200
 extra over it will avoid 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.929
 the humility to go inside 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 that's how we can protect a flavor 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.700
 so now we have our little 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.770
 aromas 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.409
 we are going to win it now 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.259
 are we going to transplant this piece of ryzom 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.950
 and I mean this piece of ryzom 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.569
 this aroma 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.249
 so we just took a whole 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.109
 little bit but that's enough it's 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.819
 enough so I may have done a 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.950
 little little stupidity I cut the 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.800
 sheet by taking out but it's not 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.360
 serious 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.670
 since we will be able to europe in t2 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.940
 this way the ideal is to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.930
 choose a potting soil green plants or a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.940
 horticultural interrogator a good potting soil 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.830
 or anyway and then we will put 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.820
 the roots and the rhizome are too 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.040
 interest here is now our 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.480
 aromas and sound and go over there it is 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.800
 sees practically no leaves and I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.940
 can you make sure within a week or 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200
 two he'll start seeing leaves 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.850
 so that's of course you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 you can put it indoors at 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.060
 the light you are well watering them the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.620
 leaves will develop 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.810
 and when the leaves are going 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.390
 develop when it will be raining 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.070
 there will definitely be a small 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.570
 droplets of water that will form on 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.640
 the end of the sheet and there you 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.380
 are sure that within twelve hours he's going 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.300
 rain and it's also for this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.780
 reason that is called art or plant 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.780
 barometer
