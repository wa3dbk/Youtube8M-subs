00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.850
 what a beautiful mattress 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.269
 well guys that was sher talking to you 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.619
 and today I came back with this new one 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.119
 video 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.710
 then today 's video is a video 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.899
 quite special because as you will have 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.110
 read from the title this video is indeed 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.129
 a world record of call of duty 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.129
 cost 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.720
 then I'm 99 per cent 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.350
 this is a world record because I have 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.239
 done before a search on youtube is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.300
 precisely this should be the first 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.290
 quad team that and strike that is now for 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.859
 who had not understood 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.890
 I explain you practically in this game 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:02.500
 we were playing in groups of five and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.850
 I velox karma and mancu we pulled 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.280
 all a cam strike and in the same 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.160
 so I am playing in the same game 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.200
 4 team strike games have been shot 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.369
 that is, it is not that I pulled 4 but that 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.509
 but each one of you pull to one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.479
 just like I said we were playing 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.670
 in five it was a pity because that is 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.440
 if he had also thrown the fifth the kehm 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 strike would have been really absurd 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.009
 but also one that is 4 that I strike in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.470
 a lot are not few anyway a 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.350
 part this in this game 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.399
 practically the velox was in fact 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.310
 inside cod 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.930
 he was recording a video live 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.950
 in description I will leave you the link of 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.860
 that video 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.890
 so if you want you can watch the cam 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.960
 who pulled him from his view and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.730
 you will still feel the reactions in the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.190
 moment in which we will pull all four 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.820
 the cams so if you want the link will be in 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.980
 description passed from the video anyway 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.470
 having said that the class you are using 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.550
 as you can see it was a hood 12 with 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.619
 increased charger and silencer yes 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.540
 just as you can see I have just 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.390
 magician I seem to be at 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.230
 level 20 of the first prestige then 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.860
 let's say it was a class made a bit 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.630
 so a little to the case in fact us why 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.490
 I was using I will tell you it was an extraction 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.550
 rapid predator readiness 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.320
 concentration is inflexible yes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.910
 they should be these 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.950
 then he has another thing as you can 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.920
 note precisely I was using support e 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 not so specialist in order to help 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.150
 the others too 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.670
 however, it was also useful support 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.230
 in fact I used the set with jackets and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.630
 the oracle that is the oracle I do not 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 I want to talk because one is too strong 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.000
 exaggerated strip, however, precisely 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.400
 having said that I wanted to talk to you for a moment 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 of something then practically in 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 these days on so many of them spinning 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.200
 strike but really so many for reasons 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.590
 absurd as for example very often me 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.390
 kill from behind with the knife 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.770
 a couple new good happened to me a lot 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.530
 but a couple of times often happened to me 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.640
 times of dying above 20 there are from 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.230
 behind with the knife 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.440
 that is, in this game the knife is 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.090
 really cool because you barely see yourself 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.640
 turn a corner if there is an enemy he will 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.530
 stabbed immediately, however, I am not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 accustomed by the stab wounds because I don't 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.280
 like it doesn't seem right to stab 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.320
 however still on this game and so not 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 we can do nothing about it 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.410
 practically then another thing 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.400
 practically always on this map 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.799
 the other day I died at 24 in a row 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.750
 because a dog made like a jump 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.530
 from the bottom I was practically in this 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.290
 home you are having right now 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.630
 I don't know the dog without going up the stairs 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.569
 probably will have been a bug did 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.990
 a jump and climbed over the house and me 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.490
 he killed so instantly that I don't know 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.459
 what to say because we say that in this 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.410
 game the dog is really too strong 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.920
 however it takes 5 killing of row 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:20.160
 with inflexible 4 so think about it 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:21.690
 and it's a killstreak I don't know is useful 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 for those who have nothing to do 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.240
 because in the end it does to you how many it does 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.669
 but some killing doesn't make sense 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.880
 get killed by tomorrow from 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.570
 those useless dog that is useless 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.190
 in any case, a very last thing 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.550
 I had to tell you that precisely in these 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.990
 days I wanted to try some gameplay 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.729
 however to make these gameplay me 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.240
 would need a small hand from you 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.800
 so anyway if you want help 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.490
 who sent me a private message 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.150
 on the xbox my gt rrrb usher 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.830
 unplugged the puzzle and write to me invites 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.130
 myths help as you want and precisely 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.479
 let's play together and if you want help me 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.190
 however said this the video is going to 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.580
 finish I invite you as usual to 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.500
 leave a like to comment if you 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.690
 liked it and nothing 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.940
 I hope this video is there 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.000
 both liked are repetitive yes though not 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.000
 so many things to say so excuse me 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.010
 but nothing to be born here all passed 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.010
 also on the beautiful facebook page
