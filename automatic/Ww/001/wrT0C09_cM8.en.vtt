00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.599
 guys all hello sat down at thirty 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 the sixth floor of the building in which 101 floor 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.400
 Chezom online put aside this joke 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 gigabyte company secret room 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.950
 it is a pity that it is not as secret as 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.450
 we would like because 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.740
 product which I will tell later 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.020
 not here but we want 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.019
 literally ten seconds to devote here this 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.500
 the stuff is called brix brix 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.030
 This is a mini computer, that is , this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.260
 system unit clause we told 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.809
 about painting and nipples so in his pisi 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.789
 the size of exactly 4 brixes but maybe 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.620
 three and a half is a full-fledged comp 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.409
 Moreover such a computer is this one 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.909
 on andy on md and this one 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.059
 but in fact he is almost the same 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.309
 size and then on the processor core i7 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.879
 there is a full processor stuck in here 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 core i7 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.430
 true two fourth generation all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.440
 well 2 ports usb 30 on the front side 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.680
 although there is no difference what to leave 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.940
 to arctic audio jack in the back from us 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.300
 2 more ports yusb 30 fully network 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.900
 mini displayport and hdmi connector full 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.510
 set is all cooling unfortunately 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.220
 there are no guys out but no ride 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.710
 gigabytes of us from the scientific unit 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
 so a full consultation he was 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.610
 almost we can not know what is here 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.560
 passive or active cooling 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.710
 for sure active in such and such 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.630
 box 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.940
 here is another device it is interesting to those 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.790
 what is it here don't pay attention to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.900
 all this creativity here can be 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.159
 wireless charging module that is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.110
 just have such a box cap 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.930
 put on top of the phone maybe 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.640
 some kind of rubberized coating and your 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.500
 the phone itself is charging itself 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 supports this feature abs 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.649
 carefully here are these things 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.780
 and that's what grow on wanted to say about 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.600
 very interesting to the company gigabyte 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.150
 there is the same brix box 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.769
 computer with built-in projector mod 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.630
 some went to build the projector where 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.330
 nor is the tablet building smartphones 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.040
 smartphones have built mean briks 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.860
 in fact, you get this 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.660
 computer yes here it is the monitor all here is all 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.930
 the system then the mouse and keyboard connect 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.580
 here and work bet and it broadcasts 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.340
 on the projector wall please don't question i 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.700
 I am sure that all this is done not red 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.350
 just for the sake of and not for the sake of some beauty 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.030
 projector computers system connected 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.250
 each other that is if you have there 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.850
 some movies are in the system unit 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.620
 you do not connect the projector to the laptop 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.989
 or put the computer somewhere separately 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.730
 and turn on the broadcast and just the whole 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.370
 computer brings to the presentation stupidly 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.799
 the computer is inside there is an ssd drive 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.230
 put and all you have and 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.420
 icons brought projectors brought them 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.970
 all this weighs nothing grams 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.180
 there is much here that 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.120
 70200 maybe please drive 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.890
 It works like this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.380
 still built-in wifi module inside 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.380
 there is a box made of aluminum
