00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
Charlie one at Bravo and to add a alpha

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.150 
Charlie one at Bravo and to add a alpha
and<00:00:59.420> after<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.539> unlock<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.109> three<00:01:01.620> stations

not the M conversations about the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.410 
not the M conversations about the
stations<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> objectives<00:01:06.439> a<00:01:07.939> new<00:01:08.939> part

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
stations for the objectives a new part

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
stations for the objectives a new part
of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> map<00:01:09.750> opens<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> opens<00:01:10.920> up

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of the map opens up and it opens up

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
of the map opens up and it opens up
right<00:01:11.250> beside<00:01:11.400> alpha<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.540> makes

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
right beside alpha so it just makes

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.770 
right beside alpha so it just makes
sense<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> alpha<00:01:13.979> last<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sense to go to alpha last and this is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
sense to go to alpha last and this is
the<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.170> level<00:01:19.729> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.119> little

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the one level of the first little

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.620 
the one level of the first little
there's<00:01:21.540> more<00:01:21.780> than<00:01:21.930> two<00:01:21.960> mcom<00:01:22.500> stations

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
there's more than two mcom stations

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.280 
there's more than two mcom stations
we're<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.110> an<00:01:25.200> achievement

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
we're also going to get an achievement
