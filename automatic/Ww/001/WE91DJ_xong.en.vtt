00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.990
 the entrance into a new god that has not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 installed never enters if you enter your 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.689
 and it will have a hatching time of a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.689
 minute so I'm going to advance this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 Well, as you could see here, 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.699
 in place and we place it this is the new 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.220
 island came here not lay it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.420
 I'm just remodeling him as you can 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.269
 see is cleaning the stones but 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 well I'll put it on this side and then 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:06.400
 I will go up my island already well accommodated and everything 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.900
 we give it here 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.820
 we zoom in and put the dragon to 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.700
 make it look faster or the dragon if you 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.340
 approach a cloud and squeeze the dragon 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.000
 as I am doing and here I leave 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 with a song 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.570
 Well, good friends how you could see and 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.710
 that was all on the part of a dragon 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.470
 elements 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.310
 that at the moment as I told you a while ago 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.850
 I have it here, in fact I'm going to accommodate 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.320
 my habitats are good for women 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.700
 because as you could see in that new 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.160
 update of the 22 will see all the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.970
 new two islands as it is reached 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.710
 appreciate well if they reach good already 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.580
 can better appreciate their habitats and 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.040
 everything and they have more good spaces here 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.590
 can do a good as they could see 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.600
 is to give an element that equals 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.190
 four elements that I think are the 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.950
 main the most the most 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.840
 main that would be the ice 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.370
 electric earth and fire 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.480

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.430

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.190

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.080
