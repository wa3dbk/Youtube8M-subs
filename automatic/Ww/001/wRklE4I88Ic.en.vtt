00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 subject live channel here new sms mail 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.450
 Parcel arrived which in principle did not 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 waited as if the people who repair 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.969
 what it sends or mine and they always 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.150
 call warn that send almost 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 always or something that I order somewhere 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 there are suppliers 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 I also know, and then something came as if I were 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 not quite aware of what it is let's 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:36.320
 let's see why I decided 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:38.190
 video shoot this is our webcam 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 well, at least 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:52.710
 webcam boxes let's take a look 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:53.489
 let's see what we have here or or 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.289
 etc. 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.300
 this is what i think all the same yes or no 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.659
 or yes or no I don't know exactly how to me 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.090
 I would call one of my subscriber about 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 about the clock here are the ones that I 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 I built on an indicator of this I will show you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.619
 which I have already shown you in some 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.619
 roller skates 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.390
 here is actually this watch so here 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.229
 I came out did not shoot 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 making this watch because it's 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.000
 planned as a mock trial 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.979
 version of the principle the way it turned out 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.820
 if I will make the second version more 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.689
 better 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.539
 on compact dreamed it will be necessary 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.640
 video and from making boards to pay 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:02:01.619
 whether as Samson Samson 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:08.420
 the rate what did it come it such 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.630
 indicators came yes only this is not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 luminescence 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:22.709
 and gas discharge here such here it is 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.390
 I think z50 730 m yes I remembered everything no 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.400
 subscribers wrote that he he 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.739
 send indicators true to me 2 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.160
 subscriber wrote 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:41.220
 so here from one of them they 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.060
 here come here are four little ones 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.790
 smaller ones are basically quite similar 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.319
 on the Soviet im8 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.709
 Here at least the size of such here 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:00.230
 small compact what are we just 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.230
 should come pay 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.000
 a set for making watches here 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.650
 on such indicators and we have like me 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.640
 showed you a little bit 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.549
 we bought here in 12 such here and now 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.580
 we have these 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.280
 try try can do on 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.340
 such still with these slightly easier 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.280
 these can be directly soldered to the board 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.459
 but these need panels and mount in 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.709
 the body and this format is not quite 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.110
 convenient and uncomfortable let's say if this 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.959
 such a crush something a box and once 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:47.260
 not on this box like this 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.069
 here although I still certainly a supporter 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.170
 more 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.260
 luminescent indicator i like 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.790
 Now this ominous green light but 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.190
 gas discharge well I love them too 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.709
 like but more than an athlete not scenes there I 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.260
 here once looking at ukr picked up there 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.600
 and the smartest I saw once 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.940
 served and the Japanese indicator of 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.310
 generally with their futuristic japanese 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.700
 gorgeous font oh god i want to 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.160
 they have already bought there you have it properly
