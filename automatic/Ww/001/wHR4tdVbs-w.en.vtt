formed<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.420> 1960s<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:59.160> imagine<00:02:59.250> current

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
formed the 1960s I can imagine current

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.180 
formed the 1960s I can imagine current
writers<00:03:00.390> having<00:03:00.810> them<00:03:01.020> being<00:03:01.290> assembled<00:03:01.710> yes

but<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.820> year<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.660> original<00:03:03.780> one<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
but the year is not the original one it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.220 
but the year is not the original one it
might<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.640> more<00:03:05.820> reason<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.540> fit<00:03:06.750> into<00:03:06.930> more

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
might be more reason to fit into more

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.950 
might be more reason to fit into more
realistic<00:03:07.920> years<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.610> not<00:03:09.090> even<00:03:09.270> mention<00:03:09.840> at

realistic years or not even mention at

realistic years or not even mention at
all<00:03:10.370> according<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.670> example<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.870> last

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
all according to this example the last

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.530 
all according to this example the last
clearly<00:03:13.710> marked<00:03:14.130> event<00:03:14.580> was<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> death<00:03:15.300> of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
clearly marked event was the death of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.680 
clearly marked event was the death of
Jean<00:03:15.810> Grey<00:03:16.280> Phoenix<00:03:17.280> which<00:03:17.880> was<00:03:18.060> an<00:03:18.180> uncanny

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
Jean Grey Phoenix which was an uncanny

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.440 
Jean Grey Phoenix which was an uncanny
x-men<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.910> very<00:03:21.300> good

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
x-men I think that this is a very good

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.100 
x-men I think that this is a very good
example<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.400> remember<00:03:24.239> reading

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
example because if I remember reading

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.699 
example because if I remember reading
comics<00:03:25.680> past<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.160> point<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.239> years<00:03:27.780> which

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
comics past that point the years which

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.620 
comics past that point the years which
will<00:03:28.920> reference<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.489> stories<00:03:30.000> did<00:03:30.239> become<00:03:30.600> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
will reference and stories did become a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.520 
will reference and stories did become a
little<00:03:31.050> bit<00:03:31.230> hazy<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.270> this

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
little bit hazy so think about this

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.320 
little bit hazy so think about this
there's<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.920> criticism<00:03:35.670> with<00:03:35.820> Marvel

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
there's a lot of criticism with Marvel

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.160 
there's a lot of criticism with Marvel
now<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.500> more<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.459> than<00:03:38.640> DC<00:03:39.180> let's<00:03:39.930> give<00:03:40.140> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
now I think more so than DC let's give a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.860 
now I think more so than DC let's give a
good<00:03:40.380> example<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.730> marriage<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.300> Mary<00:03:42.570> Jane

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
good example the marriage of Mary Jane

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.170 
good example the marriage of Mary Jane
Watson<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.530> Peter<00:03:43.739> Parker<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.550> don't<00:03:45.090> even

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
Watson and Peter Parker I don't even

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.510 
Watson and Peter Parker I don't even
have<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.660> mention<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.200> if<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.860> heard<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.280> what

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
have to mention it if you heard of what

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.260 
have to mention it if you heard of what
happened<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.750> would<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.020> explaining<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:49.890> me

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
happened you would be explaining not me

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.790 
happened you would be explaining not me
we<00:03:51.270> all<00:03:51.450> know<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.110> relationship<00:03:52.680> between

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
relationship that existed in the comics

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.000 
relationship that existed in the comics
for<00:03:59.220> all<00:03:59.459> those<00:03:59.760> years<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.690> then<00:04:01.380> all<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.800> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
for all those years and then all of a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.380 
for all those years and then all of a
sudden<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.000> break-up<00:04:03.860> which<00:04:04.860> was<00:04:05.190> not<00:04:05.640> really

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
sudden the break-up which was not really

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.860 
sudden the break-up which was not really
good<00:04:06.750> either<00:04:07.520> not<00:04:08.520> only<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.720> i<00:04:09.750> believe

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
good either not only at but i believe

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.570 
good either not only at but i believe

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
comics anymore but that's another
