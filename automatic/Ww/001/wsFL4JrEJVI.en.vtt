 We were told to show that we do not have 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.500
 rights to show this movie due to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170

 or even five minutes after the start of the show 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 was 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.240
 in the house of the cinema shut off the light sudden 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 the blackout of the hall administration 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.770
 explained short circuit and fire 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.070
 what happened next building 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.810
 from where the mains cable 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.670
 primitive excuse of officials of course 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 nobody believed it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.240
 it happens and we decided to check was and fire 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 or short at worst 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:42.900
 I thought you had it very much 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:47.360
 look what is about to read it I 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.360
 Honestly, I donâ€™t see colors of fire 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.090

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.180
 Kyrgyzstan to ordinary documentary 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 Film opposition calls for cowardice 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.290

 Pro-Russian President Atambayev 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.900
 the very beginning of the series its political 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.270
 line from the position of the Kremlin is a continuation 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.930
 that policy when our government runs 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.820
 all the time Moscow they are even afraid 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.700
 show some 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.150
 Theme films about Ukraine which 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.030
 contrary to the interests of the Kremlin and communication with 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.640
 by this they decided to just turn it on and off 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.910
 electricity because not officially 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.800
 giving permission was a shame to them 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.990
 time for most Kyrgyz people then 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.990

 like most countries in the region 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.510
 is strongly influenced 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.070
 Russian media federal channels 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.530

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.010
 preconceived information well people now 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.650

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.090
 Ukraine and more so let's say 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.370
 write zaki 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.860
 to Europe and how would this be very 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.720
 difficult for them, meanwhile, leadership 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.370
 Bishkek Duma on continues 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.380

 insists on technical reason 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.450
 interrupted show but how then 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.820
