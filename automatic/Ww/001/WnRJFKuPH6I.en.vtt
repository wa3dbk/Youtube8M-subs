00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.560
 is a picture book is one more you have a cooked not to count we do not count 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.219
 no history 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.329
 we give a little bit of the curriculum and attended last year 2009 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.469
 I have made a puppet joy for four events per week 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 before it is impossible to tell the story because it is a story 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.149
 no better boring but very long very long very long very long and it almost 30 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.000
 years 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 working 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.769
 if then we do not not which only him 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.360
 little of an image 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.080
 at different levels, I'm very happy d 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.510
 being part of the designers association Spanish is because it is 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.700
 an association that was very small recently 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.640
 but what is making each day bigger 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 and it's a very very very very very attractive association 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.720
 then in Spain 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.470
 I think that as we have had many problems the designers are very 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.530
 together we are making a 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.789
 and as the union makes the strength and takes very important 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.789
 after the association has many many things each 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 almost every week and something one thing two things 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 I think that's being very important, I've been a little bit 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.160
 pioneers in convincing the association that we had to be more 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.890
 international 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.430
 and well little by little we are getting it and this book as well a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160
 important moment 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.210
 because we are all together and corresponds to Spanish fashion I do not know 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.080
 can not be compared with French fashion or Italian fashion because 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.220
 French fashion takes centuries of advantage Italian fashion has an industry 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.380
 super powerful 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.020
 after the galfisa italian equitalia americana fashion is one of the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.720
 fashions that have more representation 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.880
 but I think that I can see that I am Spanish for many things 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.770
 example min favorite artist in history is Picasso 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.980
 that Picasso was Spanish and I think there are many 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.050
 many things of Spanish art as the joy for me is very important the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 sun color many things 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 no no no 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.069
 conaf a little way 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.389
 strange as it came to the world of fashion 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.059
 for that reason through 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.629
 of the painting was 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.239
 they make two positions 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.099
 of painting in art gallery in madrid 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.299
 and decided to use it 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.309
 second-hand military clothing as a support 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.689
 for painting 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.719
 percent 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.659

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.669

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.109

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.760
 I think that right now he also left a good time for Spanish fashion with

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:04.769

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.549
 most important and influential in the world of d 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.799
