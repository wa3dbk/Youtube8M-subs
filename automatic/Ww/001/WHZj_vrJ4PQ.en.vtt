want to go inside the structure and on

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.980 
want to go inside the structure and on
the<00:00:49.430> ground<00:00:49.670> you'll<00:00:49.850> find<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.270> dead<00:00:50.510> adventurer

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
the ground you'll find a dead adventurer

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.190 
the ground you'll find a dead adventurer
search<00:00:51.620> his<00:00:51.800> body<00:00:52.040> no<00:00:52.490> homo<00:00:52.850> for<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.420> torn<00:00:53.990> note

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
search his body no homo for a torn note

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.070 
search his body no homo for a torn note
and<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:55.100> will<00:00:55.280> say<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.970> he<00:00:56.570> was<00:00:56.690> trapped<00:00:56.930> in

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
and it will say that he was trapped in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080 
and it will say that he was trapped in
the<00:00:57.170> room<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.620> he<00:00:58.310> felt<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.580> breeze<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.000> air

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
the room and he felt a breeze in the air

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.540 
the room and he felt a breeze in the air
so<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.320> could<00:01:00.650> assume<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.130> there's<00:01:01.430> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
so that could assume that there's a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.450 
so that could assume that there's a
secret<00:01:01.880> passageway<00:01:02.240> in<00:01:02.600> there<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.740> I<00:01:04.100> looked
