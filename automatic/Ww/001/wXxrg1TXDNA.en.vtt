00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.120
 a sustainable system is a mode of development that has the capacity 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.250
 to be self-financing and in the future 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.130
 green development this state of sustainability is a way of 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 sustainable development a human perspective a way of development 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 sustainable for our planet means that it can continue to perform the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.880
 same process that she is currently performing to create the feast of 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.400
 drinking water food production she knows that we allow a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.380
 quality of life 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.720
 indefinitely 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 an unsustainable development mode means the opposite of these and if 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 the moment a tracker and shells we are currently on sale 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.730
 he already did a Swedish scientific workshop have developed a definition 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.840
 of sustainable development with four basic principles these presses 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.820
 can be seen as the guidelines for taking care of the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 planet by applying them this is beneficial to the planet what we 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.780
 did everything we do ourselves part of this system 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.980
 planetary 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.270
 the assets are as follows 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.870
 3 and play the same it puts our dependence on fossil fuels and if 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.610
 con but the whole group I will see even eliminate our dependence on products 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.740
 synthetic chemicals 3 I saw and I even eliminate our destruction 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.920
 of nature 4 that would still be I'm not the ability of individuals 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.150
 ap to support themselves 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.720
 growing population and changing our way of life creating 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.870
 an ever greater demand for the services provided by the land 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.250
 soyaux war food 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.130
 on the other hand the capacity of the land to protoss effervescence in decline is due 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.580
 to our way of life 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.960
 by our growth we're destroying the system that does not get 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 door 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850
 we have become a danger to our way of life 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 aca is a system where everything is connected society environment economy 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 to adopt a mode of sustainable development just follow the four 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.190
 facets and apply them in each of our daily activities 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.759
 at work how home if we apply all the precepts we 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.200
 can work together for a mode of development of this drama and ensure 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.870
 to everyone a better quality of life 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.000
 the less pollutant 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.850
 we aspire - we will create more value for our society while 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.910
 improving the capacity of our planet four days the elements 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.090
 essential to our source
