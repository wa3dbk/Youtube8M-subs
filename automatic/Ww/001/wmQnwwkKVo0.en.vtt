00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.830
 ah 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.900
 Greetings and welcome are all of you 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.060
 in the comments I'm Luis Garcia in the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.100
 narrative christian martinoli as you 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.140
 hey cristian a privilege to be here the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.210
 today with this fantastic atmosphere 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 there will be many emotions in the game 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 at least I hope so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 let's see then the two teams 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 There is something that you would like to comment on 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.810
 this meeting mister garcÃ­a in effect 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.640
 both teams have dedicated enough 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 time to physical preparation and to 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.840
 technical preparation so only 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.409
 they will need a little bit of luck to 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.409
 to be able to win 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.310
 and we start 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 what a beautiful spectacle of poses 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.959
 what good chance does he not have 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
 managed to get into this defense so 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.769
 organized they have to stop the attack 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 in that sector look for another possibility 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.870
 support yourself to see if pity 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.250
 Wants to enter 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.160
 get a very good ball shoot with 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 all 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.460
 1 to 0 the scoreboard 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 It is so tight but it seems that it arrived 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.560
 just to take advantage if you swindle your 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.240
 marker at the right time but what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.240
 happens if simply excellent
