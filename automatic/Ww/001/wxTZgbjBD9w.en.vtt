up<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.560> hill

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.850 

now<00:03:12.510> those<00:03:12.810> also<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.379> new<00:03:13.620> tires<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.340> it

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
now those also have new tires on it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.649 
now those also have new tires on it
mostly<00:03:16.860> for<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.189> dirt<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.030> they<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.299> work<00:03:18.510> in

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
mostly for the dirt but they do work in

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.179 
mostly for the dirt but they do work in
the<00:03:18.689> mud<00:03:18.959> pretty<00:03:19.260> well<00:03:19.439> with<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> little<00:03:19.890> bit<00:03:20.099> of

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
the mud pretty well with a little bit of

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.619 
the mud pretty well with a little bit of
wheelspin<00:03:20.370> we'll<00:03:20.819> go<00:03:20.939> through<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> mud<00:03:21.420> one

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:30.330 
wheelspin we'll go through the mud one
time<00:03:21.870> some<00:03:22.170> already<00:03:22.560> dirty

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.300 

that's<00:03:31.340> it

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.589 
pre-loading
you<00:03:41.819> can<00:03:41.939> make<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.209> through<00:03:42.359> pretty<00:03:42.510> much

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
you can make it through pretty much

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.770 
you can make it through pretty much
anything<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.319> seats<00:03:43.560> actually<00:03:44.040> real<00:03:44.219> nice

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
anything but seats actually real nice

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.399 
anything but seats actually real nice
I'm<00:03:45.780> more<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.290> stand-up<00:03:46.739> rider<00:03:47.010> these<00:03:47.310> days

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
I'm more of a stand-up rider these days

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.849 
I'm more of a stand-up rider these days
but<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.620> think<00:03:49.829> now<00:03:49.980> mine<00:03:51.439> flopping<00:03:52.439> down<00:03:52.469> on

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
but I think now mine flopping down on

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.500 
but I think now mine flopping down on
this<00:03:53.010> seat<00:03:53.840> very<00:03:54.840> pleased<00:03:55.170> me<00:03:56.180> gonna<00:03:57.180> take<00:03:57.390> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
this seat very pleased me gonna take the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.110 
this seat very pleased me gonna take the
non<00:03:57.719> muddy<00:03:58.049> route<00:03:58.290> back

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.300 

I<00:04:04.290> think<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.409> bike<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.860> little<00:04:06.069> bit

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
I think this bike is a little bit

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.979 
I think this bike is a little bit
heavier<00:04:06.700> than<00:04:06.730> some<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.239> newer<00:04:07.450> trail<00:04:07.810> or

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
heavier than some of the newer trail or

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.339 
heavier than some of the newer trail or
motocross<00:04:08.470> bikes<00:04:08.799> but<00:04:09.930> overall<00:04:10.930> the

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
motocross bikes but overall the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.490 
motocross bikes but overall the
ergonomics<00:04:11.980> are<00:04:12.099> very<00:04:12.340> well-thought-out

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
ergonomics are very well-thought-out

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.430 
ergonomics are very well-thought-out
very<00:04:14.500> well<00:04:14.709> balanced<00:04:15.250> handles<00:04:15.580> great<00:04:16.440> very

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
very well balanced handles great very

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:28.510 
very well balanced handles great very
predictable

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.110 

that's<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.270> halfway<00:04:30.720> through<00:04:31.229> 30<00:04:31.470> years

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
that's this is halfway through 30 years

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.650 
that's this is halfway through 30 years
hardly<00:04:33.120> even<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.569> it<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:33.900> now

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.170

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
handles that pretty well little ruts use

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.590 
handles that pretty well little ruts use
