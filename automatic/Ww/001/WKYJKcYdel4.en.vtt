00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 When I look, my God, to the world, 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.000
 which you created with your mighty word 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 and all these nations, 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 that you care for with your Spirit. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:29.800
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are. 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.200
 And when life gives me a heavy burden 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.600
 and my soul is weary to death, 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Your father's hand will take away the burden of me 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 and will help me to bear what seems unbearable. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:22.400
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are. 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:35.000
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 When you call me off my Lord, 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 then your glory will dazzle me with your eternal brightness, 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 and then shall my clean garment be given me. 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 Then I will see you, Jesus, the King of love. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 My heart blesses you and sings, how great you are, how great you are.
