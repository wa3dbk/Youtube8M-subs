00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.380
 the kitchen block 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.540

 the living room 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.130
 the year 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 he took all the sofas 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.140
 i also had scale as a terrace as the weather has risen too it is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 was possible to be ahead of the screens 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.519
 You know that does not exercise on the internet 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.060
 hans clock 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.419
 but just 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.829
 banks 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.959
 is this now the mobile vacation or a while of the future 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.839
 why 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.799
 plan ready today 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.089
 but I knew that the college writes in a statement from the accused 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.679
 the flight forward all with all those people there and the winners of it 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.679
 design price rotterdam 19 46 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.239
 greengrocer 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.709
 make some of it for the church 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.709
 that increases the advice 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.310
 I have been told that nobody will be included there is the idea 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.389
 this because they put 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.609
 the French city has that obvious 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.189
 that appears from the responses 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.929
 I assume we don't 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.929
 have also seen it positively but I show him this 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.889
 edwards 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 that was the assignment 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.479
 it is also going to make 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.179
 designed only 17 years ago 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:24.659
 internet is 86 the run was a temporary living competition in almere 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.889
 and then I had translated a temporary home as a mobile home 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.199
 and I presented the reality and other files of that 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.849
 special statements well 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.009
 that is part of it 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.689
 but the moment is silent that you have to make me don't have it 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.849
 a lot of money is waiting to be realized 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.769
 so it took quite some time to support 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.180
 anyway finds that is a dead horse that was a year ago yes 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.019
 and how to choose freely 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.980
 how much money they do that much worse me he goes 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.909
 conductor at the station 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.199
 The contract is to sit in three engines 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.429
 as a motor-movable floor, perform the second motor and make it easy 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.419
 the turn sometimes confused about 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.449
 The 26 seconds happened is state like a kind of captain Marco Crown two 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.889
 buttons and or bots 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.139
 and is trading the share for the design of the boiler bridge tower in camps 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.810
 in the second team 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.069
 I stand you just got you this round 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.069
 without a toilet heavily injured that is actually media 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.289
 it does not do your motorcycle in midfield it is good 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.050
 housing 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.830
 I actually have the most Harstads permanent camping when I have 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 So there was a corner of land when I was excited to get it 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.669
 quite a lot is rss 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.900
 as a route the gnomes so that it is the interest that is interesting 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.789
 that is the most interesting, not so exciting 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.520
 it the house rightly a house in the moment is cut down 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.800
 The screen can change as the weather changes and as you campers 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.999
 always work with rain again 9 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:04.809
 if it rains to keep the barber mails trying to clean you remove 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.019
 can actually use a branch of the living room sitting on a terrace outside 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:10.439
 only the awning 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.099
 it does contain a campsite 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.520
 it all turned out well 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.700
 a boy alone 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.270
 I know nothing about the pixon though, otherwise yes only well 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.199
 I have a cup of tea in Almere to go on holiday and have the opportunity myself 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.839
 I have never thought of this meter 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.069
 belga one goes better 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.199
 Sweden has repressed the Netherlands when I go to the doctor 9 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.719
 9 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.629
 it might go to the art conversation but yes if i pass by 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.330
 we go now 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.699
 of course anyway i can't always be tense as almere's trainer 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.279
 the whole family 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.300
 I would say as should come then it is difficult said the president of 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:53.109
 Egypt without exception will be made one by one 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.080
 7 percent fall on a village in south London 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.500
 to go for this you are and you can turn or this is really not camping though 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.710
 but then in the tents that's why I also have one 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.980
 the van designed the absolute truth 3 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.980
 would you know he with this core and child welfare 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.369
 so no 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.759
 thanks to paper textiles 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.229
 it is still saving a little 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.340
 tessa wideemeren what is what is the earlier the audience prize as the 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.580
 jury prize 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.580
 if it can freeze say that is the nicest 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.259
 the jury praises it is the first 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.319
 but it is so 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.639
 value points to the public anyway what is already going into the art hall so I already think so 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.960
 many 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.259
 and if the selected recently with a big lead the center plans 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.460
 Marianne Timmer nevertheless once sold a product a good product 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.969
 so I have a lot higher 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:51.980
 personally it was very simple 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.440
 six other wounded bonnard australian things are happening 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.539
 and once finally 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.639
 the 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.369
 what it is actually 

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.369
 the magic of design box 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.379
 if you have the guts to think what you are doing 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.499
 despite all the influences of everything, just trying his work 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:19.919
 learn to listen to ing 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.069
 very important 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.129
 one thing to include in you others say but also through your own fashion salon 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.270
 just continue to add something to what was already there 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.410
 therefore try to look from within yourself 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.570
 and i think i also last then talk i think i am not so good with 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.289
 to become 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:41.210
 but the anchor finds the cidi beckham concrete and then kennedy cataract 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.379
 is there 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.709
 and you can calm down just so she still likes it very much 

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.629
 the concert skin I dare say quite dark suit is created exactly 

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:55.849
 brought with it seems to me also beautiful job 

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:56.960
 brought the year
