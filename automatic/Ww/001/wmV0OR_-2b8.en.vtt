we need Triceratops skeleton it is so
small<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:51.420> say<00:01:51.600> normally<00:01:52.110> that's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
small and I would say normally that's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
small and I would say normally that's
probably<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.890> project<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.730> could<00:01:53.910> have

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
probably a project that we could have

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
probably a project that we could have
started<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.740> away<00:01:55.980> for<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> little

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
started and then put away for a little

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.950 
started and then put away for a little
bit<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> worked<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.690> bit<00:01:57.840> each

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
bit and worked on it a little bit each

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.450 
bit and worked on it a little bit each
day<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.500> since<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.800> were<00:01:58.920> doing<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.190> video<00:01:59.400> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
day but since we were doing the video I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.220 
day but since we were doing the video I
thought<00:01:59.670> I'd<00:01:59.730> just<00:02:00.120> go<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.900> do<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.020> all

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
thought I'd just go for it and do it all

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.900 
thought I'd just go for it and do it all
at<00:02:01.350> once<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.800> couldn't<00:02:02.460> find<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> hammer

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
at once and couldn't find a hammer

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.840 
at once and couldn't find a hammer
that's<00:02:03.180> why<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> used<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.020> wrench<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.580> guess

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that's why I used to wrench so I guess

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.460 
that's why I used to wrench so I guess
it's<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.300> cool<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.900> have<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.320> more

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
it's pretty cool now we have one more

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.040 
it's pretty cool now we have one more
little<00:02:07.680> dinosaur<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.790> little<00:02:09.119> dinosaur
