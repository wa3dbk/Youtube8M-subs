00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
I think they pretty much nailed it now

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
I think they pretty much nailed it now
these<00:01:09.750> guys<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.740> bought<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
these guys they actually bought the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
domain xpcom reportedly for a hundred
thousand<00:01:15.780> dollars<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> be

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
