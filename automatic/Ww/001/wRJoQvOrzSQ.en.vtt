this buckle when I bought it it looked
like<00:04:58.130> this<00:04:58.960> I'm<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.110> little<00:05:00.139> bit<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.680> treatment

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
like this I'm a little bit of treatment

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.589 
like this I'm a little bit of treatment
it<00:05:01.789> looks<00:05:02.449> like<00:05:02.509> this<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.289> unfortunately

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
it looks like this and unfortunately

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.999 
it looks like this and unfortunately
because<00:05:05.599> of<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.870> value<00:05:06.289> of<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.590> lot<00:05:06.770> of<00:05:06.919> these

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
artifacts you really have to be careful

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.540 
artifacts you really have to be careful
when<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.669> go<00:05:10.700> out<00:05:11.029> and<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.360> buy<00:05:11.510> artifact

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
when you go out and you buy artifact

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.790 
when you go out and you buy artifact

the ultimate fine for me would probably

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.230 
the ultimate fine for me would probably
be<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.110> virginia<00:05:22.949> state<00:05:23.220> seal<00:05:23.550> sword<00:05:24.030> belt

value is something different and I

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.680 
value is something different and I
really<00:05:55.800> irate<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:56.520> much<00:05:56.909> higher<00:05:57.180> than<00:05:57.210> the

really irate that much higher than the
you<00:05:57.870> know<00:05:57.990> monetary<00:05:58.530> value<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:59.539> actually

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
you know monetary value I actually

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.600 
you know monetary value I actually

out of this several years ago I realized

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.219 
out of this several years ago I realized
that<00:06:05.759> this<00:06:06.090> is<00:06:06.270> so<00:06:06.449> much<00:06:06.629> in<00:06:06.780> my<00:06:06.930> blood<00:06:07.199> now

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229
