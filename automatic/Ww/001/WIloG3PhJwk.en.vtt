get<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.799> messy<00:01:41.220> depending<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> lure

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
get kind of messy depending on the lure

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.910 
get kind of messy depending on the lure
that<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:42.869> throwing<00:01:43.229> heavy<00:01:43.409> lures<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that you're throwing heavy lures and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
that you're throwing heavy lures and
stuff<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> makes<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> makes<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stuff like that it makes it makes it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
stuff like that it makes it makes it
difficult<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:46.890> thing<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.130> need<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
difficult so the other thing you need to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.389 
difficult so the other thing you need to
think<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.970> visibility<00:01:49.220> when<00:01:50.220> you're

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think about is visibility when you're

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.850 
think about is visibility when you're
fishing<00:01:51.000> Dacron<00:01:51.390> line<00:01:51.630> Dacron<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fishing Dacron line Dacron is going to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.580 
fishing Dacron line Dacron is going to
have<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> higher<00:01:53.220> visibility<00:01:53.399> than<00:01:53.909> mock<00:01:54.060> then

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
have a higher visibility than mock then

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
have a higher visibility than mock then
your<00:01:55.590> monofilament<00:01:56.329> fluorocarbon<00:01:57.329> lines<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
your monofilament fluorocarbon lines is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.450 
your monofilament fluorocarbon lines is
version<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> monofilament<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.890> very<00:01:59.219> little

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
version of monofilament has very little

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.020 
version of monofilament has very little
light<00:01:59.700> refraction<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.719> clear<00:02:01.079> so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
light refraction so it's pretty clear so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.069 
light refraction so it's pretty clear so
when<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.180> fishing<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.689> need<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> think

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
when you're fishing you need to think

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.289 
when you're fishing you need to think
about<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.469> delivery<00:02:04.649> how<00:02:05.340> far<00:02:05.670> away<00:02:06.000> or

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
about your delivery how far away or

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
about your delivery how far away or
close<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> fish<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> bait<00:02:08.369> to

the boat is stretched going to be it to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.150 
the boat is stretched going to be it to
your<00:02:10.739> advantage

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
your advantage

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
your advantage
or<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.700> no<00:02:12.060> stretch<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> your
