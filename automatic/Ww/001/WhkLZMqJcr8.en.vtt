00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
these guys in collateral if you guys

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.580 
these guys in collateral if you guys
didn't<00:00:50.489> know<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> shoot<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> zombie

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.299 
didn't know if you shoot a zombie
everybody<00:00:52.590> should<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
everybody should know this but if you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.470 
everybody should know this but if you
shoot<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.640> zombie<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> zombie

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

behind<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.110> hits<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> zombie<00:00:56.010> behind

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
behind them it hits the zombie behind

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.689 
behind them it hits the zombie behind
them<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.180> gives<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> collateral<00:00:57.840> damage

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
them and it gives you collateral damage

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.889 
them and it gives you collateral damage
so<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> points<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.660> go

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so you can see the points right there go

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
so you can see the points right there go
goes<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.649> crazy<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
goes a little bit crazy when that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
goes a little bit crazy when that
happens<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.030> definitely<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> go

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
happens so definitely a good way to go

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.469 
happens so definitely a good way to go
also<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> again<00:01:06.450> a

need<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> points<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> end

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
need to make a lot of points what I end

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
need to make a lot of points what I end
up<00:01:23.100> doing<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.640> end<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.330> towards

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
up doing is I just end up going towards

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
up doing is I just end up going towards
generator<00:01:24.960> 3<00:01:25.350> instead<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> generator<00:01:26.189> 2

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
generator 3 instead of generator 2

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.140 
generator 3 instead of generator 2
because<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:28.369> make<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.490> 7<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> out

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because there is a make a 7 for you out

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.260 
because there is a make a 7 for you out
by<00:01:30.299> generator<00:01:30.659> 3<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.409> decide<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
by generator 3 so I decide to not go the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
by generator 3 so I decide to not go the
generator<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.840> route<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.380> generator<00:01:34.740> 3

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
generator to route I want generator 3

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
generator to route I want generator 3
and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.229> area

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and then I'm going to go over this area

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340 
and then I'm going to go over this area
and<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:39.180> try<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> no-man's<00:01:40.229> land

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and and try to get the no-man's land

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
and and try to get the no-man's land
thing<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.610> begin<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> Remington

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
thing and I end up begin a Remington

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.520 
thing and I end up begin a Remington
there<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> Remington

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there but we don't want the Remington

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.469 
there but we don't want the Remington
because<00:01:43.890> Remington<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
because Remington is not really going to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
because Remington is not really going to
be<00:01:45.540> able<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.810> much<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.200> us<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.979> pretty

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
be able to do much for us so it's pretty

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710 
be able to do much for us so it's pretty
important<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> use<00:01:48.210> every<00:01:48.509> bullet

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
important that you use every bullet

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
important that you use every bullet
possible<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.560> gun<00:01:49.740> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
possible from your gun if you can get a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.660 
possible from your gun if you can get a
Mauser<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> dig<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.590> even<00:01:53.250> better<00:01:53.399> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
Mauser from the dig up even better if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.649 
Mauser from the dig up even better if
you<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
you get a

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.780 
you get a
máximo<00:01:56.659> even<00:01:56.930> better<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.680> every<00:01:58.159> again

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
máximo even better because every again

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.120 
máximo even better because every again
every<00:01:59.060> little<00:01:59.300> point<00:01:59.450> is<00:02:00.110> going<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.350> count<00:02:00.860> so

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
every little point is going to count so

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.790 
every little point is going to count so
you<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.580> see<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.729> have<00:02:01.909> 2600<00:02:02.479> points<00:02:02.900> now<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
you can see I have 2600 points now it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.960 
you can see I have 2600 points now it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
to open two doors one of them is 1250

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.060 
to open two doors one of them is 1250
one<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.250> them<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.520> thousand<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.950> to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
one of them is a thousand so I have to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.470 
one of them is a thousand so I have to

difficult<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.130> end<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:22.400> even<00:02:22.610> buying<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.360> gun

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020

difficult and I end up even buying a gun
right<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.440> because<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.220> figured<00:02:25.520> I'd<00:02:25.640> get<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
right here because I figured I'd get the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.580 
right here because I figured I'd get the
most<00:02:26.030> points<00:02:26.270> from<00:02:26.900> shooting<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.230> gun<00:02:27.410> now

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
most points from shooting this gun now

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.160 
most points from shooting this gun now
if<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.800> shoot<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:29.000> low<00:02:29.209> rounds<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.630> there

if you shoot really low rounds in there
I<00:02:30.230> went<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.620> many<00:02:30.830> shots<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.209> hit<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
I went to many shots but if you hit a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.130 
I went to many shots but if you hit a

him not that way you can get points from
shooting<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.180> gun<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.600> get<00:02:41.750> more<00:02:41.870> points

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
shooting the gun but you get more points

for knifing ended up getting a max ammo
unfortunately<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> gave<00:02:44.540> away<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> wrong<00:02:44.959> gun

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170

unfortunately I gave away the wrong gun
I<00:02:45.380> should<00:02:45.830> have<00:02:45.920> gave<00:02:46.040> him<00:02:46.190> away<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.730> shotgun

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
I should have gave him away the shotgun

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.910 
I should have gave him away the shotgun
because<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.750> could've<00:02:48.260> got<00:02:48.350> more<00:02:48.500> points<00:02:48.769> with

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
because I could've got more points with

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.970 
because I could've got more points with
the<00:02:49.580> other<00:02:49.840> pistol<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:51.050> regardless<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.950> still

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
ended up making half in this game so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.090 
ended up making half in this game so
they<00:02:53.870> ended<00:02:53.989> up<00:02:54.080> fast<00:02:54.560> before<00:02:54.769> during<00:02:55.010> this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.470 
part right here I'm just basically have
round<00:02:57.980> three<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.370> get<00:02:58.489> enough<00:02:58.730> points<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.209> get

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
round three to get enough points to get

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.850 
round three to get enough points to get
this<00:02:59.600> Juggernog<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.320> can<00:03:00.470> see<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> only

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
this Juggernog and you can see I only

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.729 
this Juggernog and you can see I only
have<00:03:01.070> 1350<00:03:01.970> but<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.209> still<00:03:02.480> have<00:03:02.720> one<00:03:03.350> more<00:03:03.500> tour

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
have 1350 but I still have one more tour

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.979 
have 1350 but I still have one more tour
to<00:03:03.829> open<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.370> that's<00:03:04.790> still<00:03:05.000> 2500<00:03:05.690> points<00:03:05.810> I

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
to open so that's still 2500 points I

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.960 
to open so that's still 2500 points I
need<00:03:06.019> to<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:07.310> from<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.579> zombies<00:03:07.880> in

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
need to get just from the zombies in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.970 
need to get just from the zombies in
round<00:03:08.150> 3<00:03:08.420> luckily<00:03:09.140> right<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:09.890> is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
round 3 luckily right there that this is

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.110 
round 3 luckily right there that this is
really<00:03:10.100> what<00:03:10.280> ended<00:03:10.430> up<00:03:10.549> doing<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:10.910> end<00:03:11.060> up

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
really what ended up doing it I end up

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300 
really what ended up doing it I end up
getting<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.420> 2x<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.769> didn't<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.160> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
getting a 2x and if I didn't get that to

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.380 
getting a 2x and if I didn't get that to
webside<00:03:13.700> probably<00:03:14.030> would<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.239> not<00:03:14.360> been

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
webside probably would have not been

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.390 
webside probably would have not been
able<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.750> make<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.049> happen<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.560> again<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.190> is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
able to make this happen but again it is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.860 
able to make this happen but again it is
some<00:03:16.579> dumb<00:03:16.730> luck<00:03:16.910> it's<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.239> repeatable<00:03:17.630> every

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
some dumb luck it's not repeatable every

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.569 
some dumb luck it's not repeatable every
single<00:03:18.110> time<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.500> for<00:03:19.220> those<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.370> are

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
single time but for those that are

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.270 
single time but for those that are
curious<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.450> trying<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.780> get<00:03:21.130> Juggernog<00:03:22.130> on

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
curious and trying to get Juggernog on

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.590 
curious and trying to get Juggernog on
the<00:03:22.370> release<00:03:22.610> around<00:03:22.730> possible<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.420> was

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
the release around possible like I was

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.690 
the release around possible like I was
curious<00:03:23.870> then<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.100> see<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.519> is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
curious then you can see that this is

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.729 
curious then you can see that this is
possible<00:03:26.090> now<00:03:26.180> round<00:03:26.630> four<00:03:26.870> super<00:03:27.320> easy<00:03:27.470> to

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
possible now round four super easy to

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.410 
possible now round four super easy to
get<00:03:27.860> Juggernog<00:03:28.250> by<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:28.730> just<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:29.390> through

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
get Juggernog by if you just go through

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.569 
get Juggernog by if you just go through
the<00:03:29.780> two<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> way<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.040> showed<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.489> guys

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
the two the way that I showed you guys

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.920 
the two the way that I showed you guys
there<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.540> see<00:03:32.660> right<00:03:32.750> here<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
there and you can see right here I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.449 
there and you can see right here I
already<00:03:33.260> have<00:03:33.350> enough<00:03:33.560> points<00:03:33.739> for<00:03:34.280> Juggernog

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
already have enough points for Juggernog

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.630 
already have enough points for Juggernog
you<00:03:34.730> needed<00:03:35.000> 2800<00:03:35.570> points<00:03:36.340> because<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.370> need

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
you needed 2800 points because you need

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.699 
you needed 2800 points because you need
well<00:03:37.820> 2,700<00:03:38.570> points<00:03:38.660> because<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.500> need<00:03:39.650> to

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
well 2,700 points because you need to

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.350 
well 2,700 points because you need to
turn<00:03:39.799> on<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> generator<00:03:40.489> first<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.090> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
turn on the generator first and the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.990 
turn on the generator first and the
generator<00:03:41.750> costs<00:03:42.590> 200<00:03:43.010> points<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.400> use<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.970> I

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
generator costs 200 points to use and I

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.360 
generator costs 200 points to use and I
believe<00:03:44.299> after<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.440> done<00:03:45.620> turning<00:03:46.220> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
believe after you get done turning the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.560 
believe after you get done turning the
generator<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.030> gives<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.329> couple

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
generator on it gives you a couple

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.140 
generator on it gives you a couple
hundred<00:03:47.750> points<00:03:48.110> as<00:03:48.260> well<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:50.000> be

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
hundred points as well but just to be

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.090 
hundred points as well but just to be
safe<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.690> ended<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:50.989> both<00:03:51.260> making<00:03:51.950> sure<00:03:52.070> I

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
safe I ended up in both making sure I

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.740 
safe I ended up in both making sure I
had<00:03:52.220> more<00:03:52.430> than<00:03:52.519> enough<00:03:52.579> points<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.299> make<00:03:53.630> it

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
had more than enough points to make it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.240 
had more than enough points to make it
happen<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.170> killing<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.920> couple<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.160> these
