00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.770
 hello good to all the successes lie 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 people I will teach today the clues that 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.960
 they are taking us to the new dlc 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.599
 there are things we see and things that we do not 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.880
 we see them you have to know how to look for them 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.029
 Well look carefully because this 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.489
 dock here and so many packages here 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.400
 posts and preparations that we just 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.610
 coming from a trip I do not think I think we 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.810
 let's go somewhere where we 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.350
 we go 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.930
 we do not know there are signs there are clues 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.660
 they tell you things and we're going to see them 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.940
 right now these packages are 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.420
 ready to go somewhere and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.850
 notice you remember live from my life of a 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.660
 video that I made two months ago in which 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.970
 samuel said this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.199
 I hope that you mine the scum of 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.199
 'Bermuda Triangle' 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.420
 incredible at that time we could not no 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.570
 we could safely take out that he could 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.790
 do that we could speculate if equal 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.450
 that now also but every time is more 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.100
 that's why samuel said that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.860
 'Bermuda triangle' I think 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.350
 let's go there but let's continue with 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.830
 the clues 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.200
 this for example drinks 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 I said about the purgatory mode and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 explain everything about the new purgatory 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.850
 because this was so it was brought by 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.240
 demon from the other dimension brought it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.120
 of the future yes it is true but apart from 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.610
 that this with the blink is you 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.730
 marking something else what happens is that a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.210
 true science 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.190
 the naked eye can not see it in my 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.810
 thought worth 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.270
 in my theory, look carefully if this 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.540
 We put it to rest , we put it still in 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.420
 a specific second is worth just when 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.690
 come out the little balls, look how they look 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 remain 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 imagine you can be this 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.220
 I see clearly that is when you see 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.740
 something under people when they are 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.490
 the little bubbles that 's like they're very 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.820
 oxygen bubbles 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.740
 and you see the image as that as if it 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.850
 were watching under the water are 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.630
 clues that are leaving us and put them 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.350
 so hidden that you have to look carefully 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.660
 and apart from the sound, fix the sound of 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.390
 background sea ​​sound of waves sound a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.990
 sound like the child talking will be 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.460
 teddy we do not know but soon what 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.220
 we will discover 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.460
 and let's go to the next track I'm going to 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.680
 recreate it well one gets the last 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.780
 the last skull that is going to be is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 right now it is achieved in the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.760
 last skull and look at the bridge what 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.730
 what you see in watching it falls suddenly from 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.610
 up, set that fire and fall towards 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.760
 down towards the sea because action falls 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.300
 towards the sea people if I had thrown it 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.920
 from the tomahawk towards the fire towards the 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.380
 wedding time towards the fireball that in 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.750
 the floor where the dog is 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.060
 say that it has gone down and that it is a 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.870
 failure of the game but it was not going up 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.410
 And look good in this music to 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.819
 where are we going 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.450
 is telling you where we are going 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.420
 we do not know but it may be another clue 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.430
 more this song is asking you and 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.859
 wants to give is that he wants 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.310
 investigate where we will go and why 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.450
 says why are we lost and why 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.920
 we are lost because in the Bermuda shorts 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.740
 you get lost and you do not know where you are 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.830
 that's why he says that to my understanding 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.080
 that's why I always know the image 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.630
 is in the port and the boxes 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.020
 preparing themselves packed to go to a 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.950
 destination there are more clues and more clues 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.910
 about this look at the detail of that 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.910
 first it was the fire so sweet 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:46.680
 then it was 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.680
 the wind in the heights of die race 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.470
 then it was not going back 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.950
 the earth the rock 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.840
 and finally to form the fourth 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.550
 element that would miss people 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.130
 Water 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.130
 and the water where it is in the vegetables 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.460
 and the vegetables below where they would take you 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.830
 that place 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.360
 people 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.169
 atlantic 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.670
 and I have one more clue and it will be tomorrow 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.200
 the prophecy 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.200
 until the next video 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.970
 Nereid god mines the dross of the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.970
 Bermuda Triangle
