300 plus pages I would actually do a
listing<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.860> major<00:02:14.160> events<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.970> all

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
happened on the night his neighbor's dog

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.809 
happened on the night his neighbor's dog
was<00:02:44.940> murdered<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.040> therefore<00:02:47.040> learns<00:02:47.579> not

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
was murdered and therefore learns not

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.120 
was murdered and therefore learns not
only<00:02:47.879> more<00:02:48.599> about<00:02:48.840> himself<00:02:49.079> but<00:02:49.739> about<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
only more about himself but about the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.500 
only more about himself but about the

community in which he lives

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.250 
community in which he lives
see<00:02:52.139> that<00:02:52.410> would<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:53.130> pitch<00:02:54.079> because<00:02:55.079> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
see that would be a pitch because it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.379 
see that would be a pitch because it
highlights<00:02:55.790> what's<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.239> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
important part of the story and it's the

what do we do about the ending
hopefully<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.819> will<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.090> kind<00:03:24.359> of<00:03:24.420> clear<00:03:24.810> at

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
hopefully it will be kind of clear at

hopefully it will be kind of clear at
this<00:03:25.170> point<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:25.889> just<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.340> case<00:03:26.549> it's<00:03:26.790> not<00:03:26.880> I'm

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
this point but just in case it's not I'm

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.720 
this point but just in case it's not I'm
gonna<00:03:27.450> simply<00:03:27.900> spell<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.349> out<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:29.430> pitch

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
