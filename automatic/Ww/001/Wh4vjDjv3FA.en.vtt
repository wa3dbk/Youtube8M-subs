just<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.590> fairly<00:01:54.590> easy<00:01:54.740> stage<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.119> band<00:01:56.330> is

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
just a fairly easy stage the band is

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.560 
just a fairly easy stage the band is
obviously<00:01:56.990> at<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.290> end<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:58.399> are<00:01:58.570> bunches

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
obviously at the end there are bunches

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.190 
obviously at the end there are bunches
of<00:01:59.720> bananas<00:01:59.810> little<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.530> think<00:02:00.830> over<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:01.399> man

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
of bananas little I think over there man

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.249 
of bananas little I think over there man
well<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.420> want<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.630> get<00:02:05.810> them<00:02:05.990> if<00:02:06.170> you

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
well if you want to get them if you

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.699 
well if you want to get them if you
think<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:07.039> go<00:02:07.850> right<00:02:08.030> ahead<00:02:08.709> remember

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
think you can go right ahead remember

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.680 
think you can go right ahead remember
the<00:02:09.860> whole<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.399> whole<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.940> tix<00:02:11.269> up<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.510> whole

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
the whole the whole is tix up the whole

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.290 
the whole the whole is tix up the whole
middle<00:02:12.019> so<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:13.310> either<00:02:13.519> together<00:02:14.000> later

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
middle so it's either together later

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.340 
middle so it's either together later
though<00:02:16.030> usually<00:02:17.030> all<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.810> only<00:02:17.930> 60

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
though usually all you have only 60

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.050 
though usually all you have only 60
seconds<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.800> work<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.280> sometimes<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.880> have

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
seconds to work with sometimes you have

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.840 
seconds to work with sometimes you have
to<00:02:20.180> earn<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:21.160> depends<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> stage<00:02:22.610> we're

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
to earn it depends the stage we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
to earn it depends the stage we're
talking<00:02:23.150> about<00:02:23.239> here<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:27.050> there<00:02:27.200> are<00:02:27.230> many

much<00:02:32.690> time<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.110> have<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:35.300> you're

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
much time you have what the you're

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.670 
much time you have what the you're
facing<00:02:35.780> advice<00:02:36.230> based<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.290> harder

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
facing advice based this is the harder

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.780 
facing advice based this is the harder
version<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:40.250> white<00:02:40.820> which<00:02:41.239> one

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
version of white which one

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
version of white which one
basically<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.879> same<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.450> no<00:02:45.720> barrier

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
basically the same just no barrier

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.479 
basically the same just no barrier
around<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.769> bridge<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.849> it's<00:02:48.360> not

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
around the bridge and this it's not

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:58.059 
around the bridge and this it's not
obviously<00:02:51.950> holy<00:02:52.950> balls<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.640> needed<00:02:53.970> I

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.229 

thought<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.310> sure<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.760> going<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> make

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
thought for sure I was going to make

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.369 
thought for sure I was going to make
that<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.840> did<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.040> why<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.250> say<00:03:02.549> five<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.120> mean

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
that but I did and why I say five I mean

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.220 
that but I did and why I say five I mean
396<00:03:04.379> whatever<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.220> said<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.629> 500

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
396 whatever I said that I have 500

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.149 
396 whatever I said that I have 500
already<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.530> was<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.799> whoa<00:03:08.129> that's<00:03:08.400> crazy

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
already I was like whoa that's crazy

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.970 
already I was like whoa that's crazy
yeah<00:03:11.159> obviously<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.970> one<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.650> actually<00:03:13.650> an

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
yeah obviously this one is actually an

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.729 
yeah obviously this one is actually an
example<00:03:14.549> holy<00:03:15.150> crow<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:16.260> move<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.500> for

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
example holy crow I just move that for

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.449 
example holy crow I just move that for
nothing<00:03:16.829> Hoyer<00:03:21.859> this<00:03:22.859> was<00:03:23.010> actually<00:03:23.220> an

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
nothing Hoyer this was actually an

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.930 
nothing Hoyer this was actually an
example<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.500> when<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.650> blue<00:03:25.950> goal<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> harder

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
example of when the blue goal is harder

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.449 
example of when the blue goal is harder
than<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.209> green<00:03:27.450> gold<00:03:28.310> obviously<00:03:29.310> if<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
than the green gold obviously if you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.610 
than the green gold obviously if you
don't<00:03:29.670> know<00:03:29.819> what<00:03:30.000> every<00:03:30.359> goal<00:03:30.599> is<00:03:30.629> that's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
don't know what every goal is that's

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.680 
don't know what every goal is that's
gonna<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.920> problem<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.760> follows<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.480> green

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
gonna be a problem it follows the green

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.099 
gonna be a problem it follows the green
red<00:03:33.870> platform<00:03:34.140> that's<00:03:34.829> gonna<00:03:34.980> hurt<00:03:35.159> hobble<00:03:36.109> if

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
red platform that's gonna hurt hobble if

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.130 
red platform that's gonna hurt hobble if
you<00:03:37.260> don't<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.620> try<00:03:37.890> that's<00:03:38.370> gonna<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.730> roll

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
you don't we try that's gonna be a roll

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.819 
you don't we try that's gonna be a roll
ready<00:03:41.329> yeah<00:03:42.329> but<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:43.109> blue<00:03:43.470> goal<00:03:43.709> is

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
ready yeah but that blue goal is

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.220 
ready yeah but that blue goal is
actually<00:03:44.159> harder<00:03:44.489> as<00:03:45.239> far<00:03:45.569> as<00:03:45.690> i<00:03:45.780> know<00:03:46.019> i<00:03:46.049> think

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
actually harder as far as i know i think

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.300 
actually harder as far as i know i think
it's<00:03:46.560> harder<00:03:46.859> i<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:49.200> i<00:03:49.349> did<00:03:49.530> not<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.130> do

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it's harder i just i did not just do

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.680 
it's harder i just i did not just do
that<00:03:50.340> we're<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.269> gonna<00:03:51.389> retry
