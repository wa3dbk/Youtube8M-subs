everything is pretty straightforward but
I'm<00:04:29.370> still<00:04:29.580> going<00:04:29.699> to<00:04:29.789> explain<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.919> an

I'm still going to explain that was an
ammo<00:04:32.280> capsule<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.770> handgun<00:04:35.280> if<00:04:35.699> you

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.140 
hold down c or your right mouse button
it<00:04:39.180> will<00:04:39.330> automatically<00:04:39.960> fire<00:04:40.850> but<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.970> can

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
it will automatically fire but you can

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.420 
it will automatically fire but you can
fire<00:04:42.360> faster<00:04:42.780> if<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:42.990> click<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:46.650> does<00:04:47.280> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
fire faster if you click it does the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.279 
fire faster if you click it does the
