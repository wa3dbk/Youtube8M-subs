so<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:01.949> know<00:00:02.070> conservatives<00:00:03.030> love<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.570> use

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so I know conservatives love to use

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.579 
so I know conservatives love to use
stories<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.710> order<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:06.350> explain<00:00:07.350> their

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
stories in order to explain their

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.730 
stories in order to explain their
theories<00:00:08.630> stories<00:00:09.630> are<00:00:09.780> very<00:00:09.900> powerful<00:00:10.590> way

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
theories stories are very powerful way

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.190 
theories stories are very powerful way
of<00:00:10.769> educating<00:00:11.340> people<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.210> stories<00:00:13.080> are

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
of educating people and stories are

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.770 
of educating people and stories are
probably<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> basic<00:00:14.099> unit<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.780> human

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
probably the basic unit of human

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.599 
probably the basic unit of human
understanding<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.830> there's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> problem<00:00:17.430> with

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
understanding but there's a problem with

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.609 
understanding but there's a problem with
using<00:00:17.760> stores<00:00:18.330> especially<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.320> used

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
using stores especially the one you used

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.670 
using stores especially the one you used
and<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.600> leaves<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and that is that it leaves out a lot of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.550 
and that is that it leaves out a lot of
the<00:00:22.920> factors<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.660> mathematically

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the factors it's not mathematically

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.730 
the factors it's not mathematically
accurate<00:00:25.970> now<00:00:26.970> let's<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.019> example<00:00:28.439> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
accurate now let's take this example you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.099 
accurate now let's take this example you
had<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.160> people<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> bar<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> let's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
had of people going to a bar and let's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.720 
had of people going to a bar and let's
say<00:00:31.380> instead<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.460> talking<00:00:32.669> about<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
say instead that we're talking about a

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.720 
say instead that we're talking about a
situation<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:37.730> investors

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
situation in which there are investors

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
situation in which there are investors
in<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.480> infrastructure<00:00:40.110> let's<00:00:40.320> say<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.800> number

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
in an infrastructure let's say a number

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
in an infrastructure let's say a number
of<00:00:41.610> people<00:00:41.870> own<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> company<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.800> they're

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of people own a company and they're

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
of people own a company and they're
investing<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> company<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.660> order<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
investing in the company in order to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.000 
investing in the company in order to
increase<00:00:46.289> productivity<00:00:46.789> all<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:48.000> now

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
increase productivity all right now

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.500 
increase productivity all right now
investing<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> productivity<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.149> boost

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
investing in the productivity will boost

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.500 
investing in the productivity will boost
the<00:00:51.660> output<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> question<00:00:52.829> becomes<00:00:53.510> who

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the output now the question becomes who

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.389 
the output now the question becomes who
gets<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.989> benefit<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.680> increased

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
gets the benefit of that increased

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.959 
gets the benefit of that increased
productivity<00:00:56.809> all<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.730> from<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
productivity all right and from that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
productivity all right and from that
based<00:01:00.629> upon<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.170> who<00:01:01.530> should<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> paying

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
based upon that who should be paying

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.039 
based upon that who should be paying
more<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.910> investment<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
more for the investment in the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.010 
more for the investment in the
infrastructure<00:01:04.640> well<00:01:06.799> what<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:07.979> find<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.580> that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
infrastructure well what we find is that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
infrastructure well what we find is that
over<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> past<00:01:10.170> three<00:01:10.619> decades<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
over the past three decades is that the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
over the past three decades is that the
increases<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.409> productivity<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.700> been

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
increases in productivity have not been

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
increases in productivity have not been
going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.390> labor<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.110> been<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
going to labor it's been going to the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.749 
going to labor it's been going to the
wealthy<00:01:18.030> okay<00:01:18.659> there's<00:01:19.290> been<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.299> pressure<00:01:21.299> on

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
wealthy okay there's been a pressure on

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.899 
wealthy okay there's been a pressure on
wages<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.630> has<00:01:24.900> made<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.530> such<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
wages that has made it such that the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
wages that has made it such that the
increases<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> productivity<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.380> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
increases in productivity that have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
increases in productivity that have
occurred<00:01:28.860> over<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> past<00:01:29.220> few<00:01:29.460> decades<00:01:29.640> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
occurred over the past few decades all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.859 
occurred over the past few decades all
of<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> gone<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> wealthy<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.390> the

of that is gone to the wealthy so the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
of that is gone to the wealthy so the

have benefited from the increases in

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700 
have benefited from the increases in
productivity<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> pressure

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.600 
productivity and because of the pressure
on<00:02:05.009> wages<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:06.329> labor<00:02:06.869> class<00:02:07.170> has<00:02:07.799> seen<00:02:08.129> none

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
on wages the labor class has seen none

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
on wages the labor class has seen none
of<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.819> none<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:10.649> you're

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
of that none of that so if you're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.070 
of that none of that so if you're
talking<00:02:11.099> about<00:02:11.250> fairness

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
talking about fairness

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.110 
talking about fairness
we<00:02:12.590> should<00:02:12.830> tax<00:02:13.210> people<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:15.800> who<00:02:16.580> benefit

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
we should tax people more who benefit

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.220 
we should tax people more who benefit
more<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.760> system<00:02:20.210> who<00:02:20.600> benefit<00:02:21.050> more

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
they should pay taxes okay so that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.290 
they should pay taxes okay so that's

that factor to let you know that the

factors that need to be taking into
account<00:03:11.570> all<00:03:12.530> right<00:03:12.709> that's<00:03:13.250> not<00:03:13.700> just

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
account all right that's not just

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.449

and that we do this out of charity okay

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.550 
and that we do this out of charity okay
that's<00:03:19.489> there's<00:03:20.180> also<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.959> taken<00:03:21.380> into

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that's there's also to be taken into

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.680 
that's there's also to be taken into
consideration<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.459> benefits<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.660> people

consideration the benefits that people

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.050 
consideration the benefits that people
derive<00:03:24.290> from<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.160> government<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:25.640> the

derive from the government and the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.030 
derive from the government and the
wealthy<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.450> been<00:03:26.840> deriving<00:03:27.260> increasingly

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
wealthy have been deriving increasingly

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.250 
wealthy have been deriving increasingly
more<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.459> more<00:03:28.670> benefit<00:03:29.060> particularly<00:03:29.720> in

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
more and more benefit particularly in

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.320 
more and more benefit particularly in
terms<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.489> way<00:03:31.640> they've<00:03:31.880> been<00:03:32.030> able<00:03:32.150> to

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
terms of the way they've been able to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
terms of the way they've been able to
put<00:03:32.840> pressure<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.320> keeping<00:03:33.620> wages<00:03:33.800> low<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
put pressure on keeping wages low and to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.590 
put pressure on keeping wages low and to
take<00:03:36.350> all<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.890> profits<00:03:37.400> due<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.120> productivity

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
take all the profits due to productivity

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.620 
take all the profits due to productivity
for<00:03:38.930> themselves<00:03:39.410> okay<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.519> they<00:03:40.730> benefit<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
for themselves okay so they benefit the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.199 
for themselves okay so they benefit the
most<00:03:41.810> from<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.830> system<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.430> is<00:03:43.640> okay

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
most from the system the way it is okay

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.960 
most from the system the way it is okay
they<00:03:44.480> should<00:03:44.750> be<00:03:44.870> under<00:03:45.680> obligation<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.700> pay

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
they should be under obligation to pay

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.790 
they should be under obligation to pay
more<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.510> that's<00:03:48.050> all<00:03:48.200> I'm<00:03:48.350> going<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.500> say<00:03:48.560> for

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
more so that's all I'm going to say for

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.830 
more so that's all I'm going to say for
now
