that's it that's how you do it right
there<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:04.479> really<00:02:04.810> very<00:02:04.930> simple<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.759> lead

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
there it's really very simple the lead

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.359 
there it's really very simple the lead
is<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.600> lead<00:02:07.780> count<00:02:08.050> starts<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.560> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
is the lead count starts out that the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.250 
is the lead count starts out that the
finish<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.209> goes<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.899> does<00:02:11.020> whatever

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
finish is kind of goes and does whatever

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
finish is kind of goes and does whatever
so<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.739> know<00:02:11.830> I'm<00:02:12.160> starting<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.910> lead<00:02:13.090> with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so you know I'm starting to lead with

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.570 
so you know I'm starting to lead with
that<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.440> then<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.739> just<00:02:14.890> kind<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.100> move<00:02:15.250> up<00:02:15.430> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
that and then I just kind of move up and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.520 
that and then I just kind of move up and
improvise

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
improvise

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.440 
improvise
after<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> go<00:02:17.770> one<00:02:18.010> time<00:02:18.280> through<00:02:18.580> with<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
after I go one time through with that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.940 
after I go one time through with that
little<00:02:19.630> lick<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.530> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
