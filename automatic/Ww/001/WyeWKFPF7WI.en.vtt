a<00:00:00.319> computer<00:00:01.319> by<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.530> name<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:01.979> Eugene<00:00:02.190> because

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
a computer by the name of Eugene because

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.539 
a computer by the name of Eugene because
what<00:00:03.179> other<00:00:03.330> name<00:00:03.540> would<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> computer<00:00:04.049> have

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
what other name would a computer have

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.700 
what other name would a computer have
passed<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.970> Turing<00:00:06.240> test<00:00:06.420> which<00:00:07.020> basically

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
passed the Turing test which basically

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.910 
passed the Turing test which basically
means<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:09.110> simulated<00:00:10.110> humored<00:00:10.410> human

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
means it simulated humored human

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.570 
means it simulated humored human

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.120 
conversation as a thirteen-year-old boy
we've<00:00:14.580> got<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> little<00:00:14.910> more<00:00:15.059> info<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.130> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we've got a little more info for you the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
we've got a little more info for you the
Turing<00:00:17.609> test<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.570> tests<00:00:19.140> artificial

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
Turing test which tests artificial

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.170 
Turing test which tests artificial
intelligence<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.160> introduced<00:00:20.609> by<00:00:20.789> Alan

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
intelligence was introduced by Alan

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.390 
intelligence was introduced by Alan
Turing<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.779> 1950<00:00:22.590> he<00:00:22.980> predicted<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
Turing in 1950 he predicted that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
Turing in 1950 he predicted that
computers<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.300> day<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:25.170> able<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> be

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
computers would one day be able to be

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.589 
computers would one day be able to be
programmed<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.279> acquire<00:00:26.580> abilities<00:00:27.060> rivaling

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
programmed to acquire abilities rivaling

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
programmed to acquire abilities rivaling
human<00:00:28.199> intelligence<00:00:28.470> we're<00:00:28.890> pretty<00:00:29.070> much

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
human intelligence we're pretty much

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.040 
human intelligence we're pretty much
right<00:00:29.400> there<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.849> person<00:00:30.449> engages<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
right there a person engages in a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
right there a person engages in a
text-based<00:00:31.439> conversation<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.369> another

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
text-based conversation with another

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
text-based conversation with another
person<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> computer<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> must<00:00:34.350> determine

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
person and a computer and must determine

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.620 
person and a computer and must determine
which<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.670> they're<00:00:35.850> unable<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> do

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
which is which if they're unable to do

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
which is which if they're unable to do
so<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.989> computer<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.410> deemed<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.340> passed

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so the computer is deemed to have passed

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
so the computer is deemed to have passed
it<00:00:39.420> requires<00:00:39.780> 30<00:00:40.140> percent<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> human

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it requires 30 percent of human

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
it requires 30 percent of human
interrogators<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.540> duped<00:00:42.780> during

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
interrogators to be duped during

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
interrogators to be duped during
five-minute<00:00:43.559> keyboard<00:00:43.890> conversations<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
five-minute keyboard conversations so I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
five-minute keyboard conversations so I
feel<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.239> we've<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.539> before<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.289> into

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
feel like we've all before we get into

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.750 
feel like we've all before we get into
the<00:00:46.559> specifics<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> feel<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.610> we've

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the specifics of this feel like we've

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
the specifics of this feel like we've
all<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:48.180> these<00:00:48.690> experiences<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.590> these

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
all had these experiences with these

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.130 
all had these experiences with these
computers<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.870> Time

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
computers like if you go on to like Time

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
computers like if you go on to like Time
Warner<00:00:52.530> chat<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> try<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> find<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:53.820> out

Warner chat to try to find something out

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
Warner chat to try to find something out
and<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.690> literally<00:00:55.140> can't<00:00:55.680> tell<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.550> you're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and you literally can't tell if you're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
and you literally can't tell if you're
talking<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> does<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.199> surprise<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
talking to so does this surprise you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
talking to so does this surprise you
that<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.370> test<00:00:59.670> has<00:00:59.969> been<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.140> been

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that this test has been what I have been

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
that this test has been what I have been
what<00:01:01.800> I've<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:02.010> reading<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.460> online

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
what I've been reading about this online

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.370 
what I've been reading about this online
is<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> hoax<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.379> guy

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
is that it this is a hoax that this guy

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.300 
is that it this is a hoax that this guy
no<00:01:07.380> yeah<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.710> guy<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.010> Reading<00:01:08.280> University

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
no yeah this guy at Reading University

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
no yeah this guy at Reading University
is<00:01:08.790> apparently<00:01:09.090> infamous<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:10.020> sort<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is apparently infamous for these sort of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.179 
is apparently infamous for these sort of
things<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.619> he<00:01:10.740> claimed<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
things I think he claimed to be the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.530 
things I think he claimed to be the
first<00:01:11.460> human<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:11.970> infected<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
first human to be infected with a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.020 
first human to be infected with a
computer<00:01:12.930> virus<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> apparently<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> lot

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
computer virus and that apparently a lot

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.429 
computer virus and that apparently a lot
of<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.689> been<00:01:15.810> sort<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> gullibly

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
of people have been sort of gullibly

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
of people have been sort of gullibly
kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> reporting<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.759> story<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
kind of reporting this story but it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 
kind of reporting this story but it's
not<00:01:18.750> true<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> seemed<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.070> seems<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.460> it's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
not true so it seemed it seems like it's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
not true so it seemed it seems like it's
half<00:01:20.850> true<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.540> apparently<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.170> did<00:01:22.500> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
half true that apparently this did it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
half true that apparently this did it
did<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.580> pass<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:24.960> some

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
did actually pass but there's some

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.460 
did actually pass but there's some
questions<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.830> his<00:01:26.009> methodology<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
questions about his methodology so I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
questions about his methodology so I
don't<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.920> too<00:01:29.100> focused<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
don't want to get too focused on that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.429 
don't want to get too focused on that
just<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> broader<00:01:30.780> broader<00:01:31.020> idea<00:01:31.320> by

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
just more the broader broader idea by

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.550 
just more the broader broader idea by
the<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.650> real<00:01:32.070> quick<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.400> Alan<00:01:32.939> Turing<00:01:33.780> he

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the way real quick about Alan Turing he

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
the way real quick about Alan Turing he
was<00:01:34.710> persecuted<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.400> homosexuality<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
was persecuted for homosexuality and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.969 
was persecuted for homosexuality and
after<00:01:37.320> he<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.560> convicted<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.220> 1952<00:01:39.140> he<00:01:40.140> was

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
after he was convicted in 1952 he was

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.450 
after he was convicted in 1952 he was
chemically<00:01:41.479> castrated<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.740> little<00:01:43.740> something

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
chemically castrated a little something

starring<00:01:52.409> Benedict<00:01:52.740> Cumberbatch<00:01:53.070> coming<00:01:53.399> out

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
starring Benedict Cumberbatch coming out

starring Benedict Cumberbatch coming out
this<00:01:53.610> year<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.210> hopefully<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this year really hopefully at that and I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
this year really hopefully at that and I
think<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> stamp<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:57.000> him<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.210> due<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
think a stamp will get him his due I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719 
think a stamp will get him his due I
think<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.170> no<00:01:58.350> Alan<00:01:58.770> Turing<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
think but yeah no Alan Turing is a what

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
think but yeah no Alan Turing is a what
is<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> you're<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.450> smart<00:02:00.840> gay<00:02:01.590> people

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is it you're really smart gay people

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
is it you're really smart gay people
because<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> guy<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> beautiful<00:02:03.149> mind

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
because the guy from a beautiful mind

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.300 
because the guy from a beautiful mind
also<00:02:03.780> although<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> movie<00:02:04.799> made<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> seem

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
also although the movie made it seem

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.910 
also although the movie made it seem
like<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.990> wasn't<00:02:07.140> he<00:02:07.320> gay<00:02:07.469> uh<00:02:08.069> yeah<00:02:08.459> we're

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
like it wasn't he gay uh yeah we're

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.380 
like it wasn't he gay uh yeah we're
you<00:02:08.979> know<00:02:09.099> smarter<00:02:09.849> gay<00:02:09.940> guys<00:02:10.090> are<00:02:10.240> good<00:02:10.360> with

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
you know smarter gay guys are good with

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.559 
you know smarter gay guys are good with
numbers<00:02:10.599> I<00:02:10.840> don't<00:02:11.760> okay<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:12.940> going<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
numbers I don't okay so going back to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.059 
numbers I don't okay so going back to
this<00:02:13.750> without<00:02:14.020> getting<00:02:14.260> too<00:02:14.440> much<00:02:14.470> into<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
this without getting too much into the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.380 
this without getting too much into the
to<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> specifics<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.060> test<00:02:16.239> because

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to the specifics of the test because

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.420 
to the specifics of the test because
it's<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> little<00:02:16.780> unclear<00:02:16.989> as<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> said<00:02:17.470> when<00:02:18.340> are

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it's a little unclear as I said when are

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's a little unclear as I said when are
the<00:02:18.489> robots<00:02:18.610> taking<00:02:18.970> over<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.660> somehow

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the robots taking over as I somehow

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690 
the robots taking over as I somehow
asked<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.349> this<00:02:20.470> show<00:02:20.709> every<00:02:21.160> week<00:02:21.370> what's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
asked on this show every week what's

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.740 
asked on this show every week what's
interesting<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.120> Ray<00:02:22.330> Kurzweil

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
interesting is that Ray Kurzweil

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.420 
interesting is that Ray Kurzweil
particularly<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.380> would<00:02:23.560> happen<00:02:23.770> by<00:02:23.860> 2029

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
particularly this would happen by 2029

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.870 
particularly this would happen by 2029
obviously<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> lot<00:02:25.690> sooner<00:02:26.110> than<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.459> that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
obviously a lot sooner than I think that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.729 
obviously a lot sooner than I think that
well<00:02:28.390> no<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.600> mean<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.110> know<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:32.200> made<00:02:32.350> Chris

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
well no I mean you know you made Chris

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.040 
well no I mean you know you made Chris
well<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.670> 50s<00:02:34.060> guy<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.600> know<00:02:34.720> from

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
well that like the 50s guy you know from

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:45.570 
well that like the 50s guy you know from
outer<00:02:35.830> space<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.489> old<00:02:36.910> TV<00:02:37.209> psychic<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:44.580> think

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
outer space the old TV psychic I think

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.150 
outer space the old TV psychic I think
we<00:02:45.640> need<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.880> redefine<00:02:46.150> how<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:46.620> how<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:47.680> define

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
we need to redefine how we how we define

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.740 
we need to redefine how we how we define
artificial<00:02:48.940> intelligence<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.600> mean

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
artificial intelligence you know I mean

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.789 
artificial intelligence you know I mean
obviously<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> test<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.620> was

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
obviously this is a test that was

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.309 
obviously this is a test that was
devised<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.370> 1950<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.569> lot<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.959> those<00:02:53.080> ideas

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
devised in 1950 so a lot of those ideas

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.690 
devised in 1950 so a lot of those ideas
you<00:02:53.620> know<00:02:53.709> whenever<00:02:53.950> they<00:02:54.069> tried<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.310> predict

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you know whenever they tried to predict

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.940 
you know whenever they tried to predict
the<00:02:54.790> future<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.269> 50s<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.780> ends<00:02:56.290> up<00:02:56.410> looking

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the future in the 50s it ends up looking

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.000 
the future in the 50s it ends up looking
ludicrous

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.870 

well<00:03:00.580> yeah<00:03:01.769> but<00:03:02.769> uh<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.250> know<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.700> it's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
well yeah but uh you know I think it's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.150 
well yeah but uh you know I think it's
um<00:03:04.120> what's<00:03:04.390> interesting<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.160> this

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
um what's interesting is that this

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.729 
um what's interesting is that this
device<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:07.480> they<00:03:07.600> told<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.200> patent<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
device what they told the patent the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.440 
device what they told the patent the
jury<00:03:08.950> panel<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.700> was<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.819> 13<00:03:10.150> year<00:03:10.269> old<00:03:10.299> boy

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
jury panel that it was a 13 year old boy

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.000 
jury panel that it was a 13 year old boy
in<00:03:10.720> English<00:03:11.049> was<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.260> his<00:03:11.560> first<00:03:11.739> language

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
in English was not his first language

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.520 
in English was not his first language
automatic<00:03:12.819> cranium<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.750> quickly<00:03:13.989> yeah

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
automatic cranium is you quickly yeah

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.009 
automatic cranium is you quickly yeah
and<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.090> don't<00:03:16.209> think<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.600> surprise

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
and and so I don't think it's a surprise

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.949 
and and so I don't think it's a surprise
that<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.890> he<00:03:18.370> won<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:19.870> was

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
that that he won you know and but it was

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.750 
that that he won you know and but it was
hardly<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.320> supercomputer<00:03:20.769> was<00:03:21.070> an<00:03:21.160> algorithm

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
hardly a supercomputer was an algorithm

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.550 
hardly a supercomputer was an algorithm
that<00:03:21.790> was<00:03:22.000> designed<00:03:22.329> to<00:03:22.450> be<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> chatbot<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.380> by

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
that was designed to be a chatbot and by

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.599 
that was designed to be a chatbot and by
the<00:03:23.620> way<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:23.859> isn't<00:03:24.070> even<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.280> first<00:03:24.310> time

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
the way this isn't even the first time

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.030 
the way this isn't even the first time
that<00:03:24.820> happened<00:03:25.209> robot<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.109> 2011<00:03:26.769> called<00:03:26.890> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
that happened robot in 2011 called a

technology has amazing things to offer
and<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.280> know<00:04:35.670> it's<00:04:35.970> it's<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:36.960> gets<00:04:37.140> sort

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
and you know it's it's it just gets sort

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.570 
and you know it's it's it just gets sort
of<00:04:37.440> out<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.560> hand<00:04:37.650> when<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.070> media<00:04:38.310> takes

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
of out of hand when the media takes

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.250 
of out of hand when the media takes
something<00:04:38.760> that's<00:04:38.880> not<00:04:39.090> really<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.480> story<00:04:39.780> and

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
something that's not really a story and

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.810 
something that's not really a story and
you<00:04:40.560> know<00:04:40.590> blows<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.220> out<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.340> proportion<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
you know blows it out of proportion the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.550 
you know blows it out of proportion the
way<00:04:41.910> they<00:04:42.000> did<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:42.440> supercomputer<00:04:43.440> but

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
way they did with this supercomputer but

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.810 
way they did with this supercomputer but
I<00:04:43.650> do<00:04:43.710> think<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.190> at<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.460> end<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.700> day

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
I do think that at the end of the day

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.860 
I do think that at the end of the day
we're<00:04:45.330> heading<00:04:45.570> in<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.720> right<00:04:45.810> direction

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
we're heading in the right direction

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.720 
we're heading in the right direction
yeah<00:04:47.240> yeah<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.690> know<00:04:48.810> III<00:04:49.470> wish<00:04:50.190> Google<00:04:50.610> would

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
yeah yeah you know III wish Google would
