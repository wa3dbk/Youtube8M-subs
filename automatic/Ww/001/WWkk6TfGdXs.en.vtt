and now it has like six or seven or
something<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.490> big<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.909> i<00:01:53.970> love

something and it's really big so i love
that<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.009> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that and then over here I have this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
that and then over here I have this
little<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.540> rock<00:01:58.140> basically<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
little this little on rock basically and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.670 
little this little on rock basically and
it<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.909> these<00:02:00.299> other<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.899> pieces<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it has like these other little pieces of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
it has like these other little pieces of
wood<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.009> were<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.430> twine<00:02:03.030> intertwined

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
wood that were like twine intertwined

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.959 
wood that were like twine intertwined
together<00:02:04.140> until<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> rope<00:02:05.490> almost

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
together until like this rope almost

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
together until like this rope almost
that<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.570> put<00:02:06.780> through<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> hole<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> rock

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that was put through a hole in the rock

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.650 
that was put through a hole in the rock
so<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.369> rope<00:02:08.640> structure<00:02:09.149> but

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so it's like this rope structure but

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.350 
so it's like this rope structure but
it's<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:09.929> rigid<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.470> then

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
it's like rigid and then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.260 
it's like rigid and then
here<00:02:11.510> i<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:12.610> java<00:02:13.610> fern<00:02:13.850> i<00:02:14.000> think<00:02:14.150> it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
here i have java fern i think it's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.690 
here i have java fern i think it's
called<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.540> java<00:02:14.870> fern<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.400> basically<00:02:16.400> all<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
called a java fern and basically all the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.080 
called a java fern and basically all the
way<00:02:16.790> around<00:02:16.910> I'd<00:02:17.270> been<00:02:17.420> attaching<00:02:18.020> new<00:02:19.090> little

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
way around I'd been attaching new little

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.660 
way around I'd been attaching new little
mini<00:02:20.840> plants<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> side<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.370> hopes

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
mini plants on the side of it in hopes

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.210 
mini plants on the side of it in hopes
that<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.940> would<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.410> spread<00:02:24.410> down<00:02:24.800> across

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
that it would like spread down across

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.950 
that it would like spread down across
until<00:02:25.700> I'd<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:25.970> liked<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> whole<00:02:26.480> circle<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
until I'd have liked the whole circle of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.810 
until I'd have liked the whole circle of
it<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.260> my<00:02:27.710> goldfish<00:02:28.040> actually<00:02:28.370> really<00:02:28.640> love

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it and my goldfish actually really love

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.030 
it and my goldfish actually really love
like<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.330> through<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.960> they<00:02:30.830> really

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
like going through this and they really

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.760 
like going through this and they really
have<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> lot<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.310> fun<00:02:31.490> with<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> yeah<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.530> um

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
have a lot of fun with it so yeah so um

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620 
have a lot of fun with it so yeah so um
that's<00:02:34.340> pretty<00:02:34.670> much<00:02:34.820> what's<00:02:35.090> been<00:02:35.270> happening

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
that's pretty much what's been happening

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.870 
that's pretty much what's been happening
inside<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.230> tank<00:02:36.440> now<00:02:36.980> about<00:02:37.430> things<00:02:37.640> outside

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
inside the tank now about things outside

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
inside the tank now about things outside
of<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.570> things<00:02:38.810> maybe<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.320> will

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of it just things maybe that will

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.010 
of it just things maybe that will
probably<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:40.130> coming<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.550> future<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:41.120> my

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
probably be coming in the future is my

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.080 
probably be coming in the future is my
light<00:02:42.260> fixture<00:02:42.740> I've<00:02:43.520> been<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:43.970> thinking

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
light fixture I've been really thinking

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.290 
light fixture I've been really thinking
about<00:02:44.420> upgrading<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> while<00:02:45.620> now<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
about upgrading this for a while now and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.210 
about upgrading this for a while now and
if<00:02:47.300> you've<00:02:47.750> seen<00:02:47.900> my<00:02:48.080> previous<00:02:48.290> videos<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
if you've seen my previous videos you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.090 
if you've seen my previous videos you
know<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.610> got<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.000> new<00:02:50.060> coralife<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:51.100> 24

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
know that I got this new coralife a 24

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.570 
know that I got this new coralife a 24
inch<00:02:52.130> light<00:02:52.940> fixture<00:02:53.390> which<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:54.280> 224<00:02:55.280> watt

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
inch light fixture which has 224 watt

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.090 
inch light fixture which has 224 watt
bulbs<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.600> then<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.230> also<00:02:57.380> have<00:02:57.800> this

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
bulbs in it and then I also have this

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.460 
bulbs in it and then I also have this
30-inch<00:02:58.760> light<00:02:59.570> fixture<00:02:59.930> which<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.320> a

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
30-inch light fixture which is just a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.930 
30-inch light fixture which is just a
fluorescent<00:03:00.980> light<00:03:01.100> fixture<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.430> came<00:03:01.790> with

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
fluorescent light fixture that came with

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.030 
fluorescent light fixture that came with
the<00:03:02.060> aquarium<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.860> only<00:03:04.070> has<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:06.040> 120

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the aquarium and but it only has a 120

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.710 
the aquarium and but it only has a 120
watt<00:03:07.430> bulb<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.970> think<00:03:08.180> or<00:03:08.270> something<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.630> that

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
watt bulb I think or something like that

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.860 
watt bulb I think or something like that
so<00:03:09.290> basically<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.340> amounts<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.760> not<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> lot<00:03:11.600> of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
so basically it amounts to not a lot of

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.789 
so basically it amounts to not a lot of
light<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.250> about<00:03:13.430> 60<00:03:14.120> 60<00:03:14.900> some<00:03:15.140> watts<00:03:15.620> of

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
light it's about 60 60 some watts of

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.940 
light it's about 60 60 some watts of
light<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.580> 55<00:03:17.060> gallon<00:03:17.269> tank<00:03:17.600> which<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.950> just

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
light for a 55 gallon tank which is just

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.610 
light for a 55 gallon tank which is just
a<00:03:19.070> tiny<00:03:19.250> bit<00:03:19.370> over<00:03:19.820> 1<00:03:20.630> watt<00:03:20.900> per<00:03:21.140> gallon<00:03:21.470> which

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
a tiny bit over 1 watt per gallon which

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.500 
a tiny bit over 1 watt per gallon which
is<00:03:21.769> frankly<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.519> enough<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> really<00:03:23.480> want

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
is frankly not enough so I really want

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.449 
is frankly not enough so I really want
to<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:23.750> around<00:03:23.989> 100<00:03:24.530> watts<00:03:24.769> in<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.100> new<00:03:25.280> light

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
to get around 100 watts in a new light

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.470 
to get around 100 watts in a new light
fixture<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:27.549> I've<00:03:28.549> been<00:03:28.730> having<00:03:29.000> difficulty

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
fixture and I've been having difficulty

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.910 
fixture and I've been having difficulty
finding<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.900> light<00:03:30.049> fixture<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.470> want<00:03:30.769> though

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
finding a light fixture I want though

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.190 
finding a light fixture I want though
because<00:03:31.160> my<00:03:31.820> tank<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.450> as<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:32.840> see<00:03:32.989> it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
because my tank is as you can see it's

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.310 
because my tank is as you can see it's
really<00:03:33.530> it's<00:03:33.799> really<00:03:34.280> deep<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.049> it's

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
really it's really deep but then it's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.490 
really it's really deep but then it's
not<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.860> not<00:03:37.299> long<00:03:38.299> at<00:03:38.480> all<00:03:38.600> because<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.440> just

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
not it's not long at all because I just

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.780 
not it's not long at all because I just
wanted<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.040> fit<00:03:40.280> right<00:03:40.459> here<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
wanted it to fit right here in the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.420 
wanted it to fit right here in the
corner<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:41.780> room<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.739> then<00:03:42.950> what<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.190> did

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
corner of this room so then what I did

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.360 
corner of this room so then what I did
is<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:44.260> what<00:03:45.260> happened<00:03:45.620> as<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.799> ended<00:03:46.130> up<00:03:46.190> getting

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
is I what happened as I ended up getting

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.360 
is I what happened as I ended up getting
this<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:47.260> aquarium<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:48.440> only<00:03:48.590> 30<00:03:48.950> inches

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
this on aquarium that's only 30 inches

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.430 
this on aquarium that's only 30 inches
across<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:50.780> really<00:03:50.959> hard<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.410> a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
across so it's really hard to get a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.920 
across so it's really hard to get a
light<00:03:51.739> fixture<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.720> length

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
light fixture that is that length

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.960 
light fixture that is that length
because<00:03:54.290> most<00:03:54.530> light<00:03:54.709> fixtures<00:03:55.100> come<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.489> 24

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
because most light fixtures come in 24

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.400 
because most light fixtures come in 24
inches<00:03:56.150> which<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.570> one<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.989> see<00:03:57.260> you

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
inches which is this one so you see you

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.440 
inches which is this one so you see you
like<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.920> room<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.370> both<00:03:58.700> ends<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.239> of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
like I have room on both ends here of

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.830 
like I have room on both ends here of
the<00:04:00.170> light<00:04:00.290> fixture<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.840> they

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the light fixture so I have they

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.039 
the light fixture so I have they
normally<00:04:03.260> come<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.500> 24<00:04:04.010> inches<00:04:04.390> 36<00:04:05.390> inches<00:04:05.780> or

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
normally come in 24 inches 36 inches or

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.069 
normally come in 24 inches 36 inches or
48<00:04:06.530> inches<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.160> 36<00:04:08.150> inches<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:08.600> won't<00:04:08.840> fit

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
48 inches and 36 inches just won't fit

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.170 
48 inches and 36 inches just won't fit
because<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:09.530> wall<00:04:09.860> here<00:04:10.070> so<00:04:10.640> I'd<00:04:10.790> have<00:04:10.820> to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
because of this wall here so I'd have to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.270 
because of this wall here so I'd have to
I<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.780> 24<00:04:12.260> inch<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.890> that's<00:04:13.070> really

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
I have to get a 24 inch so that's really

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.850 
I have to get a 24 inch so that's really
like<00:04:13.579> narrowed<00:04:14.060> my<00:04:14.090> possibilities<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:15.230> well

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
like narrowed my possibilities as well

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.920 
like narrowed my possibilities as well
as<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.160> ups<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.669> crop<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.239> cost<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.810> the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
as the ups the crop the cost of the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.500 
as the ups the crop the cost of the
light<00:04:18.229> fixture<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.650> lot<00:04:18.859> because<00:04:19.520> you<00:04:19.910> get<00:04:20.239> what

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
light fixture a lot because you get what

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.960 
light fixture a lot because you get what
you<00:04:20.539> do<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.289> to<00:04:21.440> get<00:04:21.560> more<00:04:21.739> bulbs<00:04:22.070> for

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
you do you have to get more bulbs for

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.690 
you do you have to get more bulbs for
the<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:24.169> shorter

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
the the shorter

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.880 
the the shorter
stands<00:04:24.910> for<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.150> 24<00:04:25.540> inches<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.170> then

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
stands for the 24 inches then and then

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.880 
stands for the 24 inches then and then
also<00:04:27.130> my<00:04:27.610> aquarium<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.390> not<00:04:28.660> as<00:04:28.900> like<00:04:29.410> it's

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
also my aquarium it's not as like it's

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.410 
also my aquarium it's not as like it's
not<00:04:30.130> very<00:04:30.280> wide<00:04:30.550> this<00:04:30.760> is<00:04:30.940> about<00:04:31.120> 10<00:04:31.390> inches

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
not very wide this is about 10 inches

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.850 
not very wide this is about 10 inches
from<00:04:31.990> here<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> back<00:04:33.550> where<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.300> um

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
from here to the back where the like um

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.860 
from here to the back where the like um
where<00:04:35.860> my<00:04:36.010> filter<00:04:36.520> input<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:36.910> output<00:04:37.180> are<00:04:37.210> so

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
where my filter input and output are so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.080 
where my filter input and output are so
I<00:04:37.900> only<00:04:38.110> have<00:04:38.350> about<00:04:38.470> 10<00:04:38.830> inches<00:04:38.860> here<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:39.790> most

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
I only have about 10 inches here so most

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.150 
I only have about 10 inches here so most
of<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> light<00:04:40.450> fixtures<00:04:40.900> are<00:04:41.110> just<00:04:41.140> 10<00:04:41.860> inches

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
of the light fixtures are just 10 inches

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.940 
of the light fixtures are just 10 inches
across<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.490> then<00:04:42.820> 24<00:04:43.270> inches<00:04:43.540> long<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.560> it

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
across and then 24 inches long so it

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.010 
across and then 24 inches long so it
would<00:04:45.130> be<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:46.030> would<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.240> really<00:04:46.510> tight<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.990> fit

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
would be it would be really tight to fit

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.540 
would be it would be really tight to fit
on<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.320> top<00:04:47.530> of<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.770> aquarium<00:04:48.190> but<00:04:48.520> I

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
on the top of the aquarium but I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.070 
on the top of the aquarium but I
definitely<00:04:48.940> want<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.270> get<00:04:49.390> just<00:04:49.660> one<00:04:49.870> light

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
definitely want to get just one light

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.530 
definitely want to get just one light
fixture<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.850> one<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:51.970> them<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.210> I've<00:04:52.300> really

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
fixture and one of them that I've really

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.890 
fixture and one of them that I've really
been<00:04:52.720> looking<00:04:52.780> at<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.830> Nova<00:04:54.190> extreme<00:04:54.900> 24

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
been looking at is the Nova extreme 24

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.150 
been looking at is the Nova extreme 24
inch<00:04:56.080> light<00:04:56.860> fixture<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.880> has<00:04:58.800> 33<00:04:59.800> bulbs

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
inch light fixture and it has 33 bulbs

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.100 
inch light fixture and it has 33 bulbs
in<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.610> gives<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.970> total<00:05:01.150> of<00:05:01.390> ninety<00:05:01.840> six

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
in it that gives a total of ninety six

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.850 
in it that gives a total of ninety six
wats<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:04.020> don't<00:05:05.020> know<00:05:05.080> that<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.410> like<00:05:05.560> 22

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
wats so I don't know that is like 22

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.280 
wats so I don't know that is like 22
watts<00:05:06.220> each<00:05:06.550> or<00:05:07.240> something<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:10.170> can't<00:05:11.170> yet<00:05:11.260> I

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
watts each or something I can't yet I

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.930 
watts each or something I can't yet I
can't<00:05:11.560> do<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.800> math<00:05:11.920> right<00:05:12.100> now<00:05:12.250> that's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
can't do the math right now that's

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.360 
can't do the math right now that's
that's<00:05:13.270> killing<00:05:13.510> okay<00:05:13.960> sorry<00:05:14.410> so<00:05:14.950> yeah<00:05:15.160> so

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
overall wattage of that picture so i

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.560 
overall wattage of that picture so i
might<00:05:21.430> beginning<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.970> but<00:05:22.180> that's<00:05:22.360> about

guys show you guys another video if i do
that<00:05:28.320> something<00:05:29.320> else<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.560> wanted<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.890> talk

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
that something else I wanted to talk

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.460 
that something else I wanted to talk
about<00:05:30.100> was<00:05:30.340> also<00:05:31.000> my<00:05:31.300> filter<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.170> I've<00:05:32.290> had

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
about was also my filter that I've had

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.250 
about was also my filter that I've had
here<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:33.730> seems<00:05:34.060> like<00:05:34.240> there's<00:05:34.720> been<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.960> big

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
here it seems like there's been a big

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.140 
here it seems like there's been a big
decrease<00:05:35.680> in<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.220> output<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.790> filter

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
decrease in the output of this filter

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.510 
decrease in the output of this filter
over<00:05:37.390> time<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:38.560> knew<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:38.770> like<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.460> course

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
over time and I knew that like of course

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.640 
over time and I knew that like of course
that's<00:05:39.760> a<00:05:39.940> obviously<00:05:40.870> gonna<00:05:41.020> happen<00:05:41.440> with

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
that's a obviously gonna happen with

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.230 
that's a obviously gonna happen with
filters<00:05:42.040> as<00:05:42.220> they<00:05:42.370> get<00:05:42.490> older<00:05:42.670> but<00:05:43.060> it's

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
filters as they get older but it's

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.360 
filters as they get older but it's
really<00:05:43.480> annoying<00:05:43.750> because<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.830> filter<00:05:45.340> is

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
really annoying because this filter is

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.330 
really annoying because this filter is
only<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:46.500> year<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> half<00:05:47.860> old<00:05:48.070> I<00:05:48.280> think

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
only a year and a half old I think

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.130 
only a year and a half old I think
something<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:49.390> thats<00:05:49.570> only<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.900> year<00:05:50.050> and

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
something like thats only a year and

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.990 
something like thats only a year and
half<00:05:50.200> old<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:50.710> I'm<00:05:51.040> kind<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.340> disappointed<00:05:51.610> by

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
half old so I'm kind of disappointed by

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.720 
half old so I'm kind of disappointed by
the<00:05:52.060> decrease<00:05:52.570> in<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.930> amount<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:54.160> output<00:05:54.370> and

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
the decrease in the amount of output and

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.980 
the decrease in the amount of output and
I<00:05:55.150> clean<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.480> a<00:05:55.780> lot<00:05:56.470> more<00:05:57.330> regularly<00:05:58.330> now<00:05:58.600> like

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
I clean it a lot more regularly now like

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.110 
I clean it a lot more regularly now like
a<00:05:59.200> lot<00:05:59.470> like<00:05:59.740> I<00:05:59.860> clean<00:06:00.100> about<00:06:00.340> every<00:06:00.640> month<00:06:00.850> and

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
a lot like I clean about every month and

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.090 
a lot like I clean about every month and
I<00:06:01.570> clean<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.900> aquarium<00:06:02.020> every<00:06:02.470> two<00:06:02.620> weeks<00:06:02.830> so

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
I clean the aquarium every two weeks so

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.870 
I clean the aquarium every two weeks so
it's<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.270> fluval<00:06:04.780> 305<00:06:05.620> filter<00:06:06.100> and<00:06:06.340> I've<00:06:06.790> been

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
it's the fluval 305 filter and I've been

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.280 
it's the fluval 305 filter and I've been
really<00:06:07.150> disappointed<00:06:07.330> with<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.930> way<00:06:07.960> that

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
really disappointed with the way that

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.170 
really disappointed with the way that
the<00:06:08.470> output<00:06:08.620> has<00:06:08.950> decreased<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:09.640> I'm<00:06:09.790> thinking

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
the output has decreased so I'm thinking

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.570 
the output has decreased so I'm thinking
about<00:06:10.450> maybe<00:06:11.200> getting<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.650> different<00:06:11.860> brand<00:06:12.370> of

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
about maybe getting a different brand of

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.950 
about maybe getting a different brand of
filter<00:06:12.880> but<00:06:13.180> I'm<00:06:13.300> not<00:06:13.480> really<00:06:13.570> sure<00:06:13.720> about

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
filter but I'm not really sure about

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.680 
filter but I'm not really sure about
that<00:06:14.170> and<00:06:14.610> definitely<00:06:15.610> first<00:06:16.150> off<00:06:16.330> before<00:06:16.660> I

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
that and definitely first off before I

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.050 
that and definitely first off before I
do<00:06:16.780> that<00:06:16.870> I'm<00:06:17.110> going<00:06:17.230> to<00:06:17.290> reorder<00:06:17.710> an<00:06:18.700> impeller

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
do that I'm going to reorder an impeller

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.640 
do that I'm going to reorder an impeller
because<00:06:19.510> I've<00:06:19.660> noticed<00:06:20.260> that<00:06:20.290> it's<00:06:20.470> gone<00:06:20.590> a

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
because I've noticed that it's gone a

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.070 
because I've noticed that it's gone a
lot<00:06:20.890> weaker<00:06:21.130> over<00:06:21.310> time<00:06:21.550> and<00:06:21.910> I<00:06:22.600> think<00:06:22.660> that

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
lot weaker over time and I think that

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.330 
lot weaker over time and I think that
maybe<00:06:23.230> that<00:06:23.500> might<00:06:23.710> have<00:06:23.890> been<00:06:23.920> the<00:06:24.040> cause<00:06:24.310> of

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
maybe that might have been the cause of

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.460 
maybe that might have been the cause of
it<00:06:24.670> so<00:06:25.240> I'm<00:06:25.390> thinking<00:06:25.720> by<00:06:25.930> getting<00:06:26.260> a<00:06:26.350> new

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
it so I'm thinking by getting a new

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.800 
it so I'm thinking by getting a new
impeller<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:27.100> can<00:06:27.310> up<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.700> output<00:06:28.600> again

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
impeller I can up the output again

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.320 
impeller I can up the output again
without<00:06:29.050> having<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.620> expend<00:06:30.040> a<00:06:30.880> lot<00:06:30.940> of<00:06:31.300> money

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
without having to expend a lot of money

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.540 
without having to expend a lot of money
getting<00:06:32.050> a<00:06:32.230> new<00:06:32.350> filter<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:33.280> I'll<00:06:33.400> definitely

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
getting a new filter so I'll definitely

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.700 
getting a new filter so I'll definitely
look<00:06:33.820> into<00:06:33.940> that<00:06:34.150> first<00:06:34.450> so<00:06:34.840> probably<00:06:35.500> show

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
look into that first so probably show

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.220 
look into that first so probably show
you<00:06:35.800> guys<00:06:35.890> a<00:06:35.950> video<00:06:36.190> about<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:36.640> as<00:06:36.790> well

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
you guys a video about that as well

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.279 
you guys a video about that as well
coming

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
coming

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.010 
coming
soon<00:06:38.529> and<00:06:38.740> then<00:06:39.399> you<00:06:39.939> know<00:06:40.029> also<00:06:40.240> just<00:06:40.779> the<00:06:40.899> air

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
soon and then you know also just the air

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.109 
soon and then you know also just the air
pump<00:06:41.259> is<00:06:41.529> not<00:06:41.830> pumping<00:06:42.009> as<00:06:42.249> much<00:06:42.430> air<00:06:42.789> anymore

00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:43.119 
pump is not pumping as much air anymore

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.760 
pump is not pumping as much air anymore
I<00:06:43.479> think<00:06:43.960> these<00:06:44.020> are<00:06:44.080> all<00:06:44.289> just<00:06:44.319> things<00:06:44.680> that

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
I think these are all just things that

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.469 
I think these are all just things that
happen<00:06:45.189> as<00:06:45.399> your<00:06:45.610> aquarium<00:06:45.849> gets<00:06:46.149> older<00:06:46.449> and

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
happen as your aquarium gets older and

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.059 
happen as your aquarium gets older and
you<00:06:46.930> know<00:06:47.020> costly<00:06:47.499> you're<00:06:47.680> going<00:06:47.800> to<00:06:47.860> end<00:06:47.979> up

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
you know costly you're going to end up

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:50.129 
you know costly you're going to end up
having<00:06:48.399> the<00:06:48.550> new<00:06:49.539> things<00:06:49.779> you're<00:06:49.930> going<00:06:50.050> to

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
having the new things you're going to

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.450 
having the new things you're going to
end<00:06:50.259> up<00:06:50.319> having<00:06:50.619> to<00:06:50.710> buy<00:06:50.860> and<00:06:51.069> everything<00:06:51.369> that

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
end up having to buy and everything that

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.920 
end up having to buy and everything that
you<00:06:51.580> don't<00:06:51.759> really<00:06:51.909> realize<00:06:52.180> the<00:06:52.599> first<00:06:52.779> time

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
you don't really realize the first time

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:10.839 
and I guess one other thing you guys

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.989 
and I guess one other thing you guys
might<00:07:11.020> not<00:07:11.139> know<00:07:11.349> is<00:07:11.499> that<00:07:11.529> my<00:07:11.889> mystery<00:07:12.729> snail

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:12.999 
might not know is that my mystery snail

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.989 
might not know is that my mystery snail
my<00:07:13.659> apple<00:07:13.959> snail<00:07:14.169> died<00:07:14.469> passed<00:07:15.009> away<00:07:15.279> I<00:07:15.490> think

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:15.999 
my apple snail died passed away I think

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.459 
my apple snail died passed away I think
it<00:07:16.209> was<00:07:16.330> getting<00:07:16.629> really<00:07:16.779> old<00:07:16.899> though<00:07:17.229> because

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:17.469 
it was getting really old though because

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:20.579 
it was getting really old though because
I've<00:07:17.830> had<00:07:17.860> that<00:07:18.219> for<00:07:18.490> two<00:07:18.699> years<00:07:19.199> so<00:07:20.199> yeah<00:07:20.349> I

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:20.589 
I've had that for two years so yeah I

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.519 
I've had that for two years so yeah I
think<00:07:21.539> it<00:07:22.539> must<00:07:22.779> have<00:07:22.959> just<00:07:22.990> gotten<00:07:23.289> really

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
think it must have just gotten really

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.739 
think it must have just gotten really
old<00:07:23.619> and<00:07:24.039> then<00:07:24.309> uh<00:07:24.339> I<00:07:24.759> just<00:07:25.029> it<00:07:25.419> just<00:07:25.629> passed

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:25.749 
old and then uh I just it just passed

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:28.199 
old and then uh I just it just passed
away<00:07:25.990> so<00:07:26.110> and<00:07:26.860> I<00:07:27.430> got<00:07:27.580> it<00:07:27.729> when<00:07:27.789> it<00:07:27.909> was<00:07:27.939> pretty

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:28.209

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:30.809 
away so and I got it when it was pretty
big<00:07:28.389> so<00:07:28.659> who<00:07:28.809> knows<00:07:28.959> how<00:07:29.139> old<00:07:29.289> it<00:07:29.439> was<00:07:29.639> but<00:07:30.639> so
