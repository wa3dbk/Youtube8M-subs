00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
steel which is going to allow them to

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.360 
steel which is going to allow them to
truly<00:04:04.420> laugh<00:04:04.780> for<00:04:05.140> an<00:04:05.230> entire<00:04:05.500> lifetime<00:04:05.769> yeah

now<00:04:08.170> secondly<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.920> shape<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.700> know

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
now secondly the shape of it you know

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.880 
now secondly the shape of it you know
you<00:04:09.849> never<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.239> what<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:10.780> shape<00:04:11.019> is<00:04:11.349> of<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
you never see what the shape is of the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.440 
you never see what the shape is of the
outside<00:04:12.310> because<00:04:12.579> it's<00:04:12.760> buried<00:04:13.239> in<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
outside because it's buried in the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.809 
outside because it's buried in the
ground<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.959> see<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.349> overhang<00:04:15.069> here<00:04:15.099> what

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
ground but I see this overhang here what

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.210 
ground but I see this overhang here what
is<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.060> purpose<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:17.500> get<00:04:17.680> two

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
is the purpose of that we get two

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.759 
is the purpose of that we get two
benefits<00:04:18.400> out<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.900> been<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.650> way

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
benefits out of that that been the way

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.230 
benefits out of that that been the way
that<00:04:20.799> these<00:04:21.099> things<00:04:21.489> are<00:04:21.700> formed<00:04:22.030> on<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
that these things are formed on the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.820 
that these things are formed on the
outside<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.750> makes<00:04:22.930> them<00:04:23.050> very<00:04:23.289> structurally

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
outside it makes them very structurally

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.469 
outside it makes them very structurally
sound<00:04:24.070> which<00:04:24.340> allows<00:04:24.610> us<00:04:24.789> to<00:04:24.940> not<00:04:25.090> put<00:04:25.360> any

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
sound which allows us to not put any

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.240 
sound which allows us to not put any
cross<00:04:25.780> sections<00:04:26.260> on<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.500> inside<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.099> you're

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
cross sections on the inside so you're

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.710 
cross sections on the inside so you're
not<00:04:27.340> tripping<00:04:27.760> over<00:04:27.849> them<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.120> most<00:04:28.389> pits

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
not tripping over them like most pits

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.810 
not tripping over them like most pits
are<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.139> are<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.590> length<00:04:29.830> right<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:30.580> it

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
are that are of this length right but it

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.760 
are that are of this length right but it
also<00:04:31.060> doubles<00:04:31.450> there's<00:04:31.840> very<00:04:32.080> nice<00:04:32.260> shelves

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
also doubles there's very nice shelves

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.469 
also doubles there's very nice shelves
