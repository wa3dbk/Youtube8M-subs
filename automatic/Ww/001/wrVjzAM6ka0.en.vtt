00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello all again a few 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.920
 asks how i get 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.370
 power supplies do not farm two power supplies 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 750 watts they are the same but on the plane 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.320
 no matter the same they are not the same 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.320
 here's the bottom farm 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.380
 and work this sands 720 and points 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.660
 used until very recently 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.360
 no matter what denomination you have 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.100
 power is 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.420
 the leading god is my adder 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.420
 from it comes power 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.240
 yes motherboard 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 so here is better to show 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.980
 motherboard here 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.920
 and on one video each suburb on 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.700
 answered the card then in the case of the second unit 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.960
 slave here is the top block 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.370
 from him it means spending on cable 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.620
 motherboard closed green black 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.620
 it's like power button emulation 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.260
 the rest go to video two video cards and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.260
 on the ventilation system 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.200
 accordingly the process of inclusion 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.149
 next time should be run 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:33.130
 at first 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.130
 top led year fought 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.450
 then turn on 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.450
 last year 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 which is already trying to reach for 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.110
 contacts 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.770
 instead it's just a bus from a student 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.640
 a life 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.640
 he called download 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 Well, you have a button 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.450
 fine 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.479
 what they say that blocks and different what 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.649
 burns all these roudyk he's short 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.649
 the closure will not be here 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.650
 well, 0 and then again constant voltage 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.650
 no distortions connected 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.819
 down to the voltage there the whole process 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 driver 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.330
 and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 more power 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.600
 groundwork essentially on 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
 Are the chords exactly the same? 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.680
 who 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.040
 the voltage limit will not have been 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 equally and farther God gives your 12 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.250
 volt to the card without a difference that is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.710
 no need to film blocks 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.630
 sufficient them 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.110
 connect here on a relationship 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.110
 you see 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.390
 nothing burn everything works great 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 no shifts nothing i am myths 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.040
 which eliminates two months already 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.709
 theme works 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.750
 everything is fine here from the ice block 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.210
 powered by two video cards and systems 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.710
 ventilation 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.710
 nothing more new connect 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.710
 if you still have questions of course 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.820
 ask but I will help so much 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.820
 obvious just 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.100
 problems should not be such blocks 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.760
 you can connect with a dozen of each 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.220
 video each card 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.120
 your desires are no more secrets 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.510
 put 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.470
 contact abdullah 7 here 70. 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.470
 hot cards 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.870
 I have enough cooling now 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.870
 26 degrees heat 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.800
 this farm heats up just already like 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.910
 these are 60 degrees 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.910
 VAT to 80 comes very hot 730 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.100
 very hot stick lorna cards 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.690
 separate rendered 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.989
 execute it 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.989
 calves 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.289
 additional

 sweeties 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.770
 zafira taxi is the most powerful card 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.700
 608 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.870
 I think 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.060
 all these faces are beautiful too 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.060
 learning 57 degrees boxing 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.949
 room temperature park 627 temple 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.529
 the weakest gigabytes here only 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.629
 you are expected 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.729
 but assignments are cold sites and doctors 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.330
 ever spent 60 degrees somewhere 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.280
 , 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.880
 still powerful enough this middle 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.490
 there is just a map 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.660
 great too 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:17.730
 driving cold card 70 degrees 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:21.370
 maximum at 740 and 756 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.590
 fell color on and all speak very much 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.480
 hot card 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.480
 somewhere 745 dasha gives 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.830
 on hot 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.750
 ecco boots are very hot too 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.330
 as 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.520
 I do not advise 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.889
 that is, for the smallest the most usually the most 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:49.069
 good gigabyte 280 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:49.069
 asus 283 you are a grass consumer sapphire too 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.870
 if you have questions ask with joy 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.870
