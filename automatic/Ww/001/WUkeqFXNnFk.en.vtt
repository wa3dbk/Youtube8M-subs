this<00:00:11.730> mid<00:00:11.910> lane<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.420> lot<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.870> pressure<00:00:13.049> now

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
this mid lane here a lot of pressure now

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.690 
this mid lane here a lot of pressure now
for<00:00:13.410> melange<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.010> interesting<00:00:14.370> push<00:00:14.519> off

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
for melange to just interesting push off

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.670 
for melange to just interesting push off
the<00:00:14.730> wave<00:00:15.000> Yankers<00:00:15.780> coming<00:00:16.080> behind<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the wave Yankers coming behind so is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.410 
the wave Yankers coming behind so is
nommy<00:00:16.890> yeah<00:00:17.310> clever<00:00:17.640> use<00:00:17.849> of<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.119> pressure

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
nommy yeah clever use of that pressure

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.670 
nommy yeah clever use of that pressure
because<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> course<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.200> were<00:00:19.320> starting<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
because of course they were starting to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.080 
because of course they were starting to
put<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.040> pressure<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.400> bottom<00:00:20.880> tower

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
put that pressure on that bottom tower

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150 
put that pressure on that bottom tower
alliance<00:00:21.480> immediately<00:00:22.169> counteracting<00:00:23.040> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
alliance immediately counteracting it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.100 
alliance immediately counteracting it
putting<00:00:23.340> pressure<00:00:23.580> somewhere<00:00:24.060> else<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.900> could

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
putting pressure somewhere else we could

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.470 
putting pressure somewhere else we could
take<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.619> low<00:00:25.860> and<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.430> why<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.270> had<00:00:27.450> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
take in low and that was why they had to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
take in low and that was why they had to
pull<00:00:27.779> force<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.380> pressure<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.829> that<00:00:28.860> mid

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
pull force that pressure in that mid

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
pull force that pressure in that mid
lane<00:00:29.309> had<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:29.849> take<00:00:30.029> them<00:00:30.149> away<00:00:30.419> but<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> can
