double-clutching<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.170> procedure<00:02:12.740> that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
double-clutching is a procedure that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.520 
double-clutching is a procedure that
allows<00:02:13.160> engine<00:02:13.940> speed<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.330> driveline<00:02:15.140> speed

allows engine speed and driveline speed

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.949 
allows engine speed and driveline speed
