function it at a more optimal level so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
function it at a more optimal level so
that's<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.149> other

thing that people notice on an immediate
basis<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> increased<00:01:00.239> energy<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:01.230> also

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
basis is increased energy they also

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.180 
basis is increased energy they also
notice<00:01:02.180> clarity<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> mind<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.960> their<00:01:04.770> ability
