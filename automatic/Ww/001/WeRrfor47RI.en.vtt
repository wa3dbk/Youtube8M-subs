nice try to get so you have first are

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.749 
nice try to get so you have first are
you<00:00:02.700> recording<00:00:03.000> yes<00:00:03.480> okay<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.310> this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.520> this

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
you recording yes okay so this is this

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.880 
you recording yes okay so this is this
is<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> permanent<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.109> we're<00:00:07.259> making<00:00:07.379> in

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
is a permanent not that we're making in

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.330 
is a permanent not that we're making in
the<00:00:08.040> line<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.610> order<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.420> make<00:00:10.139> anchors<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the line in order to make anchors and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
the line in order to make anchors and
it's<00:00:11.550> called<00:00:11.759> an<00:00:11.940> overhand<00:00:12.360> knot<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:12.870> really

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
it's called an overhand knot it's really

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.530 
it's called an overhand knot it's really
simple<00:00:13.440> okay<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.940> I'm<00:00:15.150> doing<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.420> I'm

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
simple okay so all I'm doing is I'm

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.040 
simple okay so all I'm doing is I'm
making<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.020> loop<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.560> gotta<00:00:17.660> make<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
making a loop here gotta make kind of a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.130 
making a loop here gotta make kind of a
bigger<00:00:19.320> loop<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:21.570> better<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
bigger loop it's better if you have a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
bigger loop it's better if you have a
bigger<00:00:22.380> loop<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:22.949> easier<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.789> deal

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
bigger loop it's just easier to deal

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.770 
bigger loop it's just easier to deal
with<00:00:25.580> that

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.560 

and<00:00:28.990> then<00:00:29.410> I'm<00:00:29.560> just<00:00:29.910> folding<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.000> over

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.080 

drive<00:00:36.350> back<00:00:36.650> up<00:00:36.680> through<00:00:37.070> setting<00:00:37.880> over

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
drive back up through setting over

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.190 
drive back up through setting over
handler<00:00:38.390> her<00:00:39.140> car<00:00:39.350> actually

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
handler her car actually

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.050 
handler her car actually
make<00:00:41.440> this

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.210 

a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.660> bigger

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.830 

will<00:00:50.310> help<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.790> up<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> slack

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
will help take up a lot of the slack

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.780 
will help take up a lot of the slack
you<00:00:54.020> have<00:00:54.170> such<00:00:54.380> a<00:00:54.410> long

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
you have such a long

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.140 
you have such a long
the<00:00:56.210> ink<00:00:56.420> i'm<00:00:56.720> sorry

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.080 

see<00:01:04.720> okay<00:01:05.350> now<00:01:06.070> basically<00:01:06.400> all<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.820> does<00:01:07.060> is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
see okay now basically all this does is

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.000 
see okay now basically all this does is
it<00:01:07.270> makes<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.630> wheeler<00:01:07.900> not<00:01:08.170> going<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.410> move<00:01:08.500> got

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
it makes a wheeler not going to move got

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.160 
it makes a wheeler not going to move got
it<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.580> it'll<00:01:09.970> tighten<00:01:10.240> itself<00:01:10.630> by<00:01:10.840> going

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
it and it'll tighten itself by going

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.910 
it and it'll tighten itself by going
right<00:01:11.980> as<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.610> pull<00:01:12.880> on<00:01:12.910> it<00:01:13.150> it'll<00:01:13.510> eventually

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
right as you pull on it it'll eventually

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.430 
right as you pull on it it'll eventually
use<00:01:14.920> into<00:01:15.340> its<00:01:15.490> own<00:01:15.670> which<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.570> good<00:01:16.600> no

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
use into its own which is not good no

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.010 
use into its own which is not good no
which<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.890> good<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.400> is<00:01:18.460> good<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.970> its<00:01:19.720> for<00:01:19.960> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
which is good it is good for its for a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.540 
which is good it is good for its for a
permanent<00:01:20.410> not<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.860> doesn't<00:01:21.010> matter<00:01:21.280> if<00:01:21.460> it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
permanent not it doesn't matter if it

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:32.370 
permanent not it doesn't matter if it
uses<00:01:21.790> fine<00:01:22.450> if<00:01:22.600> occur

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200 

second<00:01:33.130> loop

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
second loop

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.070 
second loop
probably<00:01:34.750> about<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.740> same<00:01:36.010> length

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
probably about the same length

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.750 
probably about the same length
yeah<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.800> doesn't<00:01:38.950> have<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.220> be<00:01:39.250> perfect

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
yeah it doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.420 
yeah it doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:40.270> know<00:01:40.360> oh<00:01:40.650> yeah

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.280 

so<00:01:46.030> this<00:01:46.240> looks<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:46.540> something<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.050> you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
so this looks like something you can you

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.590 
so this looks like something you can you
only<00:01:47.410> need<00:01:47.620> to<00:01:47.650> maybe<00:01:47.830> make<00:01:48.250> once<00:01:48.610> yes<00:01:49.150> these

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
only need to maybe make once yes these

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.710 
only need to maybe make once yes these
are<00:01:49.660> permanent<00:01:50.440> oh<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.790> do<00:01:51.940> them<00:01:52.120> once<00:01:52.360> this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
are permanent oh you do them once this

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.740 
are permanent oh you do them once this
is<00:01:52.900> just<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.460> initially<00:01:54.460> set<00:01:54.700> up<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.940> lawn<00:01:55.120> got

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
is just to initially set up the lawn got

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960 
is just to initially set up the lawn got
it<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.860> might<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.400> do<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.550> if<00:01:57.730> you<00:01:57.820> get

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
it you might have to do it if you get

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.990 
it you might have to do it if you get
new<00:01:58.150> anchor<00:01:58.360> or<00:01:59.020> put<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.740> that's<00:02:00.190> your<00:02:00.370> sex<00:02:00.670> 1

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
new anchor or put it that's your sex 1

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.510 
new anchor or put it that's your sex 1
inc<00:02:01.180> ok<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.320> then<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.680> wraps<00:02:02.890> around<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.250> tree

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
inc ok and then it wraps around the tree

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.320 
inc ok and then it wraps around the tree
I<00:02:05.220> mean<00:02:06.220> look<00:02:06.430> how<00:02:06.550> much<00:02:06.700> you've<00:02:06.940> got<00:02:07.180> like

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
I mean look how much you've got like

I mean look how much you've got like
five<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:10.390> have<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.630> wrap<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.929> around<00:02:11.670> numerous

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
five you have to wrap it around numerous

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.740 
five you have to wrap it around numerous
times<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.550> see<00:02:18.730> where<00:02:18.970> you'd<00:02:19.239> want<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.570> have
