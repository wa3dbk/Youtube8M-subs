00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.710 
everyone right in the face these moon
landings<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:32.220> happens<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:33.480> anyone

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
landings actually happens can anyone

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.800 
landings actually happens can anyone
explain<00:02:34.260> how<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.670> every<00:02:36.030> shot<00:02:36.569> of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
explain how it is that in every shot of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.740 
explain how it is that in every shot of
these<00:02:37.019> astronauts<00:02:37.560> moving<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> moon

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
these astronauts moving on the moon

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.690 
these astronauts moving on the moon
every<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> dust<00:02:40.349> stirred<00:02:40.799> up<00:02:41.040> by<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
every bit of dust stirred up by them and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.030 
every bit of dust stirred up by them and
their<00:02:41.849> vehicles<00:02:42.420> immediately<00:02:42.989> falls<00:02:43.620> back<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
their vehicles immediately falls back to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.640 
their vehicles immediately falls back to
the<00:02:44.099> surface<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:46.049> say<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the surface just like it would say on a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.360 
the surface just like it would say on a
beach<00:02:47.599> this<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.780> fine<00:02:49.140> dust<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.130> weightless

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
beach this is fine dust in a weightless

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.509 
beach this is fine dust in a weightless
environment<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:52.470> defies<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.069> laws<00:02:53.489> of

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
environment this defies the laws of

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.630 
environment this defies the laws of
physics<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.450> ask<00:02:57.599> yourself<00:02:58.109> if<00:02:58.350> they'll<00:02:59.340> fake

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
physics so ask yourself if they'll fake

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.040 
physics so ask yourself if they'll fake
that<00:03:00.500> what<00:03:01.500> won't<00:03:01.739> they<00:03:01.890> do
