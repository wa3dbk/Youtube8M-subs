00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.170 

ok<00:00:02.469> lesson<00:00:02.710> 2<00:00:03.040> I<00:00:03.070> want<00:00:03.310> to<00:00:03.490> take<00:00:03.699> this<00:00:03.729> concept

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
ok lesson 2 I want to take this concept

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.710 
ok lesson 2 I want to take this concept
into<00:00:04.660> another<00:00:05.670> position<00:00:06.670> and<00:00:06.849> another<00:00:07.359> scale

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
into another position and another scale

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.130 
into another position and another scale
pattern<00:00:08.170> and<00:00:08.349> another<00:00:08.620> chord<00:00:09.010> shape<00:00:09.340> ok<00:00:09.850> and

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.140 
pattern and another chord shape ok and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.170 
pattern and another chord shape ok and
I've<00:00:11.140> chosen<00:00:11.680> these<00:00:12.190> couple<00:00:12.640> of<00:00:12.700> chord<00:00:12.970> shapes

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
I've chosen these couple of chord shapes

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.540 
I've chosen these couple of chord shapes
because<00:00:13.330> they're<00:00:13.780> they're<00:00:14.320> very<00:00:14.950> common<00:00:15.400> and

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:15.550 
because they're they're very common and

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.410 
because they're they're very common and
yet<00:00:15.700> sometimes<00:00:15.940> they're<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.269> little

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
yet sometimes they're a little

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.480 
yet sometimes they're a little
overlooked<00:00:16.960> by<00:00:17.230> some<00:00:17.470> people<00:00:17.859> especially

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
overlooked by some people especially

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.679 
overlooked by some people especially
playing<00:00:18.849> in<00:00:19.060> a<00:00:19.119> major<00:00:19.919> scale<00:00:20.919> pattern<00:00:20.949> so<00:00:21.909> here

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
playing in a major scale pattern so here

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.870 
playing in a major scale pattern so here
we<00:00:22.839> are<00:00:22.989> I'm<00:00:23.349> going<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.800> come<00:00:24.009> up<00:00:24.159> here<00:00:24.189> way<00:00:24.699> up

here<00:00:27.069> is<00:00:27.189> C<00:00:27.789> shape<00:00:28.239> a<00:00:28.509> chord<00:00:29.199> it's<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.099> c-shape

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
here is C shape a chord it's a c-shape

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.000 
here is C shape a chord it's a c-shape
as<00:00:31.149> if<00:00:31.449> i<00:00:31.569> was<00:00:31.689> playing<00:00:31.899> this<00:00:32.020> basically<00:00:32.680> see

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
but once again I want to be thinking

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.520 
but once again I want to be thinking
about<00:00:54.129> this<00:00:54.489> shape<00:00:54.820> as<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.120> relates<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
about this shape as it relates to the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.009 
about this shape as it relates to the
underlying<00:00:56.920> scale<00:00:57.609> pattern<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.300> again<00:00:58.839> I'm

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
underlying scale pattern and again I'm

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.410 
underlying scale pattern and again I'm
thinking<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.499> an<00:00:59.589> a<00:00:59.859> major<00:01:00.219> pentatonic<00:01:00.820> just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
thinking of an a major pentatonic just

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.910 
thinking of an a major pentatonic just
as<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:01.570> basic<00:01:01.989> pattern<00:01:02.289> I'm<00:01:02.559> you're<00:01:02.679> not<00:01:02.800> gonna

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
as a basic pattern I'm you're not gonna

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920 
as a basic pattern I'm you're not gonna
be<00:01:03.039> thinking<00:01:03.280> about<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.730> Navy<00:01:03.940> major

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
be thinking about the Navy major

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.140 
be thinking about the Navy major
diatonic<00:01:05.530> doesn't<00:01:06.040> really<00:01:06.160> matter<00:01:06.430> I'm<00:01:06.970> just

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
diatonic doesn't really matter I'm just

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.430 
diatonic doesn't really matter I'm just
just<00:01:07.900> using<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.500> pentatonic<00:01:09.220> as<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:10.540> teaching

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
just using the pentatonic as a teaching

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.490 
just using the pentatonic as a teaching
method<00:01:11.590> here<00:01:11.950> ok<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.510> case<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.140> C

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
method here ok so in this case this C

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.010 
method here ok so in this case this C
shape<00:01:14.890> fits<00:01:15.400> over<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.820> top<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.570> our<00:01:17.760> fourth

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
shape fits over the top of our fourth

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.650 
shape fits over the top of our fourth
pentatonic<00:01:20.020> shape<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.560> I'm<00:01:21.370> using<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.600> a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
pentatonic shape and I'm using it as a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.750 
pentatonic shape and I'm using it as a
major<00:01:23.050> here<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.650> I'm<00:01:23.710> starting<00:01:24.160> here<00:01:24.430> with<00:01:24.460> my

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
major here so I'm starting here with my

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.750 
major here so I'm starting here with my
room<00:01:25.000> them<00:01:25.240> ok<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.740> want<00:01:26.980> you<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.280> get<00:01:27.490> used

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
room them ok and I want you to get used

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.880 
room them ok and I want you to get used
to<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.300> riffs<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.990> find<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.710> this

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
to the riffs that you find in this

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.310 
to the riffs that you find in this
pattern<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:31.000> again<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> want<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.050> keep

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
pattern but again I want you to keep

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.790 
pattern but again I want you to keep
thinking<00:01:32.830> about<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.100> caged<00:01:33.730> chord<00:01:34.660> shape<00:01:35.110> ok

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
thinking about that caged chord shape ok

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.710 
thinking about that caged chord shape ok
you<00:01:36.430> want<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.730> keep<00:01:36.850> coming<00:01:37.210> back<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.390> those

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
you want to keep coming back to those

00:01:37.720 --> 00:02:01.820 
you want to keep coming back to those
porto

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.320 

went<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.890> little<00:02:03.009> diatonic<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.850> but<00:02:04.119> you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
went a little diatonic there but you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.020 
went a little diatonic there but you
know<00:02:04.360> I'm<00:02:04.570> still<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.560> shape<00:02:06.070> or<00:02:06.340> I'm<00:02:06.549> in

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
know I'm still in that a shape or I'm in

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.639 
know I'm still in that a shape or I'm in
that<00:02:07.180> C<00:02:07.450> shape<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.869> playing<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> major

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
that C shape of playing the a major

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.610 
that C shape of playing the a major
chord<00:02:08.860> okay<00:02:09.580> now<00:02:10.030> let's<00:02:10.060> bring<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.690> down<00:02:10.929> to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
chord okay now let's bring it down to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.220 
chord okay now let's bring it down to
where<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.980> would<00:02:12.220> fall<00:02:12.489> over<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:13.150> D<00:02:13.390> chord<00:02:13.750> so

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
where this would fall over a D chord so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.890 
where this would fall over a D chord so
basically<00:02:14.590> if<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.489> my<00:02:15.640> root<00:02:16.000> note<00:02:16.269> for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
basically if this is my root note for

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.680 
basically if this is my root note for
the<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.019> for<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.830> C<00:02:18.190> shaped<00:02:18.459> chord<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:18.970> an<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.360> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the a for this C shaped chord as an a I
