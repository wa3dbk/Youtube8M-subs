00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
thia of how this works basically there's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.150 
thia of how this works basically there's
these<00:02:11.550> slots<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> slits<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.050> these<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.830> here

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
these slots and slits in these in here

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.030 
these slots and slits in these in here
where<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.490> put<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> kicks<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.080> now

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
where you put one of the kicks in now

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.860 
where you put one of the kicks in now
the<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.700> thickness<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.560> width<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.040> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the the thickness of this width here is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.990 
the the thickness of this width here is
thick<00:02:21.870> wide<00:02:22.500> enough<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> hold<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.459> deck<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
thick wide enough to hold a deck that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.020 
thick wide enough to hold a deck that
either<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:24.720> grip<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.440> no<00:02:25.980> grip<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:26.910> going

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
to show you three decks with no grip

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.309 
to show you three decks with no grip
just<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> give<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.850> an<00:02:29.970> idea<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.600> what<00:02:31.200> it

of session a lot of you have probably
already<00:03:14.489> thought<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.209> by<00:03:15.329> looking

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
already thought of this just by looking

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.410 
already thought of this just by looking
at<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.530> does<00:03:16.829> make<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> great<00:03:17.549> rack<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.390> your

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
at it it does make a great rack for your

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.460 
at it it does make a great rack for your
finger<00:03:18.780> boards<00:03:19.170> but<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.040> also<00:03:20.220> makes<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:21.000> great

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
finger boards but it also makes a great

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.780 
finger boards but it also makes a great
obstacle<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.680> mean<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.250> right<00:03:23.459> here<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.760> like

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
obstacle I mean this right here is like

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.620 
obstacle I mean this right here is like
a<00:03:23.940> little<00:03:24.150> mini<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.780> little<00:03:25.650> mini<00:03:25.799> two-step<00:03:26.630> and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
a little mini a little mini two-step and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.509 
a little mini a little mini two-step and
then<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.829> one<00:03:29.070> which<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
then you have this one which is just a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.940 
then you have this one which is just a
little<00:03:29.730> bigger<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.870> got<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.200> three

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
little bigger and you got like a three

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.800 
little bigger and you got like a three
Lynch<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.790> if<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.450> want<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.720> get

Lynch now if you really want to get

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.690 
Lynch now if you really want to get
creative<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.680> don't<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.070> Roswell's

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
creative and I don't know if Roswell's

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.020 
creative and I don't know if Roswell's
was<00:03:35.970> going<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.170> how<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:38.030> use

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
was going for this but this is how I use

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.060 
was going for this but this is how I use
my<00:03:39.060> creativity<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.140> imagination<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.739> come<00:03:40.980> up

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
my creativity and imagination to come up

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.550 
my creativity and imagination to come up
with<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:42.150> get<00:03:42.480> all<00:03:42.690> three<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.380> these

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
with this if you get all three of these

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.140 
with this if you get all three of these
you<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.519> actually<00:03:45.170> lock<00:03:46.170> them<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.150> have

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
you can actually lock them up and have

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.690 
guys here now I got to hold it together
but<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:58.829> it's<00:03:58.980> set<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.549> and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
but when it's set up like this and

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550 
but when it's set up like this and
you're<00:03:59.790> writing<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.090> session<00:04:00.570> it's<00:04:01.019> no<00:04:01.290> problem

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
you're writing a session it's no problem

you're writing a session it's no problem
it<00:04:01.799> doesn't<00:04:02.040> fall<00:04:02.190> apart<00:04:02.519> but<00:04:03.299> there<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.600> go

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
it doesn't fall apart but there you go

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.920 
it doesn't fall apart but there you go
so<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.049> can<00:04:04.200> see<00:04:04.320> like<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.590> multi<00:04:04.950> levels<00:04:05.310> a

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
so you can see like the multi levels a

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.509 
so you can see like the multi levels a
higher<00:04:06.930> level<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:07.530> coming<00:04:07.920> down<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> lower

higher level here coming down to a lower

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.520 
higher level here coming down to a lower
level<00:04:08.640> then<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> kick<00:04:09.570> off<00:04:09.780> or<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.500> can

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
kickflip nose manual and then you got

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.479 
kickflip nose manual and then you got
like<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> nice<00:04:15.209> little<00:04:15.600> high<00:04:16.320> ledge<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.190> go
