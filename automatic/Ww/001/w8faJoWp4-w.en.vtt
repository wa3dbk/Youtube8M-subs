much al I'd like to tell you about our

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.060 
much al I'd like to tell you about our
newest<00:00:22.300> product<00:00:22.650> we've<00:00:23.650> got<00:00:23.859> this<00:00:24.010> thing

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
newest product we've got this thing

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.849 
newest product we've got this thing
called<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.640> session<00:00:24.910> di<00:00:25.270> and<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.289> purpose<00:00:26.710> of

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
called a session di and the purpose of

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.630 
called a session di and the purpose of
this<00:00:27.070> is<00:00:27.520> to<00:00:27.580> allow<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.539> working<00:00:29.410> musician<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
this is to allow a working musician to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.619 
this is to allow a working musician to
get<00:00:30.850> that<00:00:31.119> finished<00:00:31.500> mastered<00:00:32.500> studio<00:00:32.980> sound

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
get that finished mastered studio sound

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.430 
get that finished mastered studio sound
live<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.040> were<00:00:36.190> doing<00:00:36.400> our<00:00:36.640> videos<00:00:37.030> we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
live when we were doing our videos we

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910 
live when we were doing our videos we
learned<00:00:38.440> from<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.820> end<00:00:40.449> result<00:00:40.930> was<00:00:41.500> actually

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
learned from the end result was actually

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.310 
learned from the end result was actually
better<00:00:42.159> than<00:00:42.400> what<00:00:42.580> we<00:00:42.699> tracked<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:44.110> like

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
better than what we tracked and so like

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.610 
better than what we tracked and so like
this<00:00:44.860> allows<00:00:45.250> you<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.940> like<00:00:46.659> they<00:00:47.049> do<00:00:47.110> stuff<00:00:47.470> in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
this allows you to like they do stuff in

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.110 
this allows you to like they do stuff in
the<00:00:47.710> studio<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.190> your<00:00:48.370> signal<00:00:48.909> that's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
the studio to your signal that's

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.170 
the studio to your signal that's
analogous<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.989> Photoshop<00:00:50.769> for<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> photo<00:00:51.370> so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
analogous to Photoshop for a photo so

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.210 
analogous to Photoshop for a photo so
they<00:00:52.360> mess<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:52.839> they<00:00:53.199> really<00:00:53.500> mess<00:00:53.769> with<00:00:53.799> it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
they mess with they really mess with it

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.910 
they mess with they really mess with it
but<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:54.909> don't<00:00:55.030> hear<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.510> they're<00:00:55.659> so<00:00:55.839> good<00:00:56.080> so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
but you don't hear it they're so good so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.759 
but you don't hear it they're so good so
we've<00:00:57.369> learned<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.119> two<00:00:58.330> major<00:00:58.570> tools<00:00:59.019> that

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
we've learned the two major tools that

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.500 
we've learned the two major tools that
these<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.190> most<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.729> mixing<00:01:01.089> engineers

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
these that most of the mixing engineers

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.439 
these that most of the mixing engineers
use<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.110> studio<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.799> we<00:01:03.309> leverage<00:01:03.850> this<00:01:04.119> and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
use in a studio and we leverage this and

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.130 
use in a studio and we leverage this and
put<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.629> into<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.930> DI<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> gigging<00:01:07.090> musician

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
put it into a DI so a gigging musician

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.230 
put it into a DI so a gigging musician
and<00:01:08.140> go<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.530> gig<00:01:08.859> and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
and go to a gig and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.320 
and go to a gig and
in<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.540> way<00:01:10.840> like<00:01:11.320> have<00:01:11.620> a<00:01:11.650> professional<00:01:12.610> mixing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
in a way like have a professional mixing

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.310 
in a way like have a professional mixing
musician<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.619> be<00:01:14.799> his<00:01:15.100> front<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.520> house<00:01:15.729> guide

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
musician to be his front of house guide

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.290 
musician to be his front of house guide
so<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.500> two<00:01:17.680> specific<00:01:17.950> tools<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.909> we<00:01:19.030> found

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
so the two specific tools that we found

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.920 
so the two specific tools that we found
is<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:21.040> call<00:01:21.220> saturation<00:01:22.060> which<00:01:22.750> is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
is is one we call saturation which is

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.560 
is is one we call saturation which is
basically<00:01:23.350> distortion<00:01:24.040> but<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.030> produces

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
basically distortion but it produces

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.020 
basically distortion but it produces
harmonics<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.590> interest<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.490> makes<00:01:27.850> it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
harmonics and interest and it makes it

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.180 
harmonics and interest and it makes it
warmer<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.659> richer<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.140> kind<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.710> fills<00:01:29.979> it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
warmer and richer and kind of fills it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.340 
warmer and richer and kind of fills it
out<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.729> it's<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:31.630> it's<00:01:31.750> creating<00:01:32.320> some

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
out and it's so it's creating some

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.920 
out and it's so it's creating some
harmonics<00:01:33.130> from<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.369> signal<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.119> then<00:01:34.780> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
harmonics from the signal and then the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.820 
harmonics from the signal and then the
second<00:01:35.350> one<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.770> what<00:01:36.520> we<00:01:36.550> call<00:01:36.940> comp<00:01:37.450> EQ<00:01:38.020> which

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
second one is what we call comp EQ which

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.120 
second one is what we call comp EQ which
is<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.149> multiband<00:01:40.149> compressor<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.890> can

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
is a multiband compressor so you can

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.330 
is a multiband compressor so you can
think<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.640> like<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.850> three-band

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
think of it like a three-band

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.260 
think of it like a three-band
touch-sensitive<00:01:45.340> EQ<00:01:46.300> so<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:47.560> tracks<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.369> with

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
touch-sensitive EQ so it tracks you with

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.419 
touch-sensitive EQ so it tracks you with
a<00:01:49.300> typical<00:01:49.810> EQ<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.440> cut<00:01:50.679> low<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.160> cut<00:01:51.310> the

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
a typical EQ you cut low you cut the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.680 
a typical EQ you cut low you cut the
bass<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:51.789> cut<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> mid<00:01:52.240> you've<00:01:52.450> got<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
bass you cut the mid you've got the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.290 
bass you cut the mid you've got the
treble<00:01:53.140> no<00:01:53.560> matter<00:01:53.800> how<00:01:54.009> hard<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.369> play<00:01:54.789> it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
treble no matter how hard you play it

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.840 
treble no matter how hard you play it
always<00:01:55.660> does<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.050> same<00:01:56.080> thing<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.640> a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
always does the same thing this is a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.900 
always does the same thing this is a
similar<00:01:58.570> idea<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.890> each<00:02:00.160> one<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.729> like<00:02:00.759> a

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
similar idea but each one is like a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.810 
similar idea but each one is like a
shock<00:02:01.300> absorber<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.679> can<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.369> 3-band

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
shock absorber so you can it's a 3-band

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.080 
shock absorber so you can it's a 3-band
EQ<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.570> set<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.679> you<00:02:05.800> just<00:02:06.039> dial<00:02:06.550> it<00:02:06.759> up<00:02:06.880> dial

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
EQ you set and you just dial it up dial

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.430 
EQ you set and you just dial it up dial
it<00:02:07.479> down<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:09.160> your<00:02:09.369> touch<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.080> when<00:02:11.350> you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
it down and to your touch so when you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.350 
it down and to your touch so when you
play<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.800> soft<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.459> does<00:02:12.670> one<00:02:12.910> thing<00:02:13.180> when

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
play in soft it does one thing when

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.479 
play in soft it does one thing when
you're<00:02:13.480> playing<00:02:13.750> hard<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.620> clamps<00:02:15.310> those

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
you're playing hard it clamps those

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.699 
you're playing hard it clamps those
unpleasant<00:02:15.910> frequencies<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.410> really

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
unpleasant frequencies and really

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.009 
unpleasant frequencies and really
releases<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> guitar<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.510> wouldn't

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
releases the guitar so you wouldn't

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.660 
releases the guitar so you wouldn't
think<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.350> something<00:02:20.890> called<00:02:21.130> compression

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
think that something called compression

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.479 
think that something called compression
could<00:02:22.420> make<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.660> guitar<00:02:22.900> sound<00:02:23.380> bigger<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
could make a guitar sound bigger but it

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.250 
could make a guitar sound bigger but it
actually<00:02:24.670> does<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.630> opens<00:02:26.049> up<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
actually does it really opens up the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.560 
actually does it really opens up the
sound<00:02:26.680> Wow<00:02:27.370> yeah<00:02:27.670> that's<00:02:28.060> wild<00:02:28.329> I'm<00:02:28.450> usually

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
sound Wow yeah that's wild I'm usually

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.449 
sound Wow yeah that's wild I'm usually
I'm<00:02:28.900> used<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.079> compression<00:02:29.440> being<00:02:29.890> kind<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I'm used to compression being kind of a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.280 
I'm used to compression being kind of a
restrictive<00:02:33.299> guitar<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:34.540> know<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:34.989> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
restrictive guitar you know if it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.080 
restrictive guitar you know if it
creates<00:02:35.590> harmonics<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.519> does<00:02:36.700> some<00:02:36.880> cool

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
creates harmonics and does some cool

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.420 
creates harmonics and does some cool
stuff<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.530> sits<00:02:38.829> on<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
stuff but it kind of sits on it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.600 
stuff but it kind of sits on it
but<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.570> only<00:02:40.720> narrow<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.890> there's<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.190> one

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
but this is only narrow so there's a one

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.130 
but this is only narrow so there's a one
at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> base<00:02:43.030> one<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> middle

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
at the base one in the middle

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.170 
at the base one in the middle
one<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.650> trouble<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.910> kind<00:02:46.120> of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
one on the trouble that just kind of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.480 
one on the trouble that just kind of
makes<00:02:46.360> things<00:02:46.660> freer<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.380> more<00:02:47.440> open<00:02:47.980> let's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
makes things freer and more open let's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.280 
makes things freer and more open let's
the<00:02:48.700> good<00:02:48.880> stuff<00:02:49.150> through<00:02:49.540> while<00:02:50.110> it's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
the good stuff through while it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.780 
the good stuff through while it's
sitting<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> stuff<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.580> don't

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
sitting on the stuff that you don't

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.730 
sitting on the stuff that you don't
necessarily<00:02:51.940> want<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.750> hear<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.560> it's

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
necessarily want to hear but it's

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.280 
necessarily want to hear but it's
dynamic<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:54.880> interesting<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.900> it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
dynamic and it's interesting and it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.710 
dynamic and it's interesting and it
feels<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.010> more<00:02:57.250> touch<00:02:57.520> sensitive<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.600> it's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
feels it's more touch sensitive so it's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
feels it's more touch sensitive so it's
more<00:02:58.840> fun<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.230> play<00:02:59.580> awesome<00:03:00.580> very<00:03:00.970> cool<00:03:01.060> so
