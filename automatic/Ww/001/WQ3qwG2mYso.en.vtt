00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.480 

the<00:00:03.570> impact<00:00:04.080> mesh<00:00:04.590> is<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.310> TPU<00:00:05.939> case<00:00:06.920> that<00:00:07.920> has

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the impact mesh is a TPU case that has

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.940 
the impact mesh is a TPU case that has
the<00:00:09.000> addition<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.440> layer<00:00:11.100> of<00:00:11.570> d3o<00:00:12.770> which<00:00:13.770> is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the addition of a layer of d3o which is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.779 
the addition of a layer of d3o which is
a<00:00:13.980> special<00:00:15.109> impact<00:00:16.109> resistant<00:00:16.830> gel<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.580> goes

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
a special impact resistant gel that goes

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.050 
a special impact resistant gel that goes
around<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.630> edges<00:00:19.200> of<00:00:19.440> the<00:00:19.590> case<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
around the edges of the case so it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
around the edges of the case so it
provides<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:21.780> good<00:00:21.990> impact<00:00:22.320> protection<00:00:22.619> on

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
provides very good impact protection on

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.260 
provides very good impact protection on
the<00:00:23.280> edges<00:00:23.840> you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.500> look<00:00:25.860> up<00:00:26.010> d3o<00:00:26.550> online

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
the edges you can look up d3o online

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.529 
the edges you can look up d3o online
it's<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.820> use<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.060> military

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's you has use in military

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's you has use in military
applications<00:00:30.830> it's<00:00:31.830> used<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.250> some

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
applications it's used in some

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.799 
applications it's used in some
motorcycle<00:00:33.629> gear<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.760> idea<00:00:36.089> of<00:00:36.359> it<00:00:36.569> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
motorcycle gear and the idea of it is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.279 
motorcycle gear and the idea of it is
that<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.979> a<00:00:38.190> relatively<00:00:39.179> soft<00:00:39.539> material

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
that it's a relatively soft material

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.709 
that it's a relatively soft material
that<00:00:40.589> when<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.159> encounters<00:00:41.699> impact<00:00:42.269> becomes

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that when it encounters impact becomes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
that when it encounters impact becomes
very<00:00:42.960> hard<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.339> protects<00:00:44.729> your<00:00:44.879> case<00:00:45.739> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
very hard so it protects your case so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
very hard so it protects your case so
this<00:00:47.479> impact<00:00:48.479> mesh<00:00:48.839> case<00:00:49.579> should<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.879> theory

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this impact mesh case should in theory

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.239 
this impact mesh case should in theory
be<00:00:51.749> very<00:00:52.199> protective<00:00:52.799> for<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.819> iPhone<00:00:54.359> 5<00:00:54.659> the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
be very protective for your iPhone 5 the

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.939 
be very protective for your iPhone 5 the
nice<00:00:56.249> thing<00:00:56.809> or<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> nice<00:00:58.649> things

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
nice thing or one of the nice things

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
nice thing or one of the nice things
about<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.579> case<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.749> I<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.049> it<00:01:01.199> in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about this case and here I have it in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
about this case and here I have it in
blue<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> iPhone<00:01:02.609> 5<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.339> really

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
blue for the iPhone 5 is that it really

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
blue for the iPhone 5 is that it really
is<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.840> large<00:01:07.140> case<00:01:07.680> usually<00:01:08.610> when

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
is not a very large case usually when

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
is not a very large case usually when
you<00:01:09.300> think<00:01:09.330> protective<00:01:10.200> case<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.800> think<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you think protective case you think that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.430 
you think protective case you think that
there<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.670> something<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.780> has<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.050> be<00:01:13.170> very

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
there has something that has to be very

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340 
there has something that has to be very
very<00:01:13.620> bulky<00:01:13.980> but<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:15.480> in<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> case

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
very bulky but actually in this case

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.600 
very bulky but actually in this case
it's<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.600> with<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> blue<00:01:18.990> case<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.310> see

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it's not with the blue case you can see

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330 
it's not with the blue case you can see
although<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> clear<00:01:21.450> blue<00:01:21.810> material<00:01:22.340> on

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
although it's a clear blue material on

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
although it's a clear blue material on
the<00:01:23.850> sides<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.080> sure<00:01:25.260> if<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the sides and I'm not sure if this is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.320 
the sides and I'm not sure if this is
going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:26.040> over<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.700> clearly<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
going to come over so clearly in the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to come over so clearly in the
video<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.530> sides<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
video but on the sides you can see that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.410 
video but on the sides you can see that
there<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:31.290> orange<00:01:31.980> band<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.940> is<00:01:33.090> visible

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
there is an orange band that is visible

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
there is an orange band that is visible
this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> d3o<00:01:34.590> material<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.550> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this is the d3o material that is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
this is the d3o material that is
supposed<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.000> protect<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.540> case<00:01:36.770> nicely

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
supposed to protect your case nicely

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
supposed to protect your case nicely
supposed<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.550> because<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.910> doubt<00:01:39.120> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
supposed to do not because I doubt it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
supposed to do not because I doubt it
but<00:01:39.540> simply<00:01:40.050> because<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.920> actually

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
but simply because I have not actually

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.330 
but simply because I have not actually
dropped<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:42.270> phone<00:01:42.480> in<00:01:42.540> its<00:01:43.020> case<00:01:43.340> however

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
dropped my phone in its case however

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.149 
dropped my phone in its case however
I've<00:01:44.640> seen<00:01:44.910> lots<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.300> videos<00:01:45.360> online<00:01:45.900> where

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
I've seen lots of videos online where

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
I've seen lots of videos online where
people<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.510> horrendous<00:01:48.510> things<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.560> their

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
people do horrendous things to their

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.330 
people do horrendous things to their
phones<00:01:50.010> while<00:01:50.460> they're<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> d3o<00:01:51.480> case<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
phones while they're in a d3o case and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
phones while they're in a d3o case and
they<00:01:53.340> emerge<00:01:53.790> unscathed<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.230> believe<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they emerge unscathed so I believe that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.110 
they emerge unscathed so I believe that
it<00:01:56.370> is<00:01:56.400> probably<00:01:56.940> very<00:01:57.150> very<00:01:57.240> protective<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
it is probably very very protective so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.550 
it is probably very very protective so
here<00:02:00.120> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.300> look<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.720> back<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.320> see

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
here if you look on the back you can see

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.899 
here if you look on the back you can see
the<00:02:02.220> mesh<00:02:02.790> effect<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:04.050> gives<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:05.100> device

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the mesh effect that gives this device

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.680 
the mesh effect that gives this device
the<00:02:06.300> impact<00:02:06.720> mesh<00:02:07.020> name<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.690> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the impact mesh name it is not it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.569 
the impact mesh name it is not it's
basically<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.229> pattern<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.769> little<00:02:10.979> dots<00:02:11.189> there

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
basically a pattern of little dots there

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.580 
basically a pattern of little dots there
are<00:02:12.269> no<00:02:12.480> actual<00:02:13.019> holes<00:02:13.319> here

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
are no actual holes here

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.380 
are no actual holes here
so<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.340> don't<00:02:15.459> have<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> worry<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:16.030> dirt

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
so you don't have to worry about dirt

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.240 
so you don't have to worry about dirt
getting<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.870> there<00:02:17.050> although<00:02:17.920> obviously

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
getting in there although obviously

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.150 
getting in there although obviously
there's<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.870> there<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> an<00:02:20.590> opening<00:02:20.950> for

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
there's there there is an opening for

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.250 
there's there there is an opening for
the<00:02:21.430> camera<00:02:21.819> here<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.240> top<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.050> know

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the camera here at the top so you know

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.400 
the camera here at the top so you know
potentially<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.270> suppose<00:02:25.780> could<00:02:26.050> get<00:02:26.230> some

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
potentially you I suppose could get some

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.910 
potentially you I suppose could get some
dirt<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.800> there<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.790> fits<00:02:28.060> very<00:02:28.510> flush<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
dirt in there but it fits very flush to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.340 
dirt in there but it fits very flush to
the<00:02:30.370> phone<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.600> think<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.140> would<00:02:32.230> be

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the phone so I don't think it would be

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.650 
the phone so I don't think it would be
very<00:02:32.560> easy<00:02:32.770> for<00:02:32.920> any<00:02:33.220> dirt<00:02:33.459> particles<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.510> get

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
very easy for any dirt particles to get

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.380 
very easy for any dirt particles to get
down<00:02:34.870> underneath<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:36.250> basically<00:02:36.730> yes<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.270> is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
down underneath but basically yes it is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.070 
down underneath but basically yes it is
not<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.830> simply<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.550> mesh<00:02:40.000> pattern<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.930> we

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
not it is simply a mesh pattern that we

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.990 
not it is simply a mesh pattern that we
are<00:02:41.170> looking<00:02:41.350> at<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.190> mesh<00:02:42.370> pattern<00:02:42.880> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
are looking at and the mesh pattern is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.360 
are looking at and the mesh pattern is
on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.270> inside<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.620> outside<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
on the inside on the outside of the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.570 
on the inside on the outside of the
smooth<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.320> going<00:02:47.470> along<00:02:47.709> here<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.340> other

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
smooth so going along here to the other

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.360 
smooth so going along here to the other
side<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> phone<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.620> see<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:51.160> have

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
side of the phone you can see we have

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.060 
side of the phone you can see we have
the<00:02:52.150> volume<00:02:52.720> buttons<00:02:53.050> are<00:02:53.260> nicely<00:02:53.500> covered

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the volume buttons are nicely covered

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.890 
the volume buttons are nicely covered
and<00:02:54.340> there's<00:02:55.090> they're<00:02:55.480> still<00:02:55.750> very

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
and there's they're still very

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.770 
and there's they're still very
responsive<00:02:56.680> underneath<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.250> TPU<00:02:57.640> TPU<00:02:58.390> cover

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
responsive underneath the TPU TPU cover

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.520 
responsive underneath the TPU TPU cover
and<00:02:59.280> then<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.610> our<00:03:00.730> sleep<00:03:01.060> our<00:03:01.780> mute

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and then we have our sleep our mute

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.710 
and then we have our sleep our mute
switch<00:03:02.800> here<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.790> going<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.390> top

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
switch here and it's going to the top

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.380 
switch here and it's going to the top
this<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.680> what<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> was<00:03:09.100> trying<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.790> say<00:03:09.970> before

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
this is what I was trying to say before

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.350 
this is what I was trying to say before
here<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.900> have<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.350> sleep/wake<00:03:12.010> button<00:03:12.360> again

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
here we have the sleep/wake button again

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.820 
here we have the sleep/wake button again
very<00:03:13.900> good<00:03:14.019> tactile<00:03:14.560> response<00:03:14.860> on<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.580> it's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
very good tactile response on that it's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.620 
very good tactile response on that it's
sometimes<00:03:17.830> with<00:03:18.040> TPU<00:03:18.370> cases<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.239> be<00:03:19.299> hard

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
sometimes with TPU cases it can be hard

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.000 
sometimes with TPU cases it can be hard
to<00:03:19.840> press<00:03:20.049> this<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:23.110> think<00:03:23.140> previously

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
to press this but and I think previously

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.960 
to press this but and I think previously

tech21
cases<00:03:25.720> had<00:03:26.140> some<00:03:26.380> issues<00:03:26.650> with<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.070> for<00:03:27.910> some

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
cases had some issues with this for some

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.120 
cases had some issues with this for some
other<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> phone<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.410> had<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.950> past

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
other for a phone that I had in the past

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.000 
other for a phone that I had in the past
there<00:03:31.030> was<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> problem<00:03:31.630> with<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.620> tactile

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
there was a problem with the tactile

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.979 
there was a problem with the tactile
response<00:03:33.310> for<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.000> button<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.810> has

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
response for this button but that has

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.509 
response for this button but that has
really<00:03:35.320> been<00:03:35.470> solved<00:03:35.950> with<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:36.250> case

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
really been solved with this case

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.390 
really been solved with this case
because<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.180> find<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.200> very<00:03:38.680> responsive

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
because I find it to be very responsive

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.490 
because I find it to be very responsive
but<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.269> also<00:03:40.420> nice<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.720> know<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:40.989> it's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
but it's also nice to know that it's

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.840 
but it's also nice to know that it's
protected<00:03:42.010> here<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:44.010> if<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.040> move<00:03:45.280> along<00:03:45.549> here

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
protected here and if we move along here

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.330 
protected here and if we move along here
to<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.120> bottom<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.890> see<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.940> we've<00:03:49.329> got

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
to the bottom you can see that we've got

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.220 
to the bottom you can see that we've got
good<00:03:51.340> protection<00:03:51.820> along<00:03:52.299> here<00:03:52.750> we've<00:03:53.019> got

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
good protection along here we've got

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.030 
good protection along here we've got
cutouts<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:53.890> our<00:03:54.040> speaker<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:56.040> obviously

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
cutouts for our speaker and obviously

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.069 
cutouts for our speaker and obviously
the<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.340> headphones<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.690> Lightning

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
the the headphones and the Lightning

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.800 
the the headphones and the Lightning
port<00:03:59.340> now<00:04:00.340> there<00:04:00.670> are<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.150> will<00:04:01.450> say<00:04:01.630> there's

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
port now there are I will say there's

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.740 
port now there are I will say there's
two<00:04:02.170> versions<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:03.220> tech21<00:04:03.700> made<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.630> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
two versions that tech21 made of the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.630 
two versions that tech21 made of the
impact<00:04:04.840> mesh<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.799> believe<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.459> first

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
impact mesh I believe that the first

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.270 
impact mesh I believe that the first
version<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.450> they<00:04:07.570> made<00:04:07.890> everything<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.130> was

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
version that they made everything it was

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.099 
version that they made everything it was
all<00:04:09.430> open<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.120> bottom<00:04:10.480> there<00:04:10.750> these

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
all open on the bottom there these

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.319 
all open on the bottom there these
little<00:04:12.120> protective<00:04:14.070> bars<00:04:15.070> here<00:04:15.640> were<00:04:15.880> not<00:04:16.120> in

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
little protective bars here were not in

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.690 
little protective bars here were not in
place<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:17.229> think<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.950> they<00:04:18.190> got<00:04:18.370> some

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
place I think that they got some

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.640 
place I think that they got some
customer<00:04:19.180> feedback<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:20.049> this<00:04:20.260> was<00:04:20.470> not

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
customer feedback that this was not

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.360 
customer feedback that this was not
optimal<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.850> they<00:04:22.570> put<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> revised<00:04:23.650> case<00:04:24.099> on

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
optimal so they put a revised case on

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.850 
optimal so they put a revised case on
the<00:04:24.460> market<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.270> revised<00:04:25.599> version

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
the market this is the revised version

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040 
the market this is the revised version
and<00:04:27.069> to<00:04:27.550> me<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:27.849> it's<00:04:28.180> perfect<00:04:28.599> it's<00:04:28.750> really

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
and to me it's it's perfect it's really

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.800 
and to me it's it's perfect it's really
it's<00:04:29.199> firm<00:04:29.470> it's<00:04:29.919> not<00:04:30.159> this<00:04:30.909> is<00:04:31.120> not<00:04:31.270> loose<00:04:31.569> and

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it's firm it's not this is not loose and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.490 
it's firm it's not this is not loose and
floppy<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.319> sometimes<00:04:32.710> you'll<00:04:32.949> get<00:04:33.189> with<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
floppy is sometimes you'll get with the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.059 
floppy is sometimes you'll get with the
TPU<00:04:36.189> at<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.460> bottom<00:04:36.759> of<00:04:36.879> the<00:04:36.969> case<00:04:38.069> everything

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
TPU at the bottom of the case everything

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.129 
TPU at the bottom of the case everything
on<00:04:39.219> here<00:04:39.520> fits<00:04:39.969> perfectly<00:04:40.599> fit<00:04:41.229> smoothly<00:04:41.729> I

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
on here fits perfectly fit smoothly I

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.510 
on here fits perfectly fit smoothly I
feel<00:04:44.139> like<00:04:44.379> my<00:04:44.560> case<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.979> marvelously

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
feel like my case is marvelously

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.850 
feel like my case is marvelously
protected<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:47.020> color<00:04:47.229> is

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
protected and the color is

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.110 
protected and the color is
it's<00:04:48.159> just<00:04:48.460> enchanting<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.150> white<00:04:49.389> iPhone<00:04:49.689> I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
it's just enchanting on a white iPhone I

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.520 
it's just enchanting on a white iPhone I
think<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.210> probably<00:04:52.330> also<00:04:52.719> looks<00:04:53.139> good<00:04:53.379> on<00:04:53.409> a

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
think it probably also looks good on a

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.920 
think it probably also looks good on a
black<00:04:53.860> iPhone<00:04:54.280> maybe<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:55.180> not<00:04:55.509> quite<00:04:55.780> as

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
black iPhone maybe just not quite as

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.040 
black iPhone maybe just not quite as
pretty<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:57.150> finally<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.389> as<00:04:58.509> a<00:04:58.539> little<00:04:58.840> size

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
pretty and finally just as a little size

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.869 
pretty and finally just as a little size
comparison<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.949> is<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.219> case<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.669> used

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
comparison this is the case that I used

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.950 
comparison this is the case that I used
to<00:05:01.000> have<00:05:01.150> on<00:05:01.300> my<00:05:01.330> phone

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
to have on my phone

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.450 
to have on my phone
it's<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.919> speck<00:05:03.159> CandyShell<00:05:03.629> so<00:05:04.629> I'm<00:05:04.960> just

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
it's the speck CandyShell so I'm just

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.999 
it's the speck CandyShell so I'm just
going<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.550> put<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.449> next<00:05:07.659> to<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.379> candy<00:05:08.740> shell

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
going to put it next to the candy shell

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.119 
going to put it next to the candy shell
candy<00:05:09.940> shell<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.240> also<00:05:10.389> very<00:05:11.110> very<00:05:11.560> nice<00:05:11.800> case

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
candy shell is also very very nice case

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.950 
candy shell is also very very nice case
so<00:05:13.229> looking<00:05:14.229> at<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:15.009> two<00:05:15.250> cases<00:05:16.060> side-by-side

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
so looking at the two cases side-by-side

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.110 
so looking at the two cases side-by-side
you<00:05:17.349> can<00:05:17.860> see<00:05:18.279> that<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:20.129> tech21<00:05:21.129> case<00:05:21.669> may<00:05:22.090> be

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
you can see that the tech21 case may be

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.010 
you can see that the tech21 case may be
very<00:05:22.900> very<00:05:23.620> slightly<00:05:24.099> taller<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:27.580> is

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
very very slightly taller and it is

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.980 
very very slightly taller and it is
marginally<00:05:29.370> wider<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.639> would<00:05:31.029> say<00:05:31.300> but<00:05:31.629> not<00:05:31.779> by

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
marginally wider I would say but not by

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.309 
marginally wider I would say but not by
much<00:05:32.460> but<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.729> is<00:05:33.849> actually<00:05:34.629> a<00:05:34.659> little<00:05:35.050> bit

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
much but it is actually a little bit

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.189 
much but it is actually a little bit
less<00:05:36.099> thick<00:05:36.639> and<00:05:37.029> I<00:05:37.240> think<00:05:37.509> this<00:05:37.659> is<00:05:37.810> because

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
less thick and I think this is because

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.279 
less thick and I think this is because
the<00:05:38.319> protection<00:05:38.889> that<00:05:38.919> tech21<00:05:39.400> is<00:05:40.389> offering

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
the protection that tech21 is offering

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.709 
the protection that tech21 is offering
is<00:05:41.620> on<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.190> sides<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:43.000> not<00:05:43.089> so<00:05:43.300> much<00:05:43.449> on<00:05:43.629> the

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
is on the sides and not so much on the

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.480 
is on the sides and not so much on the
back<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.650> actually<00:05:45.339> the<00:05:46.529> speck<00:05:47.529> case<00:05:47.800> comes<00:05:48.339> up

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
back so actually the speck case comes up

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.369 
back so actually the speck case comes up
a<00:05:48.610> little<00:05:48.759> bit<00:05:49.060> higher<00:05:49.360> than<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.940> tech21

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
a little bit higher than the tech21

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.040 
a little bit higher than the tech21
impact<00:05:53.379> mesh<00:05:54.000> although<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.180> I<00:05:55.659> would<00:05:55.900> say

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
impact mesh although the I would say

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.809 
impact mesh although the I would say
that<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.379> lip<00:05:56.589> on<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.889> impact<00:05:57.339> mesh<00:05:57.580> is

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
that the lip on the impact mesh is

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.659 
that the lip on the impact mesh is
probably<00:05:58.419> a<00:05:58.449> little<00:05:58.810> bit<00:05:59.050> higher<00:05:59.860> very

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
probably a little bit higher very

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.790 
probably a little bit higher very
slightly<00:06:01.029> than<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:02.080> speck<00:06:02.610> overall<00:06:03.610> I

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
slightly than the speck overall I

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.189 
slightly than the speck overall I
although<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.919> liked<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.819> speck<00:06:07.089> on<00:06:07.389> it<00:06:07.599> the

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
although I liked the speck on it the

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.930 
although I liked the speck on it the
feel<00:06:08.529> of<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.919> speck<00:06:09.190> was<00:06:09.370> always<00:06:09.729> a<00:06:09.759> little

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
feel of the speck was always a little

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.459 
feel of the speck was always a little
bit<00:06:10.089> on<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.419> slippery<00:06:10.900> side<00:06:11.699> and<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:14.110> really

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
bit on the slippery side and you really

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.459 
bit on the slippery side and you really
do<00:06:14.800> not<00:06:14.979> get<00:06:15.339> that<00:06:15.370> with<00:06:16.029> the<00:06:16.180> impact<00:06:16.569> mesh<00:06:16.810> you

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
do not get that with the impact mesh you

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.709 
do not get that with the impact mesh you
have<00:06:17.650> it's<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.930> is<00:06:20.379> just<00:06:21.039> slippery<00:06:21.669> enough<00:06:22.060> so

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
have it's it is just slippery enough so

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.059 
have it's it is just slippery enough so
that<00:06:22.839> it<00:06:22.960> goes<00:06:23.050> in<00:06:23.289> and<00:06:23.469> out<00:06:23.500> of<00:06:23.560> pockets

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
that it goes in and out of pockets

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.809 
that it goes in and out of pockets
easily<00:06:24.520> but<00:06:25.409> in<00:06:26.409> your<00:06:26.620> hand<00:06:26.949> you<00:06:27.430> never<00:06:27.639> feel

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
easily but in your hand you never feel

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.510 
easily but in your hand you never feel
like<00:06:27.879> you're<00:06:28.150> likely<00:06:28.539> to<00:06:28.810> drop<00:06:28.990> it<00:06:29.460> it's<00:06:30.460> a

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
like you're likely to drop it it's a

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.209 
like you're likely to drop it it's a
very<00:06:30.639> nice<00:06:30.879> feeling<00:06:31.210> case<00:06:31.599> and<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.770> feel

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
very nice feeling case and I feel

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.159 
very nice feeling case and I feel
confident<00:06:33.699> that<00:06:33.819> it<00:06:34.270> will<00:06:34.389> protect<00:06:34.629> my<00:06:34.959> phone

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
confident that it will protect my phone

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.170 
confident that it will protect my phone
