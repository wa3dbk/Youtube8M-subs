of<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> target<00:04:46.460> superelevation<00:04:47.460> increases

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
of the target superelevation increases

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.210 
of the target superelevation increases
as<00:04:48.360> advanced<00:04:49.290> range<00:04:49.680> increases<00:04:51.800> but<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:53.010> in

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
as advanced range increases but not in
