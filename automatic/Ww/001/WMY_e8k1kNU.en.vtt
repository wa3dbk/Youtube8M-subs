in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> middle<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.259> essentially<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
in the middle you have essentially the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
in the middle you have essentially the
sample<00:01:46.680> buttons<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.490> hit<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
sample buttons so you can hit this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
sample buttons so you can hit this
samples<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> easiest<00:01:50.070> things<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
samples so one of the easiest things to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
samples so one of the easiest things to
do<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> game<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.210> people

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
do in the game and the thing that people

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
do in the game and the thing that people
can<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> most<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.520> able

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
can do the most is to actually be able

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.740 
can do the most is to actually be able
to<00:01:53.790> press<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> buttons<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.600> able<00:01:54.659> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to press the buttons and be able to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.039 
to press the buttons and be able to
scratch<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.700> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.729> mixer<00:01:57.060> side<00:01:57.240> we've

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
scratch the way on the mixer side we've

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569 
scratch the way on the mixer side we've
got<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> cross<00:01:58.409> fader<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> crossfade

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
got the cross fader so if you crossfade

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.190 
got the cross fader so if you crossfade
over<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> left<00:02:00.270> hand<00:02:00.450> side<00:02:00.539> we're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
over to the left hand side we're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
over to the left hand side we're
actually<00:02:01.289> just<00:02:01.590> playing<00:02:01.860> record<00:02:02.210> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
actually just playing record you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.370 
actually just playing record you
crossfade<00:02:03.539> all<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> way<00:02:03.869> over<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> right

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
crossfade all the way over to the right

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
crossfade all the way over to the right
hand<00:02:04.590> side<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.009> blame<00:02:05.429> representative

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
hand side you just blame representative

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.969 
hand side you just blame representative
and<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> leave<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> middle<00:02:07.530> with

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and if you leave it in the middle with

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.089 
and if you leave it in the middle with
Lane<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.190> freckles<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.590> again<00:02:10.590> during<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
Lane got freckles so again during the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
Lane got freckles so again during the
different<00:02:11.370> difficulties<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.480> cross

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
different difficulties you have cross

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.479 
different difficulties you have cross
fades<00:02:13.050> but<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.440> also<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.800> soon<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.310> get

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
fades but then also as soon as you get

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.949 
fades but then also as soon as you get
into<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> heart<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.000> difficulties<00:02:15.510> you're

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
into the heart of difficulties you're

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.300 
into the heart of difficulties you're
actually<00:02:16.080> quite<00:02:16.410> rapidly<00:02:16.739> cross-reference

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
actually quite rapidly cross-reference

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.490 
actually quite rapidly cross-reference
with<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.489> two<00:02:17.610> records<00:02:18.230> we<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.349> what<00:02:19.470> we

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
with the two records we have what we

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740 
with the two records we have what we
call<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> effect<00:02:20.280> style<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.600> actually

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
call the effect style so this actually

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.770 
call the effect style so this actually
allows<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.610> add<00:02:23.610> effect<00:02:23.970> over<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> music

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
allows you to add effect over the music

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.360 
allows you to add effect over the music
so<00:02:24.930> there's<00:02:25.110> different<00:02:25.470> parts<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.130> song

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so there's different parts of the song

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.890 
so there's different parts of the song
that<00:02:26.430> allow<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.450> able<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.720> manipulate

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that allow you to be able to manipulate

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.960 
that allow you to be able to manipulate
the<00:02:28.260> effect<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:29.100> increase<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.549> picture<00:02:29.880> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the effect to increase the picture of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.850 
the effect to increase the picture of
James<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.269> tongue<00:02:30.480> music<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.680> all

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
James the tongue music and this all

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.100 
James the tongue music and this all
would<00:02:31.980> call<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.459> forever<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.780> again

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
would call are you forever so again

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.009 
would call are you forever so again
similar<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.799> one<00:02:34.950> by<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> time<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.870> you'll

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
similar to the one by the time so you'll

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.100 
similar to the one by the time so you'll
earn<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.440> point

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
earn this point

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.630 
earn this point
and<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:39.710> at<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> top<00:02:39.920> gear<00:02:40.250> we<00:02:40.370> have<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and then at the top gear we have the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
and then at the top gear we have the
native<00:02:40.910> controls<00:02:41.150> from<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> hard<00:02:41.720> way<00:02:41.840> so

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
native controls from the hard way so

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.520 
native controls from the hard way so
tucked<00:02:42.830> away<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.490> have<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> nice<00:02:44.270> authentic

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
tucked away so we have a nice authentic

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.800 
tucked away so we have a nice authentic
style<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> profile<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:47.330> again<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.660> can

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
style to the profile but again you can

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.060 
style to the profile but again you can
drive<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.110> menu<00:02:48.380> system<00:02:50.740> it's<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.860> bit

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
drive the menu system it's a bit

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.860 
drive the menu system it's a bit
abstract<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.150> I'm<00:02:53.270> wondering<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.780> can

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
abstract but I'm wondering if you can

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.220 
abstract but I'm wondering if you can
explain<00:02:53.930> sort<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.850> note<00:02:56.510> highway<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.050> how

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
explain sort of the note highway and how

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.390 
explain sort of the note highway and how
this<00:02:57.740> Hardware<00:02:58.670> translates<00:02:59.180> into<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.630> game

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
this Hardware translates into the game

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.280 
this Hardware translates into the game
how<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.460> interact<00:03:01.940> with<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.300> songs<00:03:02.540> yeah

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
how you interact with the songs yeah

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.290 
how you interact with the songs yeah
sure<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.830> one<00:03:04.310> difference<00:03:04.460> that<00:03:05.180> you'll

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
sure so the one difference that you'll

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.850 
sure so the one difference that you'll
notice<00:03:05.480> straightaway<00:03:05.840> with<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.290> DJ<00:03:06.560> here<00:03:06.590> on

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
notice straightaway with the DJ here on

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.230 
notice straightaway with the DJ here on
the<00:03:06.980> highway<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.640> there<00:03:07.760> are<00:03:07.790> only<00:03:07.940> three

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
the highway is that there are only three

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.840 
the highway is that there are only three
streams<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.680> from<00:03:10.130> beginner<00:03:10.459> all<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.730> way

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
streams so from beginner all the way

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.710 
streams so from beginner all the way
through<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.090> hard<00:03:11.390> you're<00:03:11.570> actually

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
through to hard you're actually

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.020 
through to hard you're actually
operating<00:03:12.290> three<00:03:12.470> streams<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.850> three

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
operating three streams so the three

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.460 
operating three streams so the three
streams<00:03:14.300> as<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.480> say<00:03:14.690> map<00:03:14.930> onto<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> three

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
streams as I say map onto the three

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.430 
streams as I say map onto the three
buttons<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:15.860> are<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.070> your<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.520> your<00:03:16.550> platter

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
buttons that are on your on your platter

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.610 
buttons that are on your on your platter
where<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.560> complexity<00:03:19.100> starts<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.550> add<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.880> is

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
where the complexity starts to add in is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.260 
where the complexity starts to add in is
being<00:03:21.620> able<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.890> cross<00:03:22.100> fade<00:03:22.340> between<00:03:22.760> streams

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
being able to cross fade between streams

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.300 
being able to cross fade between streams
also<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.320> begin<00:03:24.620> with<00:03:24.800> what<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.040> do<00:03:25.190> when

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
also to begin with what you do when

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.410 
also to begin with what you do when
you're<00:03:25.430> scratching<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:26.000> what<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.270> call

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
you're scratching is what we call

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.390 
you're scratching is what we call
freestyle<00:03:26.840> scraps<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.530> really<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.280> doesn't

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
freestyle scraps so really it doesn't

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.590 
freestyle scraps so really it doesn't
matter<00:03:28.610> what<00:03:28.730> direction<00:03:28.940> you're<00:03:29.390> scratching

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
matter what direction you're scratching

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.240 
matter what direction you're scratching
in<00:03:29.900> you're<00:03:30.410> going<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.590> be<00:03:30.680> able<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.920> hit<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> as

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
in you're going to be able to hit it as

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.770 
in you're going to be able to hit it as
long<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.670> start<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.360> start<00:03:32.420> of<00:03:32.690> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
long as you start at the start of the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.300 
long as you start at the start of the
scratching<00:03:33.260> at<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.440> end<00:03:33.590> good<00:03:33.800> absolutely<00:03:33.950> of

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
scratching at the end good absolutely of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.490 
scratching at the end good absolutely of
that<00:03:34.430> scratch<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.880> way<00:03:35.030> as<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.020> start<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.320> get

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that scratch of way as you start to get

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500 
that scratch of way as you start to get
into<00:03:36.920> hardened<00:03:37.280> into<00:03:37.400> expert<00:03:37.850> you'll

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
into hardened into expert you'll

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.750 
into hardened into expert you'll
actually<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:38.989> directional<00:03:39.560> scratches<00:03:39.980> so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
actually see directional scratches so

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.670 
actually see directional scratches so
you<00:03:40.880> actually<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.450> hold<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:42.020> scratch<00:03:42.380> in

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
you actually have to hold and scratch in

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.800 
you actually have to hold and scratch in
the<00:03:42.800> direction<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.239> then<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.510> starts

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
the direction and then it starts

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.270 
the direction and then it starts
layering<00:03:45.019> up<00:03:45.260> from<00:03:45.470> there<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:45.950> could<00:03:46.100> be

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
layering up from there so you could be

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.220 
layering up from there so you could be
expected<00:03:47.060> up<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.330> up<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.630> then<00:03:47.930> having<00:03:48.110> to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
expected up and up and then having to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.600 
expected up and up and then having to
rewind<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.709> whole<00:03:48.920> deck<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.430> on<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.549> so

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
rewind the whole deck and so on and so

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.830 
rewind the whole deck and so on and so
forth<00:03:49.700> so<00:03:49.970> we're<00:03:50.090> kind<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.299> layering<00:03:50.570> on

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
forth so we're kind of layering on

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.100 
forth so we're kind of layering on
complexity<00:03:51.400> great<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:53.090> if<00:03:53.330> one<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:53.930> things

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
complexity great so if one of the things

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.390 
complexity great so if one of the things
about<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> hardware<00:03:54.470> i<00:03:54.590> should<00:03:54.739> mention<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:55.190> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
about the hardware i should mention is a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.130 
about the hardware i should mention is a
cool<00:03:55.670> things<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.450> detach<00:03:56.900> this

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
cool things you can actually detach this

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.110 
cool things you can actually detach this
and<00:03:57.410> make<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.709> friendly<00:03:58.400> for<00:03:58.610> lefties<00:03:58.880> right

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
and make it friendly for lefties right

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.940 
and make it friendly for lefties right
yeah<00:03:59.330> that's<00:03:59.450> right<00:03:59.690> so<00:03:59.989> we<00:04:00.769> have<00:04:00.920> a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
yeah that's right so we have a

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.949 
yeah that's right so we have a
disconnect<00:04:01.370> button<00:04:01.459> here<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.090> again<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.930> can

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
disconnect button here and again you can

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.900 
disconnect button here and again you can
just<00:04:03.200> pull<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.380> out<00:04:03.500> take<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.310> mixer<00:04:04.610> turn

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
just pull that out take the mixer turn

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.820 
just pull that out take the mixer turn
around<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.870> if<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.049> left<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.380> flip<00:04:06.590> or<00:04:06.739> if

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
around and so if you left the flip or if

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.750 
around and so if you left the flip or if
you<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:06.920> prefer<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.310> play<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:07.730> a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
you just prefer to play it in a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.250 
you just prefer to play it in a
different<00:04:07.940> configuration<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.840> can<00:04:08.959> do<00:04:09.110> that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
different configuration you can do that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.530 
different configuration you can do that
very<00:04:09.799> cool<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.430> one<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.299> things<00:04:11.360> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
very cool so one of the things that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.210 
very cool so one of the things that
guitar<00:04:12.019> hero<00:04:12.260> has<00:04:12.410> done<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.709> past<00:04:12.799> and

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
guitar hero has done in the past and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.640 
guitar hero has done in the past and
other<00:04:14.000> rhythm<00:04:14.450> games<00:04:14.660> they've<00:04:15.080> allowed<00:04:15.380> you

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
other rhythm games they've allowed you

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.210 
other rhythm games they've allowed you
to<00:04:15.769> have<00:04:15.950> some<00:04:16.340> at<00:04:16.640> least<00:04:16.880> some<00:04:17.950> ability<00:04:18.950> to

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
to have some at least some ability to

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.550 
to have some at least some ability to
express<00:04:20.030> yourself<00:04:20.239> some<00:04:20.690> freestyle<00:04:21.080> moments

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
express yourself some freestyle moments

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.590 
express yourself some freestyle moments
what<00:04:22.340> what<00:04:22.580> does<00:04:22.669> DJ<00:04:22.880> here<00:04:23.180> are<00:04:23.270> going<00:04:23.450> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
what what does DJ here are going to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.840 
what what does DJ here are going to
allow<00:04:24.229> you<00:04:24.290> to<00:04:24.410> do<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.830> thing<00:04:25.010> yeah<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.700> we

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
allow you to do in that thing yeah so we

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.450 
allow you to do in that thing yeah so we
have<00:04:26.030> free<00:04:26.570> soft<00:04:26.780> samples<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:28.070> different

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
have free soft samples so different

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760 
have free soft samples so different
parts<00:04:28.729> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.880> track<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.510> can<00:04:29.540> actually<00:04:30.080> load

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
parts of the track you can actually load

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.770 
parts of the track you can actually load
up<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.130> from<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.880> preset<00:04:32.300> list<00:04:32.479> that<00:04:32.660> you've

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
up and from a preset list that you've

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.120 
up and from a preset list that you've
decided<00:04:33.080> their<00:04:33.350> samples<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:33.890> really

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
decided their samples that you really

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.860 
decided their samples that you really
like<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:35.000> load<00:04:35.180> them<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.720> can

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
like you can load them up and you can

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.290 
like you can load them up and you can
actually<00:04:35.990> play<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> freestyle<00:04:36.770> samples<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.370> lot

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
actually play a freestyle samples a lot

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.820 
actually play a freestyle samples a lot
of<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.510> other<00:04:38.600> areas<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:38.960> expression<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.650> that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
of the other areas of expression is that

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.409 
of the other areas of expression is that
you<00:04:39.919> build<00:04:40.190> up<00:04:40.310> through<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:40.760> game<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
you build up through the game the

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.390 
you build up through the game the
opportunity<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.050> rewind<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.620> opportunity<00:04:43.100> to

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
opportunity to rewind the opportunity to

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.070 
opportunity to rewind the opportunity to
euphoria<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.390> can<00:04:44.540> actually<00:04:44.690> execute

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
euphoria and you can actually execute

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.719 
euphoria and you can actually execute
those<00:04:45.350> anytime<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.919> like<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.640> the

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
those anytime you like so the

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.159 
those anytime you like so the
interesting<00:04:46.910> thing<00:04:47.210> about<00:04:47.240> rewind<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:47.990> that

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
interesting thing about rewind is that

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.469 
interesting thing about rewind is that

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
you build it up but very very few people

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.850 
you build it up but very very few people
execute<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:50.960> straight<00:04:51.200> away<00:04:51.229> you<00:04:51.410> pick

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
execute it straight away you pick

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.610

points<00:04:56.040> go<00:04:56.639> through<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.210> rewind<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.080> you

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
points go through it you rewind it you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.870 
points go through it you rewind it you
go<00:04:58.410> back<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.830> highway<00:04:58.979> and<00:04:59.370> then<00:04:59.699> you<00:04:59.790> get

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
go back to the highway and then you get

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.950

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
again so you can actually multiply those

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.400 
again so you can actually multiply those
points<00:05:03.060> all<00:05:03.510> right<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:03.930> final<00:05:04.050> question

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410
