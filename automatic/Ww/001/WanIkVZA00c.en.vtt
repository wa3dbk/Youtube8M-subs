I've tried with my with my eating habit

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
I've tried with my with my eating habit
because<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.680> always<00:00:58.859> trying<00:00:59.489> something<00:00:59.850> new

because I'm always trying something new

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
because I'm always trying something new
just<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.710> works<00:01:02.219> without

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just to see like what works without

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.950 
just to see like what works without
having<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.080> sacrifice<00:01:04.860> any<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:05.729> points<00:01:06.150> um

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
having to sacrifice any of my points um

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
having to sacrifice any of my points um
so<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> I've<00:01:08.010> tried<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.450> UH<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so something that I've tried is a UH it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.370 
so something that I've tried is a UH it
is<00:01:13.320> um<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:14.549> i<00:01:14.850> want<00:01:15.750> trying<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> say<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
is um because i want trying to say like

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
is um because i want trying to say like
before<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.640> cutoff<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.869> eat<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.500> ten

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
before my cutoff time to eat was ten

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
before my cutoff time to eat was ten
o'clock<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.400> wouldn't<00:01:20.850> eat<00:01:20.939> anything<00:01:21.090> after

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
o'clock so i wouldn't eat anything after

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.499 
o'clock so i wouldn't eat anything after
ten<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:22.040> find<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.340> effective<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.240> eat

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
ten i find it more effective to not eat

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
ten i find it more effective to not eat
even<00:01:24.720> earlier<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:25.590> i<00:01:25.619> mean<00:01:25.860> obviously<00:01:26.460> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
even earlier well i mean obviously but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
even earlier well i mean obviously but
um<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.439> still<00:01:28.680> eat<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.159> points

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
um like I would still eat all my points

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.780 
um like I would still eat all my points
but<00:01:30.240> i<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.659> eat<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:32.070> my

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
but i would eat all of them like my

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
but i would eat all of them like my
cutoff<00:01:33.090> time<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.540> earlier<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.290> my

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
cutoff time would be earlier so when my

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
cutoff time would be earlier so when my
new<00:01:34.590> cut<00:01:34.860> off<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.460> eight<00:01:35.670> o'clock<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> i

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
new cut off time is eight o'clock and i

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.270 
new cut off time is eight o'clock and i
find<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.829> been<00:01:38.189> working<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.759> well

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
find that it's been working really well

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.740 
find that it's been working really well
another<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> tried<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.270> eating

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
another thing that I tried is eating

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
another thing that I tried is eating
smaller<00:01:43.110> meals<00:01:43.520> throughout<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> day<00:01:44.759> instead

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
smaller meals throughout the day instead

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.880 
smaller meals throughout the day instead
of<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:46.110> having<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.790> bring<00:01:48.060> me<00:01:48.240> also

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
of just having to really bring me also

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.770 
of just having to really bring me also
that's<00:01:49.890> also<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.909> some<00:01:51.270> things<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that's also you know some things to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.510 
that's also you know some things to
think<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> guys<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:52.950> struggling

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
think about if you guys are struggling

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
think about if you guys are struggling
um<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.159> what<00:01:56.159> else<00:01:56.340> yeah<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:58.110> that's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
um and what else yeah I think that's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
um and what else yeah I think that's
pretty<00:01:59.250> much<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.850> mean<00:02:00.119> there's<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.570> days

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pretty much I mean there's some days

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
pretty much I mean there's some days
when<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> don't<00:02:01.469> follow<00:02:01.680> those<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.219> because

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
when I don't follow those just because

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
when I don't follow those just because
I'm<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.600> busy<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.469> have

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I'm really busy and I just don't have

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.859 
I'm really busy and I just don't have
time<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.340> eat<00:02:05.610> smaller<00:02:05.969> meals<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
time to like eat smaller meals on the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.309 
time to like eat smaller meals on the
