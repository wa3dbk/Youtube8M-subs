hit<00:03:13.420> those<00:03:13.690> notes<00:03:13.959> exactly<00:03:14.819> while<00:03:15.819> you're

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
hit those notes exactly while you're

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.240 
hit those notes exactly while you're
doing<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.209> because<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:17.680> doesn't<00:03:17.950> really

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
doing it because you it doesn't really

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:28.089 
doing it because you it doesn't really
matter<00:03:18.459> if<00:03:18.580> you're<00:03:18.730> not<00:03:18.849> exact<00:03:19.269> okay

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.280 

if<00:03:28.280> you're<00:03:28.430> close<00:03:28.670> enough<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:29.599> think<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.049> sounds

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
if you're close enough I think it sounds

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:39.670 
if you're close enough I think it sounds
good<00:03:30.439> so

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.229 

you<00:03:40.069> can<00:03:40.219> see<00:03:40.400> I'm<00:03:40.579> more<00:03:40.790> or<00:03:40.879> less<00:03:40.909> hitting

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
you can see I'm more or less hitting

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.089 
you can see I'm more or less hitting
some<00:03:41.420> other<00:03:41.569> strings<00:03:41.870> around<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:43.010> it

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
some other strings around that and it

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.849 
some other strings around that and it
doesn't<00:03:43.310> sound<00:03:43.549> too<00:03:43.700> bad<00:03:43.939> I<00:03:43.969> don't<00:03:44.150> think

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
doesn't sound too bad I don't think

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.020 
doesn't sound too bad I don't think
right<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.310> then<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.120> get<00:03:47.299> into<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.599> song
