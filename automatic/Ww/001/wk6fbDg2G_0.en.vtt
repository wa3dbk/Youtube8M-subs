00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello today we'll talk about 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.000
 such accessories for strollers 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 like a rain coat today we went out 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.060
 walk with your child and took with you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.190
 raincoat non-flying weather 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.529
 the wind is about to start raining so 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.250
 why not understand now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:33.989
 multiply 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:36.440
 and how it looks like we split out 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.440
 polyethylene 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.420
 This is what our rain coat looks like. 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.579
 made of polyethylene is not entirely natural 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.579
 the material is bad for air 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.949
 more natural is considered textiles 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 therefore, we recommend it 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.210
 air hole 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.729
 biladi raincoats 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.799
 different shapes and sizes but the main thing is to 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.869
 your rain coat is best suited 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.860
 the stroller did not let in air and rainfall and 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.860
 protected the child as much as possible 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.860
 Take off Stalin's raincoat as well as dress 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.550
 it's very easy to take it again 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.550
 great and neatly folded 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.680
 choose for this take with you or 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.680
 bags do not bag fold 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.909
 so 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 When buying a rain cover, note the following 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.130
 moments 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.789
 it is desirable to immediately apply 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.479
 heat up 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.410
 he was snug and closed the carriage 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.410
 completely completely 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.160
 protected well from wind and rain and snow 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.670
 Was and from natural materials that is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.230
 from textiles 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.180
 these are the main points that you should 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.680
 take into account when choosing for linen 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.740
 wind and snow
