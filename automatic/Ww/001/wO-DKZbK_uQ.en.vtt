00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone i'm rafa vallejo too 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.750
 known for the play as rafa link vc 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.230
 this is my first video and it 's explaining 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.570
 a fifa 14 trophy that being very 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.029
 simple has spoiled 12 some problems 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.439
 head because it's not exactly like 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.810
 they explain it to you, you have to do it from a 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.149
 determined way and as I've seen in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.310
 other forums and forums of fifa 14 a 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:26.890
 Many people are also finding it 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.019
 complicated to do it and then as 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.300
 looking on youtube I did not see any video 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.640
 explanatory of this trophy then I 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.800
 I decided to do it myself to see if I can 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.859
 help any of you can avenge 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.609
 the trophy is you have emails I already say is 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.629
 a very easy trophy we are going to race 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.120
 we started a career in this case and the 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.519
 I have done already I have started it to me 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.240
 it came out in the player's career too 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.910
 I think you can do it in 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.280
 in manager career I think it comes out 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.900
 same come let's load the race and 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.220
 what happened to me was that if I opened the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.070
 inbox as it says in the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.370
 trophy opened a thousand times and I did not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.770
 the trophy jumped but of course the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.350
 error I think we commit everything is that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.170
 by simulating the games now we will see 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 in the menu 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 of the race when simulating the matches put 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.920
 the trophy tells you that you have to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 you have to simulate a match pair 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.480
 start in the race you low season 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.800
 for example 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.920
 you download calendar 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.650
 here you advance 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 good processors will start in July by 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.720
 there not then it starts to move pictures 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 of matches for league matches by 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 example 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.509
 and clear and will for example to this day 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.220
 I did not want to play two league games 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.310
 after playing with the grenade in this 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.979
 case in real Madrid but of course I 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 simulaba arrived until the 25th in this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.409
 case of August I left as I said in the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.340
 explanation of the trophy I already saw myself to see 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.649
 how do you put my pro that has a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.990
 who has a mail then he gave 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.250
 input tray to open which is the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.379
 triangle in play 3 hello and if in the case 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.930
 that is xbox but there we have a 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.750
 mail something what the trophy tells me 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.090
 is open open the inbox 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.470
 but I do not skip the trophy then like 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.049
 is the way to do it so that it jumps 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.290
 the trophy that we have to be in 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.200
 the central tab not in season as 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.519
 I was before my mistake but 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.739
 be in the central tab and here 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.870
 where it is highlighted in black here is 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.840
 where we have to simulate once 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.120
 we simulate here once simulated those two 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.890
 parties or three that we have advanced a 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.329
 little the season we give here to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.760
 continue and we will realize that 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.060
 in a moment we will come out in the part 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.890
 left above we get a message 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.750
 like we have to run at that moment 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.440
 is when we have to press the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.270
 triangle in play 3 hello and in the case of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.100
 Xbox 360 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.010
 and directly when he tells us that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.680
 there we have a mail directly 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.870
 we press the triangle stops the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 simulation 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 from there it has already come out for me to give 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.290
 the triangle is me now rather than having 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.239
 simulation already automatically stops the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.060
 simulation and it goes straight to the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.240
 input tray and there already jumps the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 trophy 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.920
 I hope I have been able to proxy 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 help some who like me did 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.290
 a thousand times did not come out but I will try 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.270
 put me a comment if you want 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.220
 explain a trophy that's going 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.260
 swallowing a little though in this fifa 14 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.690
 so I'm seeing platinum is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.690
 pretty easy enough until soon
