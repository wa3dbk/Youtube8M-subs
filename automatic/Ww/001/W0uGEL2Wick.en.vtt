 badges 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.579
 I easily breed on the sides 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.879
 with a terrorist attack in the wild and in captivity 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.119
 and this especially applies to one of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.470
 most endangered species 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189
 Sumatran rhinoceros 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.189
 three 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.820

 ohio state vet career off for 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.530
 six years old trying to help awards

 eleven year sled give birth 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 first cub since others 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.840
 rhinos breed in captivity 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.120
 successfully no one expected that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.080
 Sumatran rhino mb get 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 girlfriend 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.810
 and this story began in 1984 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.120
 when scale specialists conceived 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.670
 take decisive steps for 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.670
 save this species 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.510
 on pain sumatran rhinos live high 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.390
 in the mountains in the solitary forests of indonesia and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.050
 Malaysia 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.370
 compared to their African and 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.120
 Indian relatives 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.220
 this is a tiny rhino 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.630
 its height in the shoulder joint is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.350
 about a meter and it weighs only half a ton 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 this is the most ancient 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.130
 of all living rhinos 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.010
 the wool on his skin is icy on the climate 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.040
 his prehistoric ancestors 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 this is the closest living now 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 relative 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630
 woolly rhino 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.490
 extinct beast painted in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.890
 cave man 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.300
 but his pedigree goes back yet 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.119
 further into the depths of time 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 not less than 10 million years ago 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.450
 however eighties twentieth century 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.369
 these rhinos were serious 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.300
 danger 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.120
 of massive increase 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.480
 population size south 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.160
 east asia for rhino has become 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.710
 stay a little space 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230
 to top it all 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.150
 rock Sumatran rhino 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.710
 was aiming at the far east 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.350
 medicine above the slaves of everyone else 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.780
 rhinos 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.240
 and when the Sumatran rhinos are left on 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940
 the will of less than eight hundred scientists decided 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.130
 to breed them in captivity 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.130
 and went to catch the kamsarakan animals 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 it turned out to be easier said than done 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.949
 third relationship rhinos annually 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.869
 almost impassable forest 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.809
 just search each one 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.809
 it took several months 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.449
 I ask you to track down 40 rhinos 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.449
 it took six years 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.639
 At first, most animals were kept in 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.999
 pens near their natural places 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.879
 habitat 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.109
 it seemed that for the same 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.049
 creatures like the sumatran rhino 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.900
 they adapt well to 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.769
 a new way of life but soon things went 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 badly 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.950
 it turned out that there even save 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.069
 the health of these rhinos one after 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.069
 the other half of these centers 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 and no one knew why 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.289
 with those few that were sent for 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.209
 the border 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 there was the same trouble 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.449
 but zincnati zoo specialists and 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.549
 gradually found a clue 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.510
 they found that in the food of these rhinos 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.129
 there was not enough fresh fiber 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.849
 and then for them they began to bring every day 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.620
 by plane from california 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.359
 here alas plants deliver them 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.059
 for two thousand miles it cost almost 140 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.139
 thousand pounds a year 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.299
 when the cincinnati rhinos came in 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.979
 excellent condition could have been 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.979
 get to their development 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.149
 but now the scientists have a new one 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.189
 riddle 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.299
 when courting rhinos between them 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.609
 sometimes there is a lot of confrontation even 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.629
 aggression 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.319
 and when it goes too far 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.039
 I want to enter them in the breeding crew 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.979
 but it turned out that a little rude 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.819
 just do not need to keep 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.669
 females state of arousal 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.379
 unlike all other rhinos in 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.500
 females of Sumatran rhino ovum 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.759
 the ovaries are produced 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.499
 only after mating 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.649
 what for a hermit like this 

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:34.930
 animal makes sense 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.110
 as soon as the scientists understood the chances 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.930
 successful breeding time dramatically 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.470
 increased in May 2005 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.500
 got pregnant before that she had five 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.690
 miscarriages but this time everything looks 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.380
 much more encouraging goals 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.690
 conducts them ultrasound 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.320
 diagnostics checking in what condition 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.820
 health from there their penetration 5 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.939
 strictly limited 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.769
 we have already reached the opportunity limit 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:57.309
 this device and didn't even get to 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:58.189
 bud 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.080
 and this happens planting two whole 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.300
 of the month 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.740
 but liquids not all of these brands will not give up 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.330
 opinion is good she is so closed what 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.509
 must be 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.909
 this is a good sign 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.889
 try to aim on the third line 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:13.719
 stomach 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.489
 if the germ moves and 

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:18.189
 getting addicted 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.139
 we will see him 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.659
 third of its external way of observation 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.280
 puts the device at a different angle 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.749
 hoping to get a better overview 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:29.760
 even though Canada 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280
 we got images of the bud 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.020
 just clean it is therefore difficult to understand 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.580
 what exactly is this part of today 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.250
 bud moves actively opponents in 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.669
 recent times 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.669
 cm 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.449
 time is already in the thirteenth place 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.699
 pregnancy which is a miscalculation machine 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.610
 should last 17 months then understand 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.919
 that was 5 go out further I can't vouch she 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.990
 it seems that everything is very good 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.449
 it took another four months a day and soon 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.960
 must meet the expectations of scientists 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.280
 September 12, 2001 to 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.280
 in the evening she does not find a place for herself 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.860
 I don't have a day early 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.860
 in the morning her homeland begins 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.750
 there 11 23 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.819
 awards in different years 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.819
 at the same time for themselves 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.299
 for 112 years is the first Sumatran rhino 

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.299
 born in captivity 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.349
 dollars this small for its solid weight 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.099
 at 32 kilograms was the result of a difficult 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.099
 work lasting over July 15 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.500
 it was a long way but maybe this event 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.169
 talks about learning the same thing 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.029
 the little and the ancients of all living on time 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.509
 up to two months 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.719
 and
