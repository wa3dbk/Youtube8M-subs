and being attracted to the yellow so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.170 
and being attracted to the yellow so
they<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> plaster<00:00:44.850> toward<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
they go to the plaster toward the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
they go to the plaster toward the
plastic<00:00:45.570> instead<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.870> onto<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> plant<00:00:46.530> okay

particularly one called yellow nutsedge
the<00:01:01.949> way<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> grows<00:01:02.460> comes<00:01:03.210> out<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> ground

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the way it grows comes out of the ground

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.210 
the way it grows comes out of the ground
with<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> sharp<00:01:04.170> point<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> punch<00:01:04.979> right

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
with a sharp point it can punch right

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.640 
with a sharp point it can punch right
through<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> plastic<00:01:05.729> mulch<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
through the plastic mulch and in you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.950 
through the plastic mulch and in you
might<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.159> reduction<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.720> weed

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
might get some reduction of of weed

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
might get some reduction of of weed
populations<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:11.880> of
