00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.100
 low 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.620
 Well then here after the lion does not 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.630
 with the visit of Leonel Puebla comes from 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.580
 lose with the monterrey of local 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.960
 and the lion comes from losing with the chivas 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.700
 but I think lion is going to get the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
 result 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.450
 in the morelia trinity stoneware this is going to 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.510
 be good but I think the morelia 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.210
 will win now yes local although the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.500
 tigers has won him the blue cross in the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.440
 process the america I think it's going to be 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.700
 a draw but I 'm going to put it in 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 America 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.440
 in the holy jaguars x jaguars I do not know 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.330
 which matches you have not won 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.550
 local saints so I want sweet with the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.680
 local also let's go with the local 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.630
 monterrey against querétaro although that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.810
 match that can be equal surprise and 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.700
 the querétaro leezza leezza eggs no 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.390
 in san luis-pachuca I think it's a 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.250
 tie already sung 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.260
 in toluca and atlante which what comes 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.909
 losing to much of Jaguars 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.300
 look at losing in houses and then 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.270
 with the local toluca in the chivas pumas 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.890
 in the other classic I think that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.929
 I also did that but it can be a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.119
 draw the two come good guys already 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.640
 motive but I do not think so, why not 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.480
 I think it does a lot to pumas is that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.760
 I think it's going to be a draw 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.340
 In the Manchester City Dársena visited her 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.290
 in the local mallorca against 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.900
 Valencians and with the valence 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.220
 Udinese and Milan tie the schalke and the 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.090
 bayern wins the visit the psv beats him the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.010
 and honor and beats the lion and the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.460
 tijuana rematch of the class I think 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.030
 it's going to be a draw 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.619
 in the tecos and necaxa give necaxa the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.979
 liverpool and the manchester i think it's 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.979
 a tie 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.160
 in the east and the real society that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.300
 I believe that the real society wins 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.710
 parma fiorentina I'm going to the fiore the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.730
 bayer leverkusen against borussia 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:30.010
 m'gladbach enjoy winning the visit and the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.010
 Bordeaux draw with Ajax I 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.220
 from the mayor 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.959
 p 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.379
 here they have the goal in 140 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.319
 A Morelia-Tigers in Morelia comes two 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.709
 lost matches 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.720
 and in tigers, he played very well against 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.780
 blue cross so let's go same throw 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.130
 in the america I do not think it was going to be 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 tie but you know that I 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.580
 in jaguars saints the jaguars hit him 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.670
 to toluca but not why 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.770
 I do not think I can win there in saints 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.120
 the monterrey is because he said against 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.120
 Querétaro the Queretano brings nothing 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.750
 the game this is the leader he beat the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.650
 atlante of visit and the back could not with 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.299
 the querétaro 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980
 so I think that even there is a 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.400
 tie 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.680
 is to visit this place or in part and then 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.659
 have a tie 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.240
 in san luis-pachuca I also think that 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.270
 it's a draw since he has sung 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.830
 in toluca ahead I believe that the plant 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.520
 it's going to be a good match to toluca but 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.000
 I do not think a cost will win it so with 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.980
 the toluca 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.980
 chivas the other classic 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.050
 I think it will also be a draw 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.400
 well he is already motivated that he won 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.150
 the lion in his house and the cougar knows 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.280
 lost with san luis 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.310
 and I think it's a draw or a local 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.290
 chivas in liverpool and manchester 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.570
 that because Manchester wins 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.020
 the manchester city ​​and the arsenal already for 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.940
 that Manchester wins Betis and the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.620
 Spanish 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.699
 then a part also here 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.000
 and the Udinese tell me not to say with the 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.000
 local 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.060
 remember they are here in the 140's 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.860
 winner 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.100
 It would be everything and see you in the next 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.100
 video
