00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 and winning is the only thing that goes through the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 of the players of the national team 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.440
 Mexican when they have to face us like that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
 explained Alberto García aspe who 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.910
 as a member of the tricolor he faced 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 on 14 occasions to the northern neighbor 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 many were the experiences he lived 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 among Americans however the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.420
 now sports vice president of the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.460
 Cougars said that regardless of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 circumstances before those of the 'bars and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.580
 the stars' always goes in the middle 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
 the pride 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.490
 if it's totally because for many 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.130
 situations is not everything we all 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 represents they feel more in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.150
 many things and it's normal but football 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 I've always grown more then what 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.250
 you have to ratify match game and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.500
 well I think it has been showing 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.780
 whenever you win against the USA 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.580
 although many people say that it is a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.250
 plurality obligation you know that the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.980
 matches are no longer so easy and less 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.140
 before and against rivals with players 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.750
 important things that the US has many times 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 when in Europe also several of them 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.159
 mexico too but but if they are from 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.229
 Total pride is not like a classic 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.090
 when you play but I think that here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.580
 be and represent your country with the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.830
 green shirt are of greater 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 responsibility I believe that if you live 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.010
 as for like a classic you see it 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.780
 all week by also by the press 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.760
 for everything that is being said for everything 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 what is being handled and because you know 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.590
 which is a match that you can not miss 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 what you have to earn as I say 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 as a classic to the best you can 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
 to play 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 league but here to be at the selection level 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.400
 it becomes sometimes if it is in a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.710
 obligation or to the player there that what 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.690
 you have to know how to handle perfectly and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.060
 that all he has to do is play 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.060
 death and get the result 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.760
 likewise garcía aspe that matters for 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 long the captain's badge 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.909
 tri spoke about the work that the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.190
 maza rodríguez about it 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.320
 if he chose the hand I know a lot 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.960
 mass as a person I do not know more as 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 player no more than having seen it but if 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.340
 Chopo chooses it for something 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.930
 and the truth is that he is a player who has 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.770
 proven best you initially 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.330
 Spending was criticized and what good did it show 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 going to Europe he is a great player 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.200
 and that done things very well and if 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.200
 choose chepo will be for something 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.390
 with images of gerardo flowers reported 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.390
