00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.800
 a little trouble tonight 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.569
 then you will arrive on this page 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.970
 you do free download of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.940
 java accepted to start the download 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.750
 free I will not get it to you 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.489
 to do this game is already 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 once they feel download 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.340
 you install it once it will be 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 installed a web page will open 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.489
 especially do not farm and I have 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.739
 made the mistake of closing it you do not 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.879
 not affirmed and there will be written 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.290
 check my java version you click 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.230
 on check the version and it comes 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.599
 firas there is an error 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.659
 less young one for example if I do 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.480
 check my version 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:48.019
 I will have some errors but it's not 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.000
 serious it works anyway it works 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.400
 still my minecraft 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.680
 so do not worry about the mistake 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 then once java is installed 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 correctly you'll have it all so 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.549
 programs normally somewhere 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.950
 here is java there will be configure jar to 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.980
 about javelin and fangs looking for 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.190
 So update that's up to you 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.170
 finally it's in your pc now 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.519
 then you will double-click on the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.870
 launcher executed then he will tell you 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.420
 that there is an update available 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.340
 you can do update 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.970
 if I do that it led me to the page of 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.500
 downloading 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.109
 that's it and we'll have to get the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.599
 no it's not doing it because 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.540
 I like this version so I 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.310
 clicked executed you can do it 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.500
 up to date if you want and I'm doing ok and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.030
 it works anyway but hey we can 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.480
 not saved so there you put a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.380
 profile name 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.989
 here is the default profile you 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.120
 can choose a version me I you 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.430
 advise 1.01 I'm laughing I you 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.430
 advise the 1.7 points 10 because 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.900
 that's where there is the most people 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.780
 and then the 1.8 I have not yet 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.510
 tried fish but you can put 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.010
 aims the head version we will leave 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.040
 burst versions for this example 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.720
 you do that and profile you do 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.250
 playes wait for it to start and there 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.169
 I made a small ellipses because 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.590
 see he downloaded minecraft until 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.139
 bout so hands are you saw my 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.490
 com stasia it's not very serious so a 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:32.630
 little ellipses and we end up after 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 So here we go again after the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.620

 he's the swimmer who does that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.960

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.009

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.430

 it's a virus and geof it's a species 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.779
 2.2 is cache cache and we can say 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.879
 so you open here you will point 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:54.449
 minecraft you open it and there you have 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.819
