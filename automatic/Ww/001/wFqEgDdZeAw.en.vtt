00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 this is my first video I hope you like it 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 jejeje xd I searched and searched for videos of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.670
 grand theft auto 5 with the story but 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.410
 almost everyone said the same and good 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.330
 I dedicated myself to researching 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 account information images and everything 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 related to that game without more than 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 clarify let's start with the information the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.850
 launch of this 5 will be more 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 rugged of what might seem to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 simple view according to oxman the sandbox of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 rockstar will have to face neither more nor 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 less than four other games that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 they plan to kill themselves to take over the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.910
 throne of the genre you're sure 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.469
 thinking about a certain title of the 2012 a-3 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 the four games that they plan to kill 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.620
 the launch of grand theft auto 5 are 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 sleeping dogs saints row 4 need for 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 speed most wanted to that is also a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.710
 sandbox and like no whats box whose demo what 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 became the king of the 3rd lack of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 trailer of a certain title awaited very much 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 that goes on in the saints and already 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 we warned in his day that the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.789
 confrontation watts dock ups sect 5 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 it was going to be more spectacular than 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.659
 it looked like the conceptual trailer and the demo 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.549
 of the ubisoft game 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.210
 they amazed those present at the e3 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.759
 2012 the release of a version of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.369
 grand theft auto 5 for ps vita is every 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.590
 more than likely as reported 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.329
 product reviews are and is leading 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.310
 conducted a survey asking the 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.350
 participants that explain their interest 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 towards possible titles for his new 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 portable one of the chosen ones is a 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.039
 delivery of grand theft auto 'at a price 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.340
 reduced if you buy the port for ps3 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.259
 of the next installment of the sony sandbox 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.969
 could repeat the same performance as 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.819
 made with ubisoft for the saga 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.799
 assassin's believe 3 on the same day 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.079
 game launch will also come out to 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.000
 the sale liberation a spin-off for 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.099
 playstation vita that you can take 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 Reduced price if you buy it in a 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.299
 of pack with his big brother and if 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.369
 rockstar is interested in doing what 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.069
 same with a secondary game of grand 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.020
 theft auto 5 this information the 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.879
 I found a night that was fine 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.489
 traumatized by searching and looking for something 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.649
 grand theft auto 5x of good as 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.929
 we can see above the image you see a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.200
 chub of the blockbuster company and what 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.599
 they are moving to the xbox platform 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 you can see the price of the game and what 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.580
 more important the departure date that 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.010
 says it's October 26 , 2012 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.290
 I clarify I do not say that the date is real 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 but in 2011 I went to ask 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.360
 when I went to the playstation vita and I 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.519
 they said that on February 22 , 2012 and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.280
 I did not believe them because in many forums 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.709
 they said he was leaving by the end of 2011 I 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 Console surprise came 22 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.840
 February 2012 xd and again I clarify no 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.510
 I say it's the official departure date 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.120
 below a gameplay that I found 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.370
 I recently saw this video a little bit real 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.650
 because you see the same faint tone 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.079
 I think it says well x good looks 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.870
 almost equal to the official video of grand 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.209
 theft auto 5 and as you know the fans of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.549
 grand theft auto 'rock star game when 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.380
 pulls out trailers of your games or good of 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.049
 the trailers that I have seen that are 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.930
 Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Grand Theft 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.150
 auto ' 3 and grand theft auto 4 is the same 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.489
 graphic engine of the trailer and the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010
 video game like I did not know what to say in 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.230
 this part x of clarification that I did not say the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.980
 rumors of cars because many 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.709
 they talked about 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.959
 the supposed child who got the copy 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.299
 before the departure date because it is already 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.610
 clarified that it is false and apart I wonder 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.920
 who would sell by ebay the grand theft 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.319
 car 5 knowing that it is a game that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.510
 still does not come out or a conclusion of mine is 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.280
 that rockstar has lost a copy 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.410
 of his game and that a guy has 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.049
 found and sold it by ebay for me 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.180
 that is false as we can see the water is 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.280
 see in a certain point real eye too 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.069
 I want to clarify that I am not saying that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.160
 the video is real too I did not record it 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.410
 from my pc xd the video came so I do not know why 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.319
 what is seen in some parts the bar 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.060
 tasks of windows 7 xp and as in everything 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.859
 videogame in the betas are seen 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.430
 numbers and letters on the left 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.709
 Video not my left xd xd xd 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.049
 you can also see the character that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.090
 is in a swat or police suit 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.040
 as they are called in the video we can see 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.289
 some parts of the city but I do not know 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.690
 it looks like the saints but as he said 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.820
 rockstar the city will be bigger than 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.190
 the one of san andreas and it can be another 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.410
 part of the game and well that has been all 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.060
