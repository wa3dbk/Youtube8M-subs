 and well hi friends is that more 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.520
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.920
 new video for episode 4 of my 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.509
 series buying resale for dummies so 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 here's last week there was 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.570
 no episode simply because there he 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.520
 there was there totti necessarily who says 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 dippach opening tools and that is for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.340
 that they had no episode of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 this series there but do not worry 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
 far from being over since my goal 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 it's to help you make the purchase 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.850
 resale by giving you my advice that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.830
 I hope to help you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 just passing there for the four 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.000
 oars is rodrigues rodriguez that makes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.720
 three four months that are stuck in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.519
 my exchange pile 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.659
 I can not do anything like that 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.890
 already contacted there is they tell me 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.420
 to wait for the two days after they 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.739
 say it's good finally we're going 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 not to argue about it does not matter 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.830
 I'm talking place after but it was 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.089
 it's just for those who have asked me 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.080
 question serves to put the gases are 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.970
 blocked I can not do anything 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.460
 so here is today episode 4 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.130
 friends so episode 4 we'll say 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 that it is rather specialized for 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 players who do not have a lot of credit 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.810
 that's why I did not select 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 badly of players because I was asked 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 to make a list etc 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 so here I selected players 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 who leave very very well for the purchase 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.659
 resale 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.520
 so I'm going to give you a few 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.590
 techniques must be used on these players 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.090
 there so be for the first technique 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.470
 you use the leaked technique 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 millionaire so we have the technique that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.560
 everyone knows you are you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 buy a player you put them more 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.300
 dear we'll say you buy a bar at 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.270
 1700 you put at 2700 it's not 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 inevitably good customers like that 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.480
 and you try to restart it on 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.770
 maximum of times must restart each 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.300
 every hour, it is necessary to 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.130
 at some point your see not go away and 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.330
 you are going to make credits or so 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030
 so that's the first 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.840
 technique or so the second technique 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 so during this time I do a little 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.230
 pass the players so there you 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.190
 were able by hal that pulled Goddyn stung I 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.870
 do not have everything I wanted to say you have 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.640
 eyes to look small 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.470
 breaks like that you'll see that one day 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.840
 I advise you friends so the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.220
 second technique this is the tech have 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 more so it's a technique that have to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.100
 to say that our skates are going to say to ride 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.390
 we'll say that like that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.800
 so what is that what 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 it's this technique so it has the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.110
 technique is to always buy 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.459
 the same players the same type of player 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.769
 it's cheap players between lille 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.299
 and 5000 credit so it's technical 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.799
 is actually buying these players 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:24.720
 there and resell them by applying a 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.590
 classic gold contract plus a style this 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.220
 possible to buy directly 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.490
 the excellent one style which is a lot 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.490
 and after you go to 1500 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.820
 profit credit over price 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.470
 purchase 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.610
 I'll explain if now you buy 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.420
 for example we will take a contract or 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.750
 because I'm above 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 they were buying want hao or to say 1500 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.390
 crisis it's not I do not know I 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.660
 do not know his loan now it's 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.130
 a single example 5500 creed so you 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.450
 buy this price there the bastide 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.480
 there is nothing so we will say that you 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.370
 put a classic gold contract that costs 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.620
 we are going to say 200 credit so that's the price 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.840
 purchase 1700 credit plus one more style 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.250
 we'll say something about the pillar defenders 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.560
 or sentinel month just like that where that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.970
 will mean that you have 500 for 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.200
 consumables so that makes you have 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 bought let's say your contract august 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.810
 2000 credit then you will calculate 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.850
 the tax there is that is 5% of course 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.010
 you will add more 1500 to this price 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.190
 so we'll say we'll put our 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.080
 trahot corner around 3700 3800 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.760
 and you will see that he is going to leave in 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.290
 the header not necessarily in the five 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.270
 minutes away from there he's going to leave in 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 some reminders well not to be 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.860
 no longer impatient in front of all these 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.970
 players even though it's a quality but 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.709
 must be patient must not be 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.269
 want his share that a suite must 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.140
 still some time after 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.459
 do not forget that there is a bit of luck 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.260
 in the resale purchase repeats it often 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.250
 because that's the case so here you are 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.080
 have understood the technique 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.790
 just buy players from this 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.400
 type there is a player that I put you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.540
 the tooth in the list a little list 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.910
 with da bpm beyond the bundesliga of the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.070
 seria and the bbva so here I am you 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.160
 heat up, I'll give you this list 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.360
 behind my little background in pictures as 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.560
 you can see all this for all 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.970
 those who ask me lists etc 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.590
 after maybe I 'll make lists 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.640
 on twitter also but that's for the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.989
 not bad who asked me in the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.519
 next episode just to do that 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.260
 so here I propose you directly 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.580
 that's really the technique of 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.810
 base to start buying resale for 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.250
 those who do not have a lot of credit 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.930
 it's the millionaire technique 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.370
 the technique the tech before more 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.419
 so of course I will put the link of the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.040
 video paws in description 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.450
 regarding this technique the art that 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.090
 those who have more questions at this 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.650
 about it it's a very technical 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.520
 easy and that works very well for 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.260
 players who do not have a lot of 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.850
 credit and I advise you to do these 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.710
 techniques there to have a good base 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.870
 credit to be able to then make a 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.700
 technique that I will talk about in the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.500
 next episode most definitely a 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.180
 technique that works even better 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.860
 sure plus you have credit to my shots that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.910
 you are going to make a profit has yielded my 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.920
 class and not understood 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.150
 and understand so of course I you 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.650
 really advise to buy these players 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.960
 there finally to make the purchase resale 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.340
 with the players that I propose to you 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.870
 in this little list it's like 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.410
 it's going to be players who are there 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.450
 Popular 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.040
 they are sought after in the market for 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.330
 make teams etc etc hours that 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.770
 people buy because that I 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.240
 you advise them so here I am you 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.470
 advise to do latter case either 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.260
 the technique makes millionaire 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.940
 on these players it's fine 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.770
 market do not worry just have to 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.480
 to raise to a maximum of times each 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.220
 euro as much as possible and you will see 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.420
 that it 's really going to work it makes us 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.620
 his suite until you have a 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.390
 good credit base we what is that 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.920
 I call a good credit base a 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.900
 bump to a good credit base sorry 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.250
 for me it's about 200 250 miles 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.440
 credit for really good power 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.000
 start the top technique that 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.740
 of course will bring you more money 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.750
 but what I really wanted 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.760
 once say it's trying to fill 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.470
 his stack of 30 elements is better to have 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.270
 thirty players not very expensive in the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.010
 stack that to have five a little more 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.690
 expensive in the pile because you're going 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.220
 sell inevitably less players less 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.480
 quickly if you have five that if 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.250
 you have 36 movement 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.820
 mathematics guys that's just that at 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.380
 understand 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.550
 so I would definitely suggest up 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.230
 there who have a hundred thousand credit they want 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.430
 directly made related keyboard finally 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.600
 I do not want to dwell on this subject 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.670
 I'll talk about it in the next video 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.290
 but we must not rush into the 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.040
 head planes if you're not telling me 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.480
 insiders we can say that like that 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.470
 correctly because after that if not you 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.910
 go do anything you go 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.620
 lose credit so better 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.300
 expect to have a good foundation of 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.890
 credit as said and then you will see 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.320
 after that it'll be pretty easy 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.180
 just it's going to be it's going to be very 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.400
 simple and then so here I hope that 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.510
 this technique is going to help you to 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.590
 those who do not have a lot of credit 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.820
 because after I know she has who have
