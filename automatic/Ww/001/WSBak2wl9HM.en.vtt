00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so rightfully so red was like the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
so rightfully so red was like the
perfect<00:01:48.420> weapon<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.649> DMR<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.399> close

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
perfect weapon the DMR is really close

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
perfect weapon the DMR is really close
because<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:51.060> they've<00:01:51.240> released<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.750> updated

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because now they've released in updated

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
because now they've released in updated
DMR<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.220> doesn't<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> plastic<00:01:53.820> ring

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
DMR that doesn't have the plastic ring

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240 
DMR that doesn't have the plastic ring
there<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> front<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> figures<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there in the front so the figures can

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920 
there in the front so the figures can
hold<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.700> easier<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> DMR<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
hold that much easier but the DMR is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.740 
hold that much easier but the DMR is
like<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> perfect<00:01:59.030> perfectly<00:02:00.030> held<00:02:00.299> weapon<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
like the perfect perfectly held weapon I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.230 
like the perfect perfectly held weapon I
mean<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.020> fits<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:02.430> comes<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
mean it just fits he also comes with a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.749 
mean it just fits he also comes with a
farrago<00:02:03.750> nade<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.710> his<00:02:04.979> butt<00:02:05.369> peg

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
farrago nade which I put on his butt peg

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.340 
farrago nade which I put on his butt peg
one<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> always<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.930> putting<00:02:07.259> my

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
one of them I always like putting my

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.529 
one of them I always like putting my
grenades<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> left<00:02:08.009> side<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:09.420> know

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
grenades on the left side I don't know

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
grenades on the left side I don't know
why<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.080> guess<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.679> assumed<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> ammo<00:02:11.760> clips

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
why I guess I assumed the ammo clips

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
why I guess I assumed the ammo clips
will<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> right<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.379> know

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

now this is actually one of the first
Spartans<00:02:54.810> actually<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.739> first

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010

out<00:03:00.510> they<00:03:00.660> had<00:03:00.690> different<00:03:01.350> armor<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
out they had different armor on the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.320 
out they had different armor on the

shoulders and the chest in the helmet

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.990 
shoulders and the chest in the helmet
they<00:03:03.390> were<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.540> different<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:05.000> obviously

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.979 
don't I think they do but all the joints
work<00:03:43.980> pretty<00:03:44.190> well<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.640> figure<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:45.450> really

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
work pretty well in this figure a really

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.960 
work pretty well in this figure a really
great<00:03:46.140> thing<00:03:46.350> about<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.859> Halo<00:03:47.220> Reach<00:03:47.340> line<00:03:47.760> is

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
great thing about the Halo Reach line is

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.280 
great thing about the Halo Reach line is
that<00:03:48.120> when<00:03:48.359> you<00:03:48.450> get<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.720> figures<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.019> open

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that when you get the figures you open

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.319 
that when you get the figures you open
them<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.859> joints<00:03:50.040> work<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:51.209> might

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
them up all the joints work you might

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.060
