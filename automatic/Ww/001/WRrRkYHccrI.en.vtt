00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
pay the ten or fifteen percent based on

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.250 
pay the ten or fifteen percent based on
that<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.000> depends<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.540> how<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.780> price

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
that so just depends on how you price

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.120 
that so just depends on how you price
your<00:03:32.500> products<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.790> how<00:03:34.209> much<00:03:34.390> Commission

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
your products and how much Commission

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.890 
your products and how much Commission
percentages<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.670> are<00:03:37.000> going<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.510> pay<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.690> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
percentages you are going to pay to the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.310 
percentages you are going to pay to the
location<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.590> that's<00:03:39.190> how<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.430> base<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.670> on

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
location and that's how I base it on

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.170 
location and that's how I base it on
percentages<00:03:41.320> basic<00:03:41.980> percentages<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
percentages basic percentages and that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.780 
percentages basic percentages and that
is<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.359> normal<00:03:43.750> percentage<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.920> pay<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.130> location

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
is a normal percentage to pay a location

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.449 
is a normal percentage to pay a location
so<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.590> end<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.890> question<00:03:48.430> number

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
so that is the end of question number

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.580 
so that is the end of question number
two<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> answer<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:50.019> question<00:03:50.380> number

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
two and the answer to question number

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.830 
two and the answer to question number
two<00:03:50.769> which<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.640> what<00:03:51.940> was<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.299> normal<00:03:52.660> amount

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
two which is what was the normal amount

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.459 
two which is what was the normal amount
of<00:03:52.989> Commission's<00:03:53.470> paid<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.890> locations
