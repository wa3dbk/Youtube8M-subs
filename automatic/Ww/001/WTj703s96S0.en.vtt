hey<00:00:13.299> I'm<00:00:13.570> known<00:00:13.750> from<00:00:13.990> hardware<00:00:14.350> heaven<00:00:14.680> and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
hey I'm known from hardware heaven and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.380 
hey I'm known from hardware heaven and
today<00:00:15.039> we<00:00:15.100> do<00:00:15.340> a<00:00:15.369> review<00:00:15.760> of<00:00:15.879> the<00:00:15.969> sapphire

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
today we do a review of the sapphire

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.230 
today we do a review of the sapphire
Edge<00:00:16.539> HD<00:00:16.840> for<00:00:17.440> now<00:00:18.039> this<00:00:18.160> is<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.340> mini<00:00:18.580> PC<00:00:19.030> which

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
Edge HD for now this is a mini PC which

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.850 
Edge HD for now this is a mini PC which
could<00:00:19.480> replace<00:00:19.600> traditional<00:00:20.320> family<00:00:20.680> and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
could replace traditional family and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.070 
could replace traditional family and
business<00:00:21.220> desktops<00:00:21.790> being<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.540> new<00:00:22.690> fraction

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
business desktops being a new fraction

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.720 
business desktops being a new fraction
of<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.290> size<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.740> using<00:00:23.980> hardly<00:00:24.340> any<00:00:24.460> power

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
of the size and using hardly any power

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.550 
of the size and using hardly any power
so<00:00:25.480> I'm<00:00:25.750> going<00:00:25.870> to<00:00:25.930> start<00:00:26.080> by<00:00:26.170> taking<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.530> the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
so I'm going to start by taking for the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.520 
so I'm going to start by taking for the
cran<00:00:26.770> box<00:00:27.780> looking<00:00:28.780> in<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.960> box<00:00:29.170> of<00:00:29.410> the

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
cran box looking in the box of the

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.800 
cran box looking in the box of the
sapphire<00:00:29.950> Edge<00:00:30.130> HD<00:00:30.490> 4<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.240> can<00:00:31.360> see<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:31.690> how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
sapphire Edge HD 4 you can see just how

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.630 
sapphire Edge HD 4 you can see just how
small<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.200> system<00:00:32.529> actually<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:33.070> sniff<00:00:33.399> I<00:00:33.489> use

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
small the system actually it sniff I use

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.910 
small the system actually it sniff I use
my<00:00:33.789> hands<00:00:34.030> in<00:00:34.239> comparison<00:00:34.899> I've<00:00:35.440> actually<00:00:35.620> had

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
my hands in comparison I've actually had

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.939 
my hands in comparison I've actually had
external<00:00:36.250> hard<00:00:36.579> drives<00:00:36.789> coming<00:00:36.999> bigger<00:00:37.239> boxes

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
external hard drives coming bigger boxes

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.529 
external hard drives coming bigger boxes
so<00:00:38.949> the<00:00:39.159> system<00:00:39.519> has<00:00:39.550> an<00:00:39.760> Intel<00:00:40.120> Celeron

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
so the system has an Intel Celeron

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.319 
so the system has an Intel Celeron
8<00:00:40.749> 4<00:00:40.960> 7<00:00:41.260> processor<00:00:41.890> it's<00:00:42.309> got<00:00:42.489> 4<00:00:42.730> gigabytes<00:00:43.179> of

ddr3 memory and a 320 gigabytes 2.5 inch
hard<00:00:47.140> drive<00:00:47.409> it<00:00:47.890> also<00:00:48.069> supports<00:00:48.399> 1080p

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
hard drive it also supports 1080p

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.479 
hard drive it also supports 1080p
content<00:00:49.629> now<00:00:50.469> this<00:00:50.649> system<00:00:50.979> doesn't<00:00:51.219> already

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
content now this system doesn't already

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.160 
content now this system doesn't already
come<00:00:51.819> with<00:00:51.999> an<00:00:52.059> operating<00:00:52.539> system<00:00:52.690> installed

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
come with an operating system installed

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.349 
come with an operating system installed
so<00:00:53.469> you<00:00:53.499> will<00:00:53.679> have<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.920> install<00:00:54.190> one<00:00:54.370> fast<00:00:54.640> in

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
so you will have to install one fast in

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.079 
so you will have to install one fast in
the<00:00:55.569> box<00:00:55.749> you<00:00:56.019> get<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.229> 65<00:00:56.920> watt<00:00:57.129> AC<00:00:57.309> adapter

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
the box you get a 65 watt AC adapter

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.750 
the box you get a 65 watt AC adapter
amounts<00:00:58.659> I<00:00:58.749> hold<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.079> system<00:00:59.409> upright<00:00:59.800> HDMI

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
amounts I hold the system upright HDMI

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.209 
amounts I hold the system upright HDMI
