off the copter may be inspired by the
inspire<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.329> well<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.829> 360<00:03:19.829> camera

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510

movement around the bottom of the drone

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.220 
movement around the bottom of the drone
with<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:24.030> retracts<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.720> there<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.019> well<00:03:25.200> so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
with with retracts on there as well so

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.319 
with with retracts on there as well so
we<00:03:25.560> don't<00:03:25.739> film<00:03:26.340> any<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> phantom<00:03:27.120> legs

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
we don't film any of the phantom legs

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.270 
we don't film any of the phantom legs
anymore<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.590> would<00:03:28.739> be<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:29.010> nice

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
anymore so that would be really nice

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.479 
anymore so that would be really nice

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
have been asking for that in the past

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.720 
have been asking for that in the past
year<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:37.859> does<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.340> Phantom

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
year so that you know does the Phantom

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.150 
year so that you know does the Phantom
do<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> follow<00:03:39.269> me<00:03:39.510> function<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.709> typically

do the follow me function not typically

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.940 
do the follow me function not typically
no<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.640> does<00:03:41.819> not<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.500> we're<00:03:43.500> not<00:03:43.620> we're<00:03:43.920> not

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
no it does not so we're not we're not

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.920 
no it does not so we're not we're not

going to get into that but modular

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.250 
going to get into that but modular
camera<00:03:46.290> design<00:03:46.620> would<00:03:46.829> be<00:03:47.010> great<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.639> we<00:03:47.970> had

want to show a client you can load that

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.129 
want to show a client you can load that
into<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.639> software<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.300> then<00:05:30.779> you<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:30.990> go

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
into the software and then you can go

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.200 
into the software and then you can go
out<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.439> the<00:05:31.560> property<00:05:31.740> location<00:05:32.370> fly<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
out to the property location fly the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.600 
out to the property location fly the
drone<00:05:33.599> around<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.110> exactly<00:05:35.069> where<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.460> would

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
drone around it exactly where it would

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.360 
drone around it exactly where it would
be<00:05:35.909> in<00:05:36.120> position<00:05:37.050> with<00:05:37.259> the<00:05:37.289> latitude<00:05:38.250> and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
be in position with the latitude and

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.879 
be in position with the latitude and
longitude<00:05:38.879> so<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:39.810> can<00:05:40.020> get<00:05:40.110> like<00:05:40.289> a<00:05:40.349> preview

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889
