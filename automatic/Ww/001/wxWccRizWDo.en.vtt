here<00:00:08.069> he's<00:00:08.639> having<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.000> low-voltage<00:00:09.360> problem

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
here he's having a low-voltage problem

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.650 
here he's having a low-voltage problem
every<00:00:10.230> time<00:00:10.260> his<00:00:10.650> compressors<00:00:11.250> come<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.910> he's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
every time his compressors come on he's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.810 
every time his compressors come on he's
running<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.139> via<00:00:13.530> compressors<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.519> he's<00:00:14.639> got

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
running for via compressors and he's got

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090 
running for via compressors and he's got

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
problem that we have and in our next

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.939 
problem that we have and in our next
episode<00:00:52.230> we'll<00:00:52.680> show<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> after<00:00:53.460> results

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
episode we'll show you the after results

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.250 
episode we'll show you the after results
how<00:00:55.949> much<00:00:56.100> better<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 

so<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.800> running<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.160> voltage<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.640> an

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so you're running good voltage in an

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.859 
so you're running good voltage in an
idol<00:01:03.059> nothing<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:06.440> then<00:01:07.440> when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> kick<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> on

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
idol nothing on then when you kick it on

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.030 
idol nothing on then when you kick it on
you<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.050> drop<00:01:10.290> love<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.800> after<00:01:10.950> about

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you see a drop love it and after about

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
you see a drop love it and after about
30<00:01:11.310> seconds<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.790> drops<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.390> nine<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
30 seconds it drops down about nine to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350 
30 seconds it drops down about nine to
ten<00:01:12.840> volts<00:01:13.550> which<00:01:14.550> means<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> gotta<00:01:15.060> run<00:01:15.210> your

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
ten volts which means you gotta run your

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
ten volts which means you gotta run your
rpms<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.619> 1500<00:01:17.340> 1800<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
rpms up to about 1500 1800 to get the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
rpms up to about 1500 1800 to get the
voltage<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.660> up<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.190> see<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
voltage back up as you can see the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.710 
voltage back up as you can see the
needle<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> pointing<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> left

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
needle is kind of pointing to the left

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.790 
needle is kind of pointing to the left
and<00:01:22.280> air<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.400> truck<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:24.320> yeah<00:01:25.320> bring<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.619> up

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.490 

this<00:01:30.580> goes<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:30.970> for<00:01:31.050> three<00:01:32.050> minutes<00:01:32.230> roughly

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.330 

so<00:01:44.340> anyhoo<00:01:44.900> we<00:01:45.900> just<00:01:46.080> got<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.260> single<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.250> my

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
so anyhoo we just got a single off to my

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
so anyhoo we just got a single off to my
yellow<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.210> we're<00:01:48.360> gonna<00:01:48.420> replace

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
yellow top in here we're gonna replace

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
yellow top in here we're gonna replace
that<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.950> third<00:01:50.190> episode<00:01:50.370> we're<00:01:50.940> gonna

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that the third episode we're gonna

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320 
that the third episode we're gonna
upgrade<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> 14<00:01:52.680> volt<00:01:52.920> system<00:01:53.340> show<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
upgrade to a 14 volt system show you the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.310 
upgrade to a 14 volt system show you the
difference<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.660> makes<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.200> these

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
difference that makes on these

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.070 
difference that makes on these
compressors<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.600> anyway<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> should<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.050> a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
compressors but anyway it should be a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.560 
compressors but anyway it should be a
should<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.250> pretty<00:01:59.640> big<00:01:59.820> improvement<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
should be a pretty big improvement so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.010 
should be a pretty big improvement so
stay<00:02:00.810> tuned<00:02:01.020> thanks<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.680> watching
