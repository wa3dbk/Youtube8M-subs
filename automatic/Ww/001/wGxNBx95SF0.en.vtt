00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello guitar good afternoon and I am the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.480
 teacher resÃ©ndiz in this video we are going to 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.119
 make an explanation of how to remove and 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.210
 putting a baby rope is sometimes 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.369
 necessary to do it to do some 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.220
 tuning adjustment some adjustment with the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.040
 peg or you can also help us for 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.700
 see how to change it by a new rope 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.120
 this is a three-quarter violin and we're going to 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.030
 do 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.770
 a good rope change the first thing that 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.050
 we have to do if we want to withdraw 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.760
 a violin string is to know what is 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.860
 which then we are going to remove because 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 right now all the strings have a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.589
 tension not then if we remove the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.960
 attention of all the strings good 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.030
 we will bring more problems we will 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.079
 throw the bridge let's make a series 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.689
 of things that they avoid we do not need 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.240
 in this case we are going to remove the rope from 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.380
 network the first thing they have to do is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 loosen it with the pin 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.030
 in this way the rope is removed as 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.360
 you will see it is not very simple some parts 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.620
 important of the rope is this drum 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.930
 He cited this drum 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.440
 in what serves to hold on the side 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.000
 of the tuner in the string strings 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 and on this side we have a threading of 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.370
 fabric that is the one that helps to have this 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.680
 greater fixation when refining than 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.480
 alright then let's relocate 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 exactly the same string that we remove 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.109
 but how do we do it good 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.600
 in this case we are going to straighten a bit 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.740
 the metal that is at the end of the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.310
 rope 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.459
 OK 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.149
 and what we are going to do is locate the side 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.149
 of the pegbox 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.680
 It is very important that you always remember 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:22.440
 the order of the sun ropes the imm and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.140
 do not go to put a rope in the key 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.209
 and wrong because they are different 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
 heights and can cause the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.930
 breaking the good rope what 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 first thing we're going to do is locate the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.319
 hole in the plug here we have it to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.010
 the best through having the plug 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.920
 inside we're going to straighten the end of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.640
 our rope and the side where it is not 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.390
 order the rope we are going to introduce 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.550
 in this way the rope and we see it how 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 that little end comes out 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.010
 the first thing is to give a first round 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.940
 until we see the end that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.490
 we let out 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.380
 a good wound that in total is the 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.370
 way in which the rope is twisted in 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.910
 peg it is first to go around the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.210
 outside of where the remnant 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.420
 on the other side of the hole after 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.380
 we keep circling 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:33.239
 and at this point we're going to step on the end 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.610
 that we left out in agreement like this 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.680
 we're going to screw it in there 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.159
 as the end is already stepped 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.870
 So far at this point we're going to do 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.569
 a little pressure on the plug to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.269
 that does not move and we keep it with 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.909
 our own hand under pressure now what 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.189
 what we are going to do is on the other side of 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.189
 violin if we can focus here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.210
 we will introduce it to the tamborcito 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.870
 this way 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.380
 they have strip strings in the tuner and 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.920
 let's do a full attention of 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.920
 the rope of agreement is this way 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.770
 we have already thought about the plug and now 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.780
 we have it fixed on the strip strings and 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.490
 now what we are going to do 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.700
 is to go around carefully 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.710
 going down going down going down 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.290
 there we can see how attention begins 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.650
 already to have our rope fixed in 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.370
 your place and finally let go of what 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.770
 we have some small grooves sometimes already 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.169
 are pre-made on the bridge that we 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.350
 indicate where the rope is going 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.529
 respect that groove that has been made 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.490
 also here in the capo 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:59.220
 if we want to see the groove 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.370
 and here we have another nut 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.330
 agreement this way of entering is very 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.430
 effective means that they are not returning 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.319
 continuously the ropes sometimes 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.330
 we have the problem that we want 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.430
 tune and the string is returned and it 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.259
 come back and this method is good 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.880
 will help us a lot if we have 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.160
 problems where the plug 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.639
 constantly you are not coming back 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.210
 wants to stay in its place of tuning and 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:31.259
 instead of filling the plug with 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.000
 a cosmetic or with tar the first thing that 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.729
 we should notice, that is, the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.710
 Twisted rope is made 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.590
 in a good way this is going to help us 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.199
 very much habitat since not new 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.780
 account installed the rope and well 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.870
 in later videos we are going to 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.060
 teach more things about how 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.759
 perform a good comparative review 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.430
 of strings we hope that it is of 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.830
 help and if you have any questions you doubt or 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.389
 comment we look forward to your opinions to 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.389
 end of this video many
