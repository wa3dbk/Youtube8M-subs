00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.269
 puncture 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.309

 all just what one already 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.390
 because at the moment you do 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.560
 there will be 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 a number of licenses

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 albania 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.720
 I am therefore afraid that I am 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.150
 well 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 everyone is welcome 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.070

 good at it 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
 ergo 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.080
 but different 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990
 moderate play poles 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:29.989
 den Helder 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 He stated earlier that he needs reforms made by the outside world 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.879
 in it they state 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.989
