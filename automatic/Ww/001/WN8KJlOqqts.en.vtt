an<00:01:47.340> area<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.939> front<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
an area right in front of you as you can

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.580 
an area right in front of you as you can
see

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
see

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.560 
see
and<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.549> bump<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.149> does

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and when you little bump but it does

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.530 
and when you little bump but it does
that<00:01:52.399> now<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.460> could<00:01:53.820> hold<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.180> mouse

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that now you could hold your mouse

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
that now you could hold your mouse
button<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.530> could<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:55.950> click<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
button down or you could just click it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.319 
button down or you could just click it
very<00:01:57.060> fast<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> blast<00:01:58.289> people<00:01:58.649> away<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.490> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
very fast in a blast people away and it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
very fast in a blast people away and it
I<00:02:00.720> believe<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.710> works<00:02:02.250> with

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I believe it actually works with

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
I believe it actually works with
vehicles<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.630> let's<00:02:03.869> go<00:02:03.990> test<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.289> out

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
vehicles as well so let's go test it out

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.089 
vehicles as well so let's go test it out
where<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> vehicles<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.509> oh

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
where are the vehicles there we go oh

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.660 
where are the vehicles there we go oh
man<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.220> could<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.580> multiple<00:02:08.970> vehicles<00:02:09.420> oh

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
man we could get multiple vehicles oh

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.180 
man we could get multiple vehicles oh
what<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> beautiful<00:02:12.120> thing<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.319> there<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
what a beautiful thing and there is a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.770 
what a beautiful thing and there is a
ouch<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.300> hurts

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
ouch that hurts

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.850 
ouch that hurts
dammit<00:02:16.560> ok<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.630> did<00:02:18.900> mention<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.650> did

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
dammit ok so I did mention that it did

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.979 
dammit ok so I did mention that it did
reminded<00:02:20.400> me<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.450> weapons<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
reminded me of one of the weapons that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.300 
reminded me of one of the weapons that
exist<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.739> game<00:02:22.920> which<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
exist in the game which is the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.759 
exist in the game which is the
telekinesis<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.720> could<00:02:25.049> actually<00:02:25.319> pull

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
telekinesis you could actually pull

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.370 
telekinesis you could actually pull
people<00:02:26.069> towards<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.640> throw<00:02:26.910> them<00:02:27.120> away

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
people towards you and throw them away

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380 
people towards you and throw them away
except<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.709> polarizer<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.549> actually<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> much

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
except the polarizer is actually a much

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.240 
except the polarizer is actually a much
more<00:02:30.630> better<00:02:30.989> version<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.890> mean<00:02:32.100> you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
more better version of it I mean you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
more better version of it I mean you
could<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:32.519> multiple<00:02:32.970> targets<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:33.600> longer

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
could do multiple targets it has longer

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.979 
could do multiple targets it has longer
range<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.730> could<00:02:36.000> spit<00:02:36.540> people<00:02:36.840> out

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
range and you could spit people out

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.229 
range and you could spit people out
further<00:02:37.349> away<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:38.130> actually<00:02:38.430> quite<00:02:38.880> cool

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
further away so it's actually quite cool

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.870 
further away so it's actually quite cool
and<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.739> know<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.040> telekinesis<00:02:41.700> could

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and like you know the telekinesis could

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.789 
and like you know the telekinesis could
do<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> same<00:02:42.299> thing<00:02:42.569> except<00:02:43.049> it's<00:02:43.230> inferior

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
do the same thing except it's inferior

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.640 
do the same thing except it's inferior
now<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> polarizer<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.180> also<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> upgradable

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
now the polarizer is also a upgradable

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.320 
now the polarizer is also a upgradable
weapon<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> could<00:02:47.489> upgrade<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.000> by<00:02:48.120> going

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
weapon and you could upgrade it by going

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.080 
weapon and you could upgrade it by going
to<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.630> friendly<00:02:49.260> fire<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.799> going<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.549> buy<00:02:50.880> an

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
to a friendly fire and going to buy an

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.789 
to a friendly fire and going to buy an
upgrade<00:02:51.239> weapon<00:02:51.930> section<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> then

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
upgrade weapon section and then

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.890 
upgrade weapon section and then
selecting<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.519> polarizer<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.299> there<00:02:54.810> are

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
selecting the polarizer and there are

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.479 
selecting the polarizer and there are
two<00:02:55.109> things<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.769> upgrade<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
two things that you can upgrade the

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.610 
two things that you can upgrade the
charge<00:02:56.760> capacity<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.930> recharge<00:02:58.380> rate

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
charge capacity and the recharge rate

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.069 
charge capacity and the recharge rate
now<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.609> charge<00:02:59.850> capacity<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.660> allows

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
now with the charge capacity it allows

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.380 
now with the charge capacity it allows
the<00:03:01.290> weapon<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.709> fire<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.400> before<00:03:02.850> its<00:03:03.030> chart

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the weapon to fire more before its chart

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.990 
the weapon to fire more before its chart
is<00:03:03.570> depleted<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.130> five<00:03:05.400> levels<00:03:05.819> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is depleted and there is five levels of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
is depleted and there is five levels of
upgrades<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.530> also<00:03:07.769> upgrade

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
upgrades for it and you can also upgrade

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.699 
upgrades for it and you can also upgrade
the<00:03:08.970> rage<00:03:09.239> heart<00:03:09.480> rate<00:03:09.690> which<00:03:10.200> lets<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
the rage heart rate which lets the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.069 
the rage heart rate which lets the
weapon<00:03:11.040> regenerate<00:03:11.670> its<00:03:11.819> ammo<00:03:12.390> charge<00:03:12.720> more

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
weapon regenerate its ammo charge more

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.780 
weapon regenerate its ammo charge more
quickly<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:13.890> also<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.340> five<00:03:14.579> levels

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
quickly and they also have five levels

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.059 
quickly and they also have five levels
of<00:03:15.030> upgrades<00:03:15.480> now<00:03:15.900> unfortunately<00:03:16.829> there

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
of upgrades now unfortunately there

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.370 
of upgrades now unfortunately there
isn't<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.670> customization<00:03:18.150> section<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.319> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
isn't a customization section so you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.129 
isn't a customization section so you
can't<00:03:19.680> customize<00:03:19.889> your<00:03:20.840> polarizer<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
can't customize your polarizer and

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.440 
can't customize your polarizer and
that's<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:22.950> unfortunate<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.790> now

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
that's kind of unfortunate it is now

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.780 
that's kind of unfortunate it is now
it's<00:03:25.139> actually<00:03:25.829> very<00:03:26.100> nice<00:03:26.340> though<00:03:26.579> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it's actually very nice though to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.910 
it's actually very nice though to
upgrade<00:03:27.269> those<00:03:27.359> weapons<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:28.260> previously

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
upgrade those weapons because previously

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.250 
upgrade those weapons because previously
you<00:03:29.069> saw<00:03:29.340> how<00:03:29.579> fast<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.630> energy<00:03:31.049> gets

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
you saw how fast the energy gets

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.809 
you saw how fast the energy gets
depleted<00:03:31.680> when<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.040> hold<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.609> left

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
depleted when you hold down the left

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.210 
depleted when you hold down the left
mouse<00:03:32.880> button<00:03:33.030> why<00:03:33.720> hello<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.200> girl<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:35.100> got
