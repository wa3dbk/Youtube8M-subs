off<00:00:24.140> from<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.130> casing<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.450> as<00:00:26.570> we<00:00:26.690> can<00:00:26.810> adjust

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
off from the casing so as we can adjust

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.010 
off from the casing so as we can adjust
it<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.530> to<00:00:28.250> do<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.610> we<00:00:29.450> have<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.810> push

it and to do that we have to push

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.150 
it and to do that we have to push
together<00:00:30.200> on<00:00:30.620> the<00:00:30.800> two<00:00:31.040> outside<00:00:31.640> prongs<00:00:33.160> you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
together on the two outside prongs you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.599 
together on the two outside prongs you
can<00:00:34.399> use<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:35.059> pair<00:00:35.749> of<00:00:35.780> small<00:00:36.230> pliers<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:37.339> push

can use a pair of small pliers to push
on<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.999> outside<00:00:38.030> prongs<00:00:40.179> or<00:00:41.179> I<00:00:41.239> prefer<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.960> use

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
on the outside prongs or I prefer to use

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.090 
on the outside prongs or I prefer to use
my<00:00:42.499> thumb<00:00:43.570> this<00:00:44.570> way<00:00:44.839> I'm<00:00:45.230> in<00:00:45.409> control<00:00:45.589> of<00:00:45.980> how

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
my thumb this way I'm in control of how

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.009 
my thumb this way I'm in control of how
much<00:00:46.249> pressure<00:00:46.519> I'm<00:00:46.789> putting<00:00:47.120> on<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.480> on<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
much pressure I'm putting on the on the

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.619 
much pressure I'm putting on the on the
prongs<00:00:48.289> and<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.429> idea<00:00:49.789> is<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.030> get<00:00:50.149> this<00:00:50.329> lug

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
prongs and the idea is to get this lug

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.939 
prongs and the idea is to get this lug
out<00:00:50.839> of<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> hole<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:51.920> dear<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.519> us

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
out of the hole one that's dear is to us

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.380 
out of the hole one that's dear is to us
so<00:00:54.949> we<00:00:55.100> hang<00:00:55.280> on<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.819> front<00:00:56.120> of<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
so we hang on to the front of the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.729 
so we hang on to the front of the
earring<00:00:56.719> on<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.979> casing<00:00:58.429> and<00:00:59.199> I'm<00:01:00.199> using<00:01:00.469> this

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
earring on the casing and I'm using this

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.160 
earring on the casing and I'm using this
thumb<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.729> push<00:01:02.139> against<00:01:03.370> this<00:01:04.370> prong<00:01:04.729> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
thumb to push against this prong and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.090 
thumb to push against this prong and
take<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.320> lug<00:01:06.560> out<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.490> hole<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:09.100> there

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
take the lug out of the hole and there

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
take the lug out of the hole and there
you<00:01:10.219> have<00:01:10.250> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
you have it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.069 
you have it
okay<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:12.740> let's<00:01:13.159> release<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.579> clip<00:01:14.079> next

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
okay so let's release the clip next

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.499 
okay so let's release the clip next
thing<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:15.380> need<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.530> do<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.909> adjust<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
thing we need to do is to adjust the

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.660 
thing we need to do is to adjust the
clip<00:01:17.780> itself<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:18.740> part<00:01:19.070> that's

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
clip itself because this part that's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.139 
clip itself because this part that's
causing<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.630> earring<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.259> go<00:01:21.439> slack<00:01:22.149> now

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
causing the earring to go slack now

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.580 
causing the earring to go slack now
you'll<00:01:23.539> notice<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:24.229> there<00:01:24.439> are<00:01:24.560> three

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
you'll notice that there are three

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.539 
you'll notice that there are three
prongs<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.590> middle<00:01:27.799> prong<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.250> raised

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
prongs and the middle prong is raised

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.230 
prongs and the middle prong is raised
quite<00:01:29.060> considerably<00:01:29.659> away<00:01:30.649> from<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.030> outer

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
quite considerably away from the outer

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.749 
quite considerably away from the outer
two<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.619> all<00:01:33.799> these<00:01:33.979> prongs<00:01:34.250> should<00:01:34.490> really

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
two now all these prongs should really

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.420 
two now all these prongs should really
be<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:34.909> alignment<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:35.930> way<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.159> clip

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
be in alignment and that way the clip

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.179 
be in alignment and that way the clip
will<00:01:37.609> be<00:01:37.640> nice<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.119> tight<00:01:38.329> right<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:39.770> do<00:01:39.950> this

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
will be nice and tight right to do this

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.249 
will be nice and tight right to do this
as<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.850> said<00:01:41.090> we're<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.630> use<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.869> kitchen

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
as I said we're going to use a kitchen

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.669 
as I said we're going to use a kitchen
fork<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.689> we<00:01:44.689> lay<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:48.020> back<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.439> clip

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
fork and we lay the the back of the clip

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.319 
fork and we lay the the back of the clip
onto<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.549> kitchen<00:01:49.729> fork<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> prongs

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
onto the kitchen fork with the prongs

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.240 
onto the kitchen fork with the prongs
uppermost<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.079> can<00:01:54.320> use<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.649> kitchen<00:01:54.829> knife

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
uppermost so I can use the kitchen knife

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.270 
uppermost so I can use the kitchen knife
to<00:01:56.240> push<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.750> middle<00:01:56.990> prong<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.590> that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
to push on the middle prong and that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.830 
to push on the middle prong and that
will<00:01:58.429> go<00:01:58.579> between<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:59.179> prongs<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.749> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
will go between the prongs of the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.300 
will go between the prongs of the
kitchen<00:02:00.200> fork<00:02:02.289> not<00:02:03.289> too<00:02:03.560> hard<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:03.979> yet<00:02:04.189> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
kitchen fork not too hard just yet the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.190 
kitchen fork not too hard just yet the
idea<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.789> this<00:02:04.969> is<00:02:05.179> not<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.479> bend<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:05.899> middle

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
idea of this is not to bend the middle

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840 
idea of this is not to bend the middle
prong<00:02:06.499> too<00:02:06.770> much<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.189> to<00:02:07.310> bring<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
prong too much is to bring it on the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.500 
prong too much is to bring it on the
line<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.039> outside<00:02:10.789> two<00:02:11.030> prongs<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
line with the outside two prongs and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.720 
line with the outside two prongs and
that<00:02:11.629> one's<00:02:11.810> still<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.050> little<00:02:12.230> bit<00:02:12.349> raised<00:02:12.730> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
that one's still a little bit raised so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.320 
that one's still a little bit raised so
it<00:02:13.849> gives<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.180> again

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
it gives that again

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.450 
it gives that again
give<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.200> more<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.470> pushy<00:02:17.710> best<00:02:18.010> off<00:02:18.190> doing

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
give a bit more of pushy best off doing

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.450 
give a bit more of pushy best off doing
this<00:02:18.550> bit<00:02:18.760> by<00:02:18.940> bit<00:02:18.970> then<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:21.040> at<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.430> a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
this bit by bit then go at it like a

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
little bit fiddly when you first try

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.239 
little bit fiddly when you first try
them<00:05:03.809> it<00:05:04.809> does<00:05:05.019> get<00:05:05.199> easier<00:05:05.319> in<00:05:05.679> time<00:05:05.919> believe

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249

me<00:05:06.989> but<00:05:07.989> as<00:05:08.139> you've<00:05:08.289> seen<00:05:08.319> it<00:05:09.099> cannot<00:05:09.369> be<00:05:09.549> done

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
me but as you've seen it cannot be done
