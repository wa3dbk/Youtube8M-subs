this<00:01:08.040> effect<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:09.720> now

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
this effect so as you can see right now

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.640 
this effect so as you can see right now
actually<00:01:11.010> let's<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.340> slow<00:01:11.549> down<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.030> road

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
actually let's just slow down the road

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.840 
actually let's just slow down the road
render<00:01:13.650> settings<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> doesn't<00:01:14.729> take

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
render settings so it doesn't take

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
render settings so it doesn't take
forever<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
forever but as you can see it's just the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.649 
forever but as you can see it's just the
basic<00:01:18.890> animation<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.250> logo<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> whatever

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
basic animation or logo or the whatever

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
basic animation or logo or the whatever
you<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> call<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> has<00:01:23.340> no<00:01:23.549> wires

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you want to call it and it has no wires

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
you want to call it and it has no wires
as<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.900> many<00:01:25.229> different<00:01:25.560> ways

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
as now and there is many different ways

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
as now and there is many different ways
on<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> i'll<00:01:27.299> show<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.540> some

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
on how to do this and i'll show you some

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
on how to do this and i'll show you some
of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> ways<00:01:28.170> i<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.270> um

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
of the ways i know on how to do it so um

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960 
of the ways i know on how to do it so um
yeah<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.430> i<00:01:32.460> did<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.939> for

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
yeah and this is the way i did it for

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480 
yeah and this is the way i did it for
the<00:01:33.119> intro<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> background<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.799> once<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the intro and the background so once you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
the intro and the background so once you
have<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> your

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
have this you just want to have your

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.940 
have this you just want to have your
design<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> could<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.590> anything

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
design you could do it on anything

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.760 
design you could do it on anything
anything<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:38.790> inside<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:40.079> scene<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
anything that's inside the scene it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
anything that's inside the scene it
would<00:01:41.070> come<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.180> wired<00:01:42.390> depending<00:01:42.960> if

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
would come out to be wired depending if

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
would come out to be wired depending if
it<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> lot<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> segments<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.790> each

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it has a lot of segments for each

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
it has a lot of segments for each
segment<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> wire<00:01:46.680> or

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
segment you have you would get a wire or

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
segment you have you would get a wire or

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.100 

where<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:33.470> all<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.830> here<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:37.050> if

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
where is the set all right here so if

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.680 
where is the set all right here so if
you<00:03:37.200> render<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.530> as<00:03:37.650> an<00:03:37.770> alpha<00:03:38.040> channel<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:38.690> as

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you render it as an alpha channel if as

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.630 
you render it as an alpha channel if as
a<00:03:39.720> PNG<00:03:40.050> with<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> alpha<00:03:40.680> channel<00:03:40.710> checked<00:03:41.220> you

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
a PNG with the alpha channel checked you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.390 
a PNG with the alpha channel checked you
will<00:03:41.760> see<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:43.020> don't<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.340> don't

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
will see that you don't have you don't

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.100 
will see that you don't have you don't
need<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.850> worry<00:03:44.970> about<00:03:45.090> cutting<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.750> out<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
need to worry about cutting it out and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.890 
need to worry about cutting it out and
if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.800> didn't<00:03:47.070> know<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.700> how<00:03:47.970> you

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
if you didn't know this that's how you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900 
if you didn't know this that's how you
should<00:03:48.960> render<00:03:49.380> out<00:03:49.650> text<00:03:50.400> if<00:03:50.520> you're<00:03:50.670> making

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
should render out text if you're making

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.170 
should render out text if you're making
it<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.030> backgrounds<00:03:51.660> or<00:03:51.750> something<00:03:52.490> but<00:03:53.490> yeah

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
it for backgrounds or something but yeah

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.160 
it for backgrounds or something but yeah
so<00:03:54.420> let's<00:03:54.570> just<00:03:54.630> change<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.960> background

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
so let's just change the background

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.810 
so let's just change the background
color<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.650> black<00:03:57.170> or<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.220> dark<00:03:59.220> gray<00:03:59.400> would<00:03:59.610> work

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
color to black or a dark gray would work

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.170 
color to black or a dark gray would work
fine<00:04:01.160> all<00:04:02.160> right<00:04:02.400> let's<00:04:02.610> make<00:04:02.790> sure<00:04:02.820> this<00:04:03.120> is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
fine all right let's make sure this is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.449 
fine all right let's make sure this is
done<00:04:03.300> all<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:03.990> that's<00:04:04.200> done<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.310> just

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
done all right that's done so you just

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
just mess with the opacity and then

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.760 
just mess with the opacity and then
there<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.900> go<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.620> your

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
just had it normal and i just lower the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.940 
just had it normal and i just lower the
opacity<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:41.010> i<00:04:41.130> just<00:04:41.190> got<00:04:41.550> my<00:04:41.970> eraser

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
the opacity right here and just erase

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.030 
the opacity right here and just erase
some<00:04:48.540> parts<00:04:48.900> because<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.500> don't<00:04:49.650> want<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.919> to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
some parts because you don't want it to

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.310 
some parts because you don't want it to
look<00:04:50.190> completely<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:51.060> was<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.080> cool

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
look completely and was just a cool

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.190 
look completely and was just a cool
effect<00:04:52.440> i<00:04:52.890> guess<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:54.180> yeah<00:04:54.390> just<00:04:54.690> erase<00:04:54.960> some

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
effect i guess so yeah just erase some

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.560 
effect i guess so yeah just erase some
of<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.380> parts<00:04:55.710> just<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.400> have<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.330> look

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
of the parts just to have it look

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.870 
of the parts just to have it look
different<00:05:00.620> that's<00:05:01.620> how<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.460> you

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
different that's how you do that so you

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.120 
different that's how you do that so you
can<00:05:03.000> do<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:03.300> for<00:05:03.540> text<00:05:03.990> whatever<00:05:04.200> just<00:05:04.950> make

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
can do this for text whatever just make

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.969 
can do this for text whatever just make
sure<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.280> render<00:05:05.729> both<00:05:06.140> both<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.350> them<00:05:07.470> as<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
sure you render both both of them as the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.670 
sure you render both both of them as the
same<00:05:08.010> like<00:05:08.550> if<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:09.000> render<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.840> part<00:05:10.290> cell

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
same like if you render this part cell

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.800 
same like if you render this part cell
you<00:05:11.520> render<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.910> as<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.060> cell<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.630> then<00:05:12.690> you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
you render it as a cell and then you

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.240 
you render it as a cell and then you
move<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> camera<00:05:13.290> and<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.650> render<00:05:13.979> this

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
move the camera and you render this

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.340 
move the camera and you render this
normally<00:05:14.910> it's<00:05:15.630> not<00:05:15.870> going<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.080> look<00:05:16.169> at

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
normally it's not going to look at

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.450 
normally it's not going to look at
because<00:05:16.440> it's<00:05:16.620> not<00:05:16.860> going<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.100> be<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.280> same

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
because it's not going to be the same

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.120 
because it's not going to be the same
angle<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.060> won't<00:05:18.240> come<00:05:18.390> out<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.570> same<00:05:19.130> so

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
angle and it won't come out the same so

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.670 
angle and it won't come out the same so
now<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.600> intros<00:05:21.600> if<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.140> want<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.410> work<00:05:22.530> on

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
now for intros if you want to work on

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.070 
now for intros if you want to work on
this<00:05:22.830> using<00:05:23.220> an<00:05:23.340> intro<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:24.540> same<00:05:24.750> would<00:05:24.930> have

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
this using an intro the same would have

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.690 
this using an intro the same would have
to<00:05:25.229> go<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.410> would<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.919> render<00:05:26.100> this<00:05:26.340> two

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
to go you would have to render this two

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.100 
to go you would have to render this two
times<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.330> would<00:05:27.510> have<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.690> render<00:05:27.990> the

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
times so you would have to render the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.210 
times so you would have to render the
first<00:05:28.470> time<00:05:28.740> without<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.820> cell<00:05:30.240> render<00:05:30.630> and

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
first time without the cell render and

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.010 
first time without the cell render and
then<00:05:32.220> after<00:05:33.060> that's<00:05:33.180> done<00:05:33.570> you're<00:05:33.780> going<00:05:33.930> to

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
then after that's done you're going to

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.409 
then after that's done you're going to
have<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.290> render<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.680> using<00:05:35.160> cell<00:05:35.400> render<00:05:35.790> and

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
have to render it using cell render and

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.719 
have to render it using cell render and
I<00:05:36.540> already<00:05:36.660> have<00:05:36.930> some<00:05:37.169> done<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.740> just<00:05:38.010> for
