00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 today we are going to prepare some rolls of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.930
 Simple and delicious chicken breast 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.000
 made on the griddle or in the pot gm 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.700
 these are the ingredients breast of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.490
 chicken cut into steaks about 150 grams 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.130
 per person cheese spread or cream cheese 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.619
 0% fat a mixture of spices for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 support like this that already has salt and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.240
 last dry tomato these tomatoes are 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.599
 get in greengrocers and supermarkets 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 They are very rich and suitable as a condiment 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 even in the attack phase 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.630
 we started by extending the fillets 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.880
 breast and we put spices these 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 carmencita already have salt so no 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.440
 we need to add nothing else we cover 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 the steaks with a bit of cheese 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.300
 smear 0% fat I helped with the back 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.059
 of the spoon to spread the cheese and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 form a thin layer you know that if you 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 it is difficult to find 0% cheese 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 you can do it at home from 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.370
 yogurts if you want to see the recipe 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 Cheese click on the link that appears 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.800
 on the screen we take two or three 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.989
 dry tomato pieces per person and the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 we chop into small pieces we put a 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.360
 little of this tomato on cheese 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.790
 even 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 such a small amount gives a flavor and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.930
 a fantastic smell and now he plays 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 roll the steaks if you are using 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.980
 Thick fillets is better to roll up 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.870
 so along so that at 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.090
 cooking them the heat goes well to the 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 meat roll center according 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 I 'm going to roll them up like that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 this sense because these steaks are 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.910
 very very finite 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.979
 we go coiling pushing with the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.570
 fingers to form the roll very 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.600
 slowly because I want it to look good 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.330
 but this has no difficulty is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 just roll up push and go back to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.009
 roll up as easy as that we take a 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 stick of wood and we puncture crossing 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.270
 the meat to keep the roll 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.490
 closed you see I have the rolls 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 ready to cook first I'm going to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990
 make them in the pot gm if you prefer 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.910
 skip this and see how they are done in the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 iron click on the link on the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 screen to make the rolls in the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.500
 pot gm we select the menu plancha 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.509
 with the button + we add a little more 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.399
 time with 8 or 10 minutes will be 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.189
 enough press the middle button 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.049
 and we are ready to cook in just 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.200
 one minute in the bucket of the pot will be 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.519
 hot we can put the rolls 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.530
 we let them brown and we are giving 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.870
 turns to be done well by all 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.849
 the sides I'm using a pair of tweezers with 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.980
 the tips erased with plastic 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.930
 heat resistant so as not to scratch the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.939
 bucket as you see the rolls do not 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.310
 they hit but it's costing me to give them the 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.829
 back because I have the camera in the middle and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.349
 I'm putting my arm over it if 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.319
 we have used fine fillets the rolls 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.440
 they are ready in 4 or 5 minutes if they are 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.900
 Thick fillets will need between 6 and 8 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.299
 minutes by the way at the end of the video os 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.670
 I will tell how clean the toasted 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.370
 stays in the bucket without effort and without 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.560
 use a scouring pad to make 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.109
 the rolls on the grid will need 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.970
 a good plate that does not stick 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.099
 you have to put a couple of drops of 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.200
 oil because the chicken breast is 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.629
 hit very easily let's go 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.150
 giving the rolls going around 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.700
 to be done on all sides we leave 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.250
 to cook between 5 and 8 minutes and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.270
 will be ready to serve we remove the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.660
 wooden stick 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.520
 And look what the thing so appetizing 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.220
 accompanied with some noodles and now it 's 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.320
 here and I have a perfect dish for phase 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.930
 attack is not yet subscribed to my channel 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.330

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.190
 trick to clean the bucket of the pot 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.530
 gm we add half a glass of water with the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.020
 pot still on we let the water 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.840
 heat and stir with a spatula 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.080
 of wood so we are releasing all the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.000
 roasted this is known as defatted and 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.860
 if we had put broth instead of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.140
 water would not serve to make a 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.230
 Great sauce in just over a minute 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.680
 we have released all the toasting without scratching 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.680
 the bucket
