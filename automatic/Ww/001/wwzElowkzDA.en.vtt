00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:12.580
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.350
 commented the good video they already came out 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.650
 news of the next update and 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.900
 the dragon is on the way already Level 5 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.970
 I was waiting because there's a little one on the 5 and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.510
 almost go along with the levels so 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.430
 comes 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.130
 the dragon level 5 that will be available 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.980
 with city ​​councils level 10 while 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.349
 the dragon level 4 will go down to town halls 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.629
 level 9 to control the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.089
 standards and good let's see a little 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.069
 of the new dragon as it looks these are 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.829
 images taken from the galladón video and 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:44.289
 You see it highlights a little more all its 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.149
 structure since work at level 4 was 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.460
 almost all red and his eyes were the only thing 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.269
 that changed color not here if we see 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.979
 the new level 5 a little more changed a 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.109
 little more detailed up the horns it 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.839
 they see better not as I told them in the dragon 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.310
 Level 4 everything was the same color 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.310
 here we go 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.290
 5 and the truth does it quite well not 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.420
 they exaggerated so much they did not leave other 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.370
 more rare colors here at level level 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.350
 four see the 5 almost all the same 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.670
 color are not so distinguished 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.010
 details unless you approach 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.230
 a lot of being I do a level five centuries 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.270
 it's pretty good and as I say no no 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.120
 they changed both the color not because it was 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.030
 as before level 1 green level 2 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.510
 purple black level 3 was totally 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.640
 then already at level 4 red and this is a 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.280
 little more coffee but this one is pretty 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.050
 it looks good and we're going to see some 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.869
 repetitions of some attacks that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.280
 they did with these dragons the dragon 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.950
 currently it is not a very troop 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.020
 really used very few people what 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.510
 use since there is a very large percentage 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.210
 of losing sometimes and well that's not us 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.830
 It is convenient because we put for glasses that is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.170
 when you use the dragon that sets aside 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 dragon is very expensive I do not know how much I go to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.280
 increase with this new update 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 what will be the price but the dragon 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.420
 in itself it is expensive so there are times that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.659
 you do not earn you spend a lot so you have to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.240
 be for strong attacks and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.610
 really if they are strong attacks by 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 glasses because for farming they are not going to 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 serve here we see a bit of the new 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.209
 that brings also saw when they launched 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 the stripes the store apparently is going to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.510
 have moderate protection 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.049
 stores against lightning that's what 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.610
 People expect when you start because if 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.980
 he needs to steal a little with lightning but 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.319
 there are people who abuse stealing the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.299
 xxi the asses mostly with rays and 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.660
 for apparently his person took letters 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.549
 in the matter and already started to see that not from 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.379
 that when it releases rays it is no longer going to 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.480
 affect warehouses is what is 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.739
 he managed to see and we continue with the dragons not 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.379
 what is interesting in this 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.629
 update we see that they are disrupting 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.000
 everything pretty fast they approach there the 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.099
 queen because it starts to shoot at 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.050
 the new ones and they go between those five 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.030
 dragons manage to destroy by there already 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.730
 40 percent we also see that the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.720
 percentage bar is different change 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.820
 a little and there are other curiosities not for 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.250
 example at a glance we saw the change 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.800
 background of the characters here of the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.530
 squares in which the queen who was the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.690
 barbarian king the spells change them 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300
 see a little more purple is not something that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.490
 say this helps me but I would say to simple 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.980
 sight we can notice it can not for 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.170
 change this game a bit that you do not 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.030
 run even though I tell you it does not work much 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.470
 but they are small changes that are 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.450
 doing the game and I am 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.310
 bringing everything and ready 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.260
 finished with the village is a village at 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.270
 maximum although he did not have troops in the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.540
 clan castle that this is always 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.700
 very important in an attack when you go to 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.700
 attack what comes out in the castle island 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.820
 is the paramount thing to see if you win the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.010
 attack or not in this case there was nothing and 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.290
 well let's go with another attack here put 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.570
 a little more attention then with 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.220
 dragons and minions is a combination 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.020
 something weird 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.390
 and at the beginning I think he did it 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.820
 pretty bad because the minions would go 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.800
 first and then the dragons would go 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.540
 so that to distract the defense 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.010
 aerial on the right side iván 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.160
 again here we see what the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.260
 protection in the gold store I tell them 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.840
 this is very likely that if it came from that 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.700
 the protection of the warehouses and it was already 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 a fact there are times that many people 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.680
 he complained that his elixir was stolen 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.150
 dark above all I tell them it was because 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.430
 what they complained about most but then here 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.980
 the dragons come to destroy is what 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.750
 we care about it pretty well froze but 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.120
 with the day I think it would have been 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.250
 better to release the minions for and also 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.560
 destroying along with the dragons it 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.540
 it took a lot of the minions because they have to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 go protected too or you can use them 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.490
 to distract that defense to take the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.380
 bombs I do not know you also have to have 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.060
 careful to put together the many and the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.580
 infernal towers if they are on targets 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.740
 multiple so they're going to affect us by 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.419
 there we also see two controllers already 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.340
 them another one of the novelties now they are going to 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.950
 be two air traffic controllers we saw it in 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.260
 previous battle 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.480
 two air traffic controllers but something 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.890
 important and that the dragons are coming 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.570
 little by little to him 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.610
 well here we are seeing that it barely goes down 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.440
 40% will not make do 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.060
 City Hall star does not carry 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.090
 we break so that they are going to take 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.280
 many kings if you risk releasing them 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.340
 but well I wanted to show you this and 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.150
 see here when he went down the shot is shown 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.550
 this construction that I believe is a 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.490
 I do not know is the spell factory I do not know 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.130
 what do you think you really do not know 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.360
 but it is there and I want me to 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.400
 leave here below in the comments that 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.500
 they think it's just like we have this 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.510
 little button from here to the left in the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.330
 which are we going to be able to put our troops 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.400
 just squeezing it and it's pretty useful 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.490
 well I for example for when you're 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.600
 attacking at higher levels with these 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.760
 troops and you do not have to be 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.330
 coming back you take out everything with gems and you follow 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.610
 attacking is something a little more than people 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.040
 maybe up may work more 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.750
 to them that if you do not have time to 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.580
 be coming back and see which troops are not 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.110
 you have and what is empty in which barracks 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.360
 You have troops in room 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.650
 fourth the name and well then this is 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.900
 basically everything I saw in the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.750
 update the most important thing is the 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.270
 dragon level 5 and we'll see maybe a little 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.190
 more information about this new 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.830
 construction or a new level of 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.420
 construction that I believe is a 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.060
 spell cauldron called factory 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.130
 of spells and then leave nothing here below 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.620
 in the comments what do you think of this in 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.300
 end I hope you liked it and we 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.610
 we see until the next video 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.880
 bye we will be bringing all the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.880
 news
