00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
mechanical pencil it's kind of a little

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
mechanical pencil it's kind of a little
bit<00:00:17.310> more<00:00:17.490> stylish<00:00:17.730> than<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.570> lot<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.109> basic

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380

metallic<00:00:19.800> mechanical<00:00:20.369> pencils<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
metallic mechanical pencils a lot of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.019 
metallic mechanical pencils a lot of
people<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> thicker<00:00:23.369> design<00:00:23.730> because

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
people like the thicker design because

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
people like the thicker design because
it<00:00:24.180> does<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:25.529> bit<00:00:25.650> easier<00:00:25.890> to

which<00:00:34.290> has<00:00:34.940> sort<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.149> basically<00:00:36.840> three

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
which has sort of like basically three

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.340

this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.750> very<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:49.190> received<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:51.710> long-term

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
this is very well received for long-term

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
this is very well received for long-term
writing<00:00:53.219> use<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.699> find<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> be

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
writing use and I do find it to be

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
writing use and I do find it to be
extremely<00:00:54.660> comfortable<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.410> only<00:00:55.590> downside

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
extremely comfortable the only downside

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
extremely comfortable the only downside
to<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> would<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.480> it's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to this would be that because it's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
to this would be that because it's
triangular<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:59.489> can't<00:00:59.699> really<00:00:59.969> hold<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> on

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
triangular you can't really hold it on

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
triangular you can't really hold it on
the<00:01:01.469> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> tips<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.750> each<00:01:03.930> side<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the kind of tips of each side so this is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
the kind of tips of each side so this is
basically<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.150> only<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.510> you're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
basically the only way you're going to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
basically the only way you're going to
hold<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.170> exactly<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
hold it is exactly like this with the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
hold it is exactly like this with the
clip<00:01:09.450> facing<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> tried<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
clip facing that way if you tried to do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
clip facing that way if you tried to do
it<00:01:11.280> any<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it any other way would kind of be in

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
it any other way would kind of be in
your<00:01:13.409> hand<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> wouldn't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
your hand a little bit so that wouldn't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.499 
your hand a little bit so that wouldn't
really<00:01:15.900> work<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> big<00:01:16.830> deal<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
really work but not a big deal I

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
really work but not a big deal I
shouldn't<00:01:18.509> mention<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> tip<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.920> shock

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
shouldn't mention the tip it's a shock

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
shouldn't mention the tip it's a shock
absorbing<00:01:21.299> retractable<00:01:21.869> tip<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.680> reduced

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
absorbing retractable tip for reduced

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.570 
absorbing retractable tip for reduced
lead<00:01:23.520> breakage<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.580> nothing

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
lead breakage and as you can see nothing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.480 
lead breakage and as you can see nothing
here<00:01:26.759> yet<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> click<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
here yet and when you do one click the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
here yet and when you do one click the
tip<00:01:29.670> comes<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.409> looks<00:01:31.740> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
tip comes out and it actually looks like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670 
tip comes out and it actually looks like
it's<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.689> pen<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> point<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.470> looks<00:01:34.619> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it's a pen at this point just looks like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.940 
it's a pen at this point just looks like
a<00:01:34.770> pen<00:01:35.040> tip<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> continue<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> click<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
a pen tip if you continue to click the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
a pen tip if you continue to click the
light<00:01:38.100> comes<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.299> that's<00:01:39.450> pretty<00:01:39.630> neat

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
light comes out so that's pretty neat

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
light comes out so that's pretty neat
and<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.799> goes<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.159> way

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and it's good that it goes all the way

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
and it's good that it goes all the way
back<00:01:41.340> again<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> don't<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> worry<00:01:42.150> about

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
back again you don't have to worry about

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.670 
back again you don't have to worry about
putting<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.780> pocket<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.229> anything<00:01:43.409> like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that the pocket clip on the pen does

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
that the pocket clip on the pen does
feel<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:47.880> pretty<00:01:48.450> strong<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.439> made

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
feel good pretty strong it's just made

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260

gray<00:01:51.899> plastic<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.490> doesn't<00:01:53.729> feel

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
gray plastic here but it doesn't feel

don't<00:05:12.660> get<00:05:12.750> too<00:05:12.900> much<00:05:13.050> dust<00:05:13.350> with<00:05:13.530> this<00:05:13.650> which

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
don't get too much dust with this which

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.610 
don't get too much dust with this which
is<00:05:13.830> good<00:05:14.720> it's<00:05:15.720> very<00:05:15.780> smooth<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.350> doesn't

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
is good it's very smooth and doesn't

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.050 
is good it's very smooth and doesn't
feel<00:05:16.740> like<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.980> wears<00:05:17.130> on<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.400> paper<00:05:17.580> at<00:05:17.760> all

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
feel like it wears on the paper at all

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:43.730 
feel like it wears on the paper at all
also<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.390> good<00:05:18.570> thing

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.930 

so<00:05:44.740> as<00:05:44.830> you<00:05:44.919> can<00:05:45.039> see<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.250> eraser<00:05:45.580> performs

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
so as you can see the eraser performs

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.170 
so as you can see the eraser performs
pretty<00:05:46.240> well<00:05:46.479> even<00:05:46.810> when<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:46.990> write<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:49.090> know

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
pretty well even when I write you know

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.809 
pretty well even when I write you know
kind<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.419> very<00:05:50.110> very<00:05:50.340> pressed<00:05:51.340> down<00:05:51.490> hard<00:05:51.729> and

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
kind of very very pressed down hard and

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.409 
kind of very very pressed down hard and
write<00:05:52.000> very<00:05:52.210> dark<00:05:53.099> pencil<00:05:54.099> marks<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:55.030> erases

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
write very dark pencil marks it erases

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.080 
write very dark pencil marks it erases
them<00:05:55.539> pretty<00:05:56.289> substantially<00:05:56.919> like<00:05:57.400> to<00:05:57.819> medium

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
them pretty substantially like to medium

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.689 
them pretty substantially like to medium
pencil<00:05:58.389> marks<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:58.900> erases<00:05:59.229> almost<00:05:59.500> completely

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.920 

did<00:06:03.699> a<00:06:03.729> little<00:06:03.940> bit<00:06:04.060> of<00:06:04.150> writing<00:06:04.300> prior<00:06:04.630> just

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
did a little bit of writing prior just

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.400 
did a little bit of writing prior just
to<00:06:05.020> test<00:06:05.229> much<00:06:05.979> of<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.190> same<00:06:07.199> writes<00:06:08.199> very

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
to test much of the same writes very

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.490 
to test much of the same writes very
well<00:06:08.650> erases<00:06:09.580> cleanly<00:06:09.940> feel<00:06:10.900> smooth<00:06:11.259> in<00:06:11.410> your

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
well erases cleanly feel smooth in your

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
well erases cleanly feel smooth in your
hand<00:06:11.710> didn't<00:06:12.580> get<00:06:12.669> any<00:06:12.789> breaks<00:06:13.030> at<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.300> point

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.650 

so<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.550> lot<00:06:18.789> of<00:06:18.820> good<00:06:19.090> things<00:06:19.270> with<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.479> pen

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
so a lot of good things with the pen

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.469 
so a lot of good things with the pen
know<00:06:20.199> one<00:06:20.320> thing<00:06:20.440> is<00:06:20.560> because<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:21.009> its<00:06:21.160> size

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
know one thing is because of its size

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.700 
know one thing is because of its size
really<00:06:22.479> wouldn't<00:06:22.750> be<00:06:22.900> used<00:06:23.320> well<00:06:23.530> for

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
really wouldn't be used well for

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.890 
really wouldn't be used well for
drafting<00:06:24.099> or<00:06:24.220> anything<00:06:24.400> like<00:06:24.639> that<00:06:24.900> since

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
drafting or anything like that since

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.550 
drafting or anything like that since
you'd<00:06:26.050> be<00:06:26.199> kind<00:06:26.380> of<00:06:26.470> against<00:06:27.190> a<00:06:27.250> ruler<00:06:28.530> it's<00:06:29.530> a

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
you'd be kind of against a ruler it's a

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.469 
you'd be kind of against a ruler it's a
little<00:06:29.770> bit<00:06:29.889> too<00:06:30.009> thick<00:06:30.280> and<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.669> thinner

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
little bit too thick and a thinner

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.469 
little bit too thick and a thinner
smaller<00:06:31.720> mechanical<00:06:32.560> pencil<00:06:32.860> would<00:06:33.479> probably

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
smaller mechanical pencil would probably

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.749 
smaller mechanical pencil would probably
be<00:06:34.780> your<00:06:35.650> best<00:06:35.860> bet<00:06:36.009> for<00:06:36.070> something<00:06:36.460> like<00:06:36.580> that

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
be your best bet for something like that

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.969 
be your best bet for something like that
even<00:06:37.389> do<00:06:37.509> that<00:06:37.659> to<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.229> tip<00:06:38.500> since<00:06:38.710> it's<00:06:38.889> a

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
even do that to the tip since it's a

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.629 
even do that to the tip since it's a
kind<00:06:39.639> of<00:06:39.699> a<00:06:39.789> cone<00:06:39.970> shaped<00:06:40.270> tip<00:06:41.490> might<00:06:42.490> be<00:06:42.610> a

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
kind of a cone shaped tip might be a

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.040 
kind of a cone shaped tip might be a
little<00:06:42.880> bit<00:06:43.000> too<00:06:43.150> wide<00:06:43.360> for<00:06:43.389> a<00:06:43.659> lot<00:06:43.960> of

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
little bit too wide for a lot of

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.020 
little bit too wide for a lot of
precision<00:06:45.599> applications<00:06:47.220> so<00:06:48.220> overall<00:06:48.820> it's<00:06:49.000> a

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
precision applications so overall it's a

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.420 
precision applications so overall it's a
very<00:06:49.060> good<00:06:49.300> pencil<00:06:49.590> the<00:06:50.590> eraser<00:06:50.949> is<00:06:51.039> very<00:06:51.220> good

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
very good pencil the eraser is very good

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.260 
very good pencil the eraser is very good
the<00:06:51.880> fact<00:06:52.060> that<00:06:52.470> it<00:06:53.639> accepts<00:06:54.639> these<00:06:54.909> jumbo

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
the fact that it accepts these jumbo

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.740 
the fact that it accepts these jumbo
erasers<00:06:55.630> is<00:06:55.780> also<00:06:57.150> you<00:06:58.150> know<00:06:58.300> a<00:06:58.449> strong

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
erasers is also you know a strong
