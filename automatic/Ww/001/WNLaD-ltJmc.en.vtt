00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
see of the 145 the key of F I can't talk

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.910 
see of the 145 the key of F I can't talk
and<00:01:00.770> play<00:01:04.630> and<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:05.840> from<00:01:06.260> where<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.530> pinky<00:01:06.830> is

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
there make that the one new know for the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
there make that the one new know for the
F<00:01:12.940> F<00:01:14.680> by<00:01:15.680> yellow<00:01:16.330> my<00:01:17.330> four<00:01:17.570> chord<00:01:17.870> or<00:01:18.440> might<00:01:18.590> be

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
F F by yellow my four chord or might be

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.650 
F F by yellow my four chord or might be
flat<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:19.820> frets<00:01:20.030> lower<00:01:20.300> my<00:01:21.170> red<00:01:22.570> for<00:01:23.570> my

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
flat and two frets lower my red for my

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.870 
flat and two frets lower my red for my
five<00:01:23.869> chord<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.410> we're<00:01:24.920> not<00:01:25.040> using<00:01:25.190> sevens<00:01:25.670> for

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
five chord so we're not using sevens for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.060 
five chord so we're not using sevens for
these<00:01:26.000> dominance<00:01:26.690> yet<00:01:27.530> because<00:01:27.740> those<00:01:27.890> are

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
these dominance yet because those are

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.590 
these dominance yet because those are
substitutions<00:01:28.850> or<00:01:28.970> we'll<00:01:29.090> talk<00:01:29.330> about<00:01:29.479> that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
substitutions or we'll talk about that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.500 
substitutions or we'll talk about that
theory<00:01:30.260> when<00:01:30.440> we<00:01:30.530> get<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.800> them<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.070> red<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.729> mean

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
theory when we get to them so red I mean

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.310 
theory when we get to them so red I mean
blue<00:01:32.750> I'm<00:01:32.960> sorry<00:01:33.250> yeah<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:35.780> think<00:01:36.050> about<00:01:36.140> my

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
blue I'm sorry yeah just think about my

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:47.080 
blue I'm sorry yeah just think about my
red<00:01:36.500> cord<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.830> my<00:01:38.770> down<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.800> substitution<00:01:46.090> we

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
red cord is my down a substitution we

00:01:47.090 --> 00:02:02.529 
red cord is my down a substitution we
need<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.390> get<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:47.840> well<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:54.009> in<00:01:55.009> red<00:02:01.539> and

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
need to get that down well so in red and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.850 
need to get that down well so in red and
when<00:02:02.780> we're<00:02:02.899> done<00:02:02.929> with<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.740> really

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
when we're done with that and really

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160 
when we're done with that and really
have<00:02:04.160> that<00:02:04.369> down<00:02:04.729> well<00:02:05.060> then<00:02:05.690> we<00:02:05.810> really<00:02:05.960> go<00:02:06.080> on

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
have that down well then we really go on

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.600 
have that down well then we really go on
to<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.380> next<00:02:06.560> understanding<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.369> these

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
to the next understanding of these

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.590 
to the next understanding of these
things<00:02:07.789> because<00:02:08.030> we're<00:02:08.210> gonna<00:02:08.300> be<00:02:08.390> able<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
things because we're gonna be able to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.450 
things because we're gonna be able to
put<00:02:08.690> melodies<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.440> them<00:02:09.619> if<00:02:10.190> we<00:02:10.310> know<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
put melodies to them if we know the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.010 
put melodies to them if we know the
progressions<00:02:11.030> well<00:02:11.240> we're<00:02:11.600> gonna<00:02:11.720> learn<00:02:11.780> some

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
progressions well we're gonna learn some

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.870 
progressions well we're gonna learn some
simple<00:02:12.230> scales<00:02:12.680> this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.490> what<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.700> talked

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
simple scales this is what we talked

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.350 
simple scales this is what we talked
about<00:02:13.910> with<00:02:14.270> modes<00:02:14.710> Ionian<00:02:15.710> Lydian

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
about with modes Ionian Lydian

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.910 
about with modes Ionian Lydian
mixolydian<00:02:17.440> Phrygian<00:02:18.440> we're<00:02:18.590> going<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.770> use

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
mixolydian Phrygian we're going to use

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440 
mixolydian Phrygian we're going to use
all<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.280> those<00:02:19.370> things<00:02:19.430> we're<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.330> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
all of those things we're not going to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.550 
all of those things we're not going to
really<00:02:20.600> worry<00:02:20.840> about<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.080> name<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.319> just

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
really worry about the name is just

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.390 
really worry about the name is just
going<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.770> memorize<00:02:22.130> some<00:02:22.280> forms<00:02:22.640> all<00:02:23.180> right
