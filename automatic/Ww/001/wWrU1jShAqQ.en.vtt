in a couple of months on this is our
bricks<00:00:16.320> nass<00:00:16.770> device<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> ultra

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
bricks nass device this is a ultra

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490 
bricks nass device this is a ultra
compact<00:00:19.380> pc<00:00:20.270> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> Haswell<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.350> its

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
compact pc this is a Haswell so its

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
compact pc this is a Haswell so its
fourth<00:00:22.740> generation<00:00:23.220> fourth-generation<00:00:24.119> core

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

intel<00:00:25.080> processor<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:26.730> guy<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:26.970> unique

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
intel processor this guy is unique

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.750 
intel processor this guy is unique
because<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.109> four<00:00:28.560> slots<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.519> hard

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
because it's got four slots for hard

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.020 
because it's got four slots for hard
drives<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.050> terabyte<00:00:31.560> each<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.669> TB

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
drives up to one terabyte each so for TB

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.530 
drives up to one terabyte each so for TB
total<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> personal<00:00:35.250> cloud<00:00:35.700> Nass

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
server what we're positioning this for
is<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> first<00:00:41.280> Haswell<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
is one this is the first Haswell that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
is one this is the first Haswell that
we've<00:00:42.030> done<00:00:42.210> that's<00:00:42.420> android-based<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.829> as
