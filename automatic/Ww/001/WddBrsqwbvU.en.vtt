last Dragonball Z game that I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.900 
last Dragonball Z game that I
practically<00:00:19.770> played<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.279> great<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.760> me

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
was Dragon was a tin Chi Chi tag team it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.960 
was Dragon was a tin Chi Chi tag team it
was<00:00:22.890> actually<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> most<00:00:23.340> recent<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you played it as much as I have there

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.490 
you played it as much as I have there
are<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.450> characters<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> few

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
are some characters that have a few

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
are some characters that have a few
things<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.850> give<00:00:51.000> them<00:00:51.149> an

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
things that are that they give them an

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.869 
things that are that they give them an
edge<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.719> Gogeta<00:00:52.199> he<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.949> much<00:00:53.219> power<00:00:53.520> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
edge like Gogeta he has so much power in

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
edge like Gogeta he has so much power in
tanky<00:00:54.449> ihe<00:00:54.719> -<00:00:54.930> he's<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> strongest<00:00:55.890> character

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
tanky ihe - he's the strongest character

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
tanky ihe - he's the strongest character
by<00:00:56.280> far<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> no<00:00:57.360> comparison<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
by far there is no comparison and I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
by far there is no comparison and I
think<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.800> even<00:00:58.829> stated<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.520> he's<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think they even stated that he's the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.840 
think they even stated that he's the
best<00:01:00.059> character<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.219> most<00:01:02.370> part<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
best character but for the most part I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.329 
best character but for the most part I
think<00:01:03.210> games<00:01:03.629> after<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.409> kiss<00:01:04.619> -<00:01:04.830> era<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
think games after the kiss - era and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
think games after the kiss - era and
maybe<00:01:05.670> even<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> PSP<00:01:06.540> era<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:07.049> went

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
maybe even the PSP era have went

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
maybe even the PSP era have went
