00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.400
Hard Man

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Speaker : These two female fans are chosen as VIP.
Give them light hugs later.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.720
Speaker : Is it okay? If it's too much, then you don't have to.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.840
Impact : Can I not do it? I don't think I have to.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.200
Speaker : Does he have a girl friend?
Bengi : He doesn't.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.935
Speaker : You don't even have a girl friend.
Impact : Nah~

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:28.695
Spearker : Then you have to shake hands with them.
That's do-able right?
Impact : Yeap!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.200
Impact doesn't allow light hugs for his fans...being expensive.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.000
That's his destiny.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.600
Bengi : Yo. Blitz is better than Thresh.
Impact : Blitz has higher damage.

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:49.728
Bengi : Yeap. If Blitz pulls adc, then yea.
Impact : If he can't, then you'll lose the game.
Bengi : True.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.940
Two players talk about Blitz's destiny to pull adc.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.960
Whatever!

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.720
Bengi :Are we playing as supporters?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.284
Impact : Nope. You can adc or a supporter. You have to decide that.

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:11.902
Bengi : Wanna ask?
Impact : Let's just choose. What adc should we play?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.700
Bengi : I'm fine with any adc champs.
Impact : What do you want?

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860
Bengi : Lucian.
Impact : Lucian?
Bengi : Help Lucian!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.694
Impact : Unwise choice.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.518
Impact : I'm going to play Janna, then. Graves and Janna!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.411
Bengi : I'll ask them now. Whether we are supp or adc.
Let's choose first.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.672
Impact : I don't think we are supp.
Bengi : I think so.

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:34.400
Impact : Did you choose what adc you are going to play?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.059
Impact : Tell me!
Bengi : Ez? Ez vs Ez? That's not bad.

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:44.336
Impact : Are you going to play that? It's going to be boring.
Bengi : Why? it's a micro fight if it Ez Mirror lane.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.080
Impact : It's going to be Q all the way.
Bengi : Tac-Tac-Tac-Tac!

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
Impact : All about the supp then. Pushing side will win the lane.
Bengi : True.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.340
Bengi : Honestly, any adc will be the same.
If it's Blitz, I'm going to pull and finish the game.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.860
Impact : Adc...mmhmm.
Bengi : Graves!

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.069
Impact : I'm going to play Annie, then.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.323
Bengi : Is it okay if I play weird champ for adc?

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:14.761
Bengi : Ha-I-Ya (Renga Voice?)
Impact : Do it.

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.498
Bengi : My champ's gonna explode.
Impact : I'm going to play Annie.

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:20.206
Bengi : Are you really going to play Annie?
Impact : Not sure, but...Annie sounds good.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.206
Bengi : I don't know. Do whatever you want?
Impact : Play any champ.
Bengi : I'm going to pick Thresh.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.480
The negotiation failed as they are going to play
the champs they want to play.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.869
Dramatic Negotiaion Agreement.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:39.018
Bengi : What's a fun champ? Supp Jarvan?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.655
Impact : I'm going to bottom.
Bengi : renga supp?

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:46.675
Impact : It' going to REALLY funny.
Bengi : Ha-I-Ya

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.492
Bengi : If we are supp, then let's play Blitz. For adc, any champs?
Impact : Okay.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.220
Impact : Nice.
Bengi : Lucian, please.

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:07.417
Impact : Let's do a random pick, and first adc is the one to play.
Bengi : (Nod)

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:11.737
Negotiation ends with random pick for adc.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.220
Settled

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.400
Speaker : I heard that you played a lot with "NeClit" user,
and raised your points. What's your rank now?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.077
Bengi : I'm Challenger right now.
I have two IDs, and the main one is bit dangerous.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.184
Speaker : Ah~ Your main ID might fall into Master Tier?!
What about your sub-ID? What's the rank?

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:35.024
Bengi : I think it's rank 50.

00:03:35.024 --> 00:03:41.020
Speaker : Class never changes. How about Impact?
Do you practice a lot these days?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.822
Impact : Mine goes to Challenger and to Master Tier,
but I'm settling down now.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.435
Speaker : Where are you settling down?
Impact : Challenger!

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.120
Speaker : What's your rank in the Challenger?

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.870
Impact : Not sure, but between 100 and 120?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.350
Impact is now settled in Challenger! Hopefully
he will earn the Challenger Mark for the next season.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.940
Advertising the real name.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.885
Speaker : This is an easy question for everyone.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.520
Speaker : "JangByeongGi" Bengi can read the question, and...

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.819
Still confused with "JangByeongGi" as a real name or not.
Let's advertise !

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.919
