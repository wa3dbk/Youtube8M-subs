00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.760
 garden friends my respectable and that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.099
 france is the louis or mine 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 also depending on how you like it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.280
 would like to pronounce 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 that's definitely another one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.800
 female companions you per 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.660
 mod for your skyrim pc version 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.279
 if you can download it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.289
 downloaded and installed 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.720
 Can you find them in New York Oscar 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 So the home of the companions in white 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 They are originally coming here 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 this wolf armor, therefore, and I think 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.649
 Of course the armor makes a lot 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.660
 from how such a character works there 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.420
 Basically, two kinds of variations 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.270
 that is the one with the variant here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 the short hair I here something 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 tighter armor stuck with it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 the whole a bit feminine about it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 it is very easy to show conspicuous yes me 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.980
 She would say she has a few scars in it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.350
 face and just the short hair it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 but there is a second parallel 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 version so you can go two if 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110
 download and take turns 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
 to install 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 yes and although it is really only the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 hairs are the ones that have been changed affects the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.820
 character but clearly different so has 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 here too, even if I have the hair 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.299
 forward to me with these 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.350
 stories do not like her so much 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 always has to be a heavy one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 The armor is worn otherwise 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.189
 forward so somehow a very small 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 but they are floating in the air 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.479
 also comes here as I would say as 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 warrior is all right over here 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.210
 a remote session of a nightingale 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 Armor I've already got that sword 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 shown in another armor 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.790
 if that interests you 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.310
 basically , she is a right one 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.820
 warrior she comes with such perks 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 therefore like batteries champions the true ones 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.670
 stars britta and you can in the reason 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.030
 taken really neat on it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.860
 So it's not magic but how 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 I can not find a bad one now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.719
 Accompaniment there are a total of four if 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.090
 the airline can so the two main 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.259
 if just with long or short hair 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.820
 I change again here briefly 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.039
 and then there are those too 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.679
 possibility a little something with her 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.510
 to make body and that gives 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.370
 so the texture was me here 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.359
 have hung up there you can see that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.950
 the hartz a little bit more 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.260
 that shines in general, too 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.359
 download all the others I like that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.230
 not so that's supposed to be a bit 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.200
 look sweaty or if it rains 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.849
 This is a bit too shiny for me 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.439
 I'll just tell you who it is 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.200
 I do not like why I did not think so 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:33.109
 also shows this variant was the fourth 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.810
 Variation would just be that on everyone 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.549
 case always underwear wears yes 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.189
 Of course you will find the course 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.900
 link to this mod in the video 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.359
 description and there are also one 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.970
 some default mods you use 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.189
 could and what i noticed is it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.049
 There is a murder for the names she has 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.930
 so took over the mouth if you like that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.430
 used that is kiss media stars bike 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 senius so if he does not 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.669
 should have installed the power 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.109
 Scars her face a bit 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.480
 so handsome looks so one 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 but it is not just 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.099
 I would like to say that simple yes 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.870
 as a mixture of one-handed or 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.639
 ambidextrous warrior is always one 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.930
 little contrast to the whole elves 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.830
 which I always like to show 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.010
 or to all the great ones 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.880
 but by magic notice 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.740
 Nonetheless, if you have one 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.560
 You like the character 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.120
 also by the eu on the spot very easy 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.740
 magic books in hand and also 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 learn magic but basically could 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.440
 as if they were after 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.600
 and I thought maybe that fits 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.570
 quite a bit in such a something 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.690
 rougher place skyrim field i am am 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.160
 I think about my complete scan 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.440
 Raumordnerischen should and the whole new 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.240
 install and then a little bit that 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.930
 all a bit more mature and brave 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.290
 do 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.570
 look at your opinion counts say we 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.120
 what do you think about Luise and if 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.410
 you like it then just down and 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.030
 then the video is already out I say 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.350
 thanks for watching until next 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.350
 times and haut rein
