than<00:02:24.170> tech<00:02:25.170> blogs<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.190> makes<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.460> lot

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
than tech blogs I think that makes a lot

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.460 
than tech blogs I think that makes a lot
of<00:02:26.640> sense<00:02:26.910> yeah<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.140> you're<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
of sense yeah I think if you're in the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.200 
of sense yeah I think if you're in the
music<00:02:28.590> industry<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.430> recording<00:02:29.940> every

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.790 
music industry and like recording every
day<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.810> could<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.290> option<00:02:31.440> for

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
day like this could be a good option for

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.640 
day like this could be a good option for
you<00:02:31.890> or<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> DJ<00:02:32.460> do<00:02:32.820> they<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.350> flyways<00:02:34.350> or

you or a DJ do they have a flyways or
whatever<00:02:34.920> where<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.570> know<00:02:36.630> how

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
whatever where you can be a you know how

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
have these have those but maybe you can

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.510

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.920 
think that if you're a normal human
being<00:03:23.430> who<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:24.000> likes<00:03:24.180> music<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.720> likes

being who really likes music and likes

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.050 
being who really likes music and likes
to<00:03:24.989> listen<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.310> probably<00:03:26.580> get

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
to listen to it you can probably get

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.060 
to listen to it you can probably get
something<00:03:27.390> maybe<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.050> not<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.530> caliber

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
something maybe it's not at this caliber

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.710 
something maybe it's not at this caliber
but<00:03:29.550> it's<00:03:29.700> something<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.150> still<00:03:30.420> noise

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
but it's something that will still noise

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.680
