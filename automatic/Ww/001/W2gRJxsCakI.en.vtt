00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
first of all we had a three wire rig

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.220 
first of all we had a three wire rig
with<00:03:36.730> three<00:03:37.060> minnows<00:03:37.390> on<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.630> we<00:03:37.720> drop<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.110> down

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
with three minnows on it we drop it down

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.680 
with three minnows on it we drop it down
to<00:03:38.410> about<00:03:38.500> 50<00:03:38.980> feet<00:03:39.160> bring<00:03:39.940> up<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> slack<00:03:40.480> -

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
to about 50 feet bring up the slack -

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.110 
to about 50 feet bring up the slack -
the<00:03:40.780> line<00:03:40.989> was<00:03:41.230> tight<00:03:41.560> then<00:03:42.160> we<00:03:42.340> slowly<00:03:42.700> pump

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the line was tight then we slowly pump

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.910 
the line was tight then we slowly pump
our<00:03:43.270> rod<00:03:43.510> up<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.989> down<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.470> rig<00:03:44.650> would<00:03:44.739> just

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
our rod up and down that rig would just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.010 
our rod up and down that rig would just
slowly<00:03:45.160> flow<00:03:45.880> up<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.209> down<00:03:46.390> off<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.720> bottom

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
slowly flow up and down off the bottom

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.140 
slowly flow up and down off the bottom
eventually<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.560> felt<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:48.010> slight<00:03:48.459> tap<00:03:48.880> or

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
eventually you felt a slight tap or

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.820 
eventually you felt a slight tap or
resistance<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.260> knew<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.470> had<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.650> fish

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
resistance and you knew you had a fish

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.280 
resistance and you knew you had a fish
on<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.370> set<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.760> hook<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.170> were

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
on you set the hook and if you were

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.320 
on you set the hook and if you were
smart<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:54.100> let<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> fish<00:03:54.610> swim<00:03:54.880> around<00:03:54.910> down

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
smart you let the fish swim around down

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.640 
smart you let the fish swim around down
there<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.720> little<00:03:55.810> bit<00:03:56.019> usually<00:03:56.230> another

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
there for a little bit usually another

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.710 
there for a little bit usually another
one<00:03:56.890> will<00:03:57.489> hook<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.209> then<00:03:58.599> you'd

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
one will hook on to it and then you'd
