00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.000
 hello to all indeed to begin 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.630
 newspaper well I announce you a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.480
 record 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.730
 a few weeks ago he fell on 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.860
 record of france chamois comes 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.140
 to be taken on February 14th by 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.420
 anthony ovini who just submitted to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.510
 the quote his trophy you see him 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.890
 on this picture a superb trophy that has 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.350
 been taken three months earlier in the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.309
 massif de belledonne in isÃ¨re and which has 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.170
 got the trifle of 130 3.60 cic 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.110
 it's telling you and then during 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.489
 a few months before this 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.290
 quotation ie during the term 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.600
 of drying know that this cat - 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.140
 logically lost two points on the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.840
 listing 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.570
 it's here I was reading by starting this 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.690
 newspaper we will be able to participate in 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.760
 aerial counts two pigeons in 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.230
 indre and loire since the department 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.360
 just like other departments 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.920
 besides, like the Gironde and the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.690
 moors and well participate in these 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.100
 counting by flying over areas 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.369
 wintering and thus allowing 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.830
 birds from trees and then from 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.119
 able to quantify them on a certain 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 a certain surface 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.530
 we immediately look at the report 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.490
 the federation of hunters 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 of indre-et-loire realizes for three 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 years of pigeon aerial counts 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.039
 wood pigeon 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039
 anyway 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 we 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.090
 in coordination with eight others 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 departmental federations of the center of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.220
 Poitou Charentes and South West of the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.530
 la France 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.900
 these counts are done in the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.370
 gif frame 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.930
 the aim is to strengthen the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.780
 knowledge on wintering the pigeon 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.500
 and thus improve our vision of flows 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 migratory in France 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.709
 this index method consists of two 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.140
 times a year flew over simultaneously 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.330
 all of these departments so 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.690
 to get an accurate picture of the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.800
 distribution of overwintering populations 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 so in indre and loire 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.190
 we could observe last winter 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.069
 4900 a pigeon in December and 10750 in 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.200
 January 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.620
 this winter the result is clearly 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.599
 lower with 1255 pigeons in december 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.599
 and 2408 in January 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.690
 these studies will allow hunters 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 in the future to better understand the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.530
 displacement of populations for a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.530
 sustainable management of the species 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.140
 after the pigeons the woodcocks if the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.240
 hunting season is over recently 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.700
 it's time now to participate 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.680
 to the luggage of woodcocks in France 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.210
 metropolitan not less than 91 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.550
 department participate in these operations 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.480
 of banding you are going to see it which 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.340
 represents about 387 people 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 who are licensed authorized to proceed to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.350
 his luggage and for the 2012 campaign 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.230
 2013 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.730
 these landlords have laid more than 6,800 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
 ring it must be known is observed by 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.260
 of 27000 birds of which 400 were 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.060
 captured all this data that 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 actually allow for better 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.770
 to know the bird for this period 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.310
 you have to know that about 990 woodcocks 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.840
 were collected and banded in France 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.130
 but also a hundred abroad 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 especially in russia in spain 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730
 operations that techniques that 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.950
 allow to better know the bird 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 to get notions of abundance but 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.370
 also to calculate their life expectancy 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.130
 to better know the migratory flows 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.640
 of course and their strategy during 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.350
 cold waves 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.250
 let's go to the moors now if 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.500
 you want it when hunters 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.209
 and the non-hunters team up to 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 take care of the birds you know that 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.229
 since the beginning of February 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.280
 and well the storm has hit especially on 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.260
 the Atlantic coast 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.450
 and obviously there are victims 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.470
 especially at the level of the birds we 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.450
 let's go right away on the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.620
 center alca torda which is led by the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.870
 departmental federation of hunters 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.680
 landes which has since acquired 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.870
 number of years a solid 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.610
 experience in managing this type of 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.290
 crisis especially when it comes to tide 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.360
 black or as was the case this 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.130
 year in bird management has 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.200
 saved after this storm 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.700
 we will immediately center 1.14 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.690
 to is a member of the French Union of 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.090
 wildlife preservation centers 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.400
 wild that constitutes a network of 40 and 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.780
 a health center 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.979
 the hundreds of birds heal during 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.690
 of these last two oil spills and 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.310
 the excellent results obtained 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.660
 therefore legitimate and the perpetuation of 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.669
 acquired by the creation of this center 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.860
 unique in place of the old 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.080
 hunting house since its opening 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.880
 in 2005 alca torda greets each 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.220
 year more than 300 animals injured or 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.919
 exhausted most of which are species 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.389
 protected and rare and are realized 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.130
 allow to relax in the environment 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.990
 natural animals or 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.400
 place in specialized structures 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.560
 if their condition does not allow a return to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.030
 the wild life the center alca torda is 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.380
 managed by the Federation of Hunters 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.760
 moors as I hedge them and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.260
 represents an example of the implication 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.120
 hunters for the protection of 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.470
 nature 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.080
 the three main activities of the 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.889
 center care so the whole care part 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.660
 Wildlife 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.419
 it's going to be the general public who is going 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.660
 find a hedgehog a raptor that will have 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.780
 suffered a shock against a car or 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.090
 exhaustion 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.919
 we are in a migration path of 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.400
 a lot of species and actually there 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.660
 a lot of people who weaken go 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.639
 to be found 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.319
 essentially by the general public and 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.849
 they will lead us and we will 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.240
 to make sure that he can find himself 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.910
 freedom 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.320
 little detour to the european parliament 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.270
 indeed the hunters of waterfowl 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.639
 will be satisfied with the amendments 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.009
 radicals who called for the ban on 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.280
 European level of live callers 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:08.320
 could be ruled out thanks to the 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.479
 vigilance of a number of groups 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.620
 of parliamentarians and in particular to 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.509
 this one president of the intergroup 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.460
 hunting at the european parliament veronique 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.770
 mathieu or lyon but also to the 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.630
 vigilance hunters a vote well 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.310
 having read in fact in committee 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.050
 Agriculture in the European parliament it 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.789
 animal health and can be 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.630
 consider it a success for the world 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:30.789
 cynegetic its positive role in 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.139
 cynegetic environments and the monitoring of 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.900
 diseases affecting wild animals 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.389
 and recognized just as the experience and the 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.789
 knowledge that hunters have of these 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.669
 pathologies without any constraint 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.409
 now be imposing on them and we 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.840
 let's finish this diary with a little note 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.880
 flowery if I dare say since it is in 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.280
 the department of the sum that takes place in 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.539
 this moment the operation saona flowers after 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.060
 the operation are clean 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.539
 especially hunters and their 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.300
 partners decided to bloom all 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.560
 the surroundings all the department of the 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.469
 especially around the 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.719
 roundabouts in town or other way 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.580
 to allow and well a better 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.530
 visibility of the action of hunters on 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.199
 the field a good ecological action 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.719
 so by our friends the sum 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:20.070
 see you soon for a new day of the 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.070
 hunting on hunters of france tv
