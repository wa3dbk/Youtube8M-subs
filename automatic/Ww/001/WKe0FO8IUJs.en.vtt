 hello friends welcome to my channel today 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.670
 let's make a chicken in roasted pieces 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.070
 and the ingredients are very simple and 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.140
 If you want to know this recipe we are going to give 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.369
 the ingredients and how it is done 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.619
 we are going to need a mold that is the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.880
 chicken of course although here I already have 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.369
 several pieces I have hips and thighs 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.750
 you are going to use the one you like 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.140
 having or being removed the leather 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.299
 you get the option of or have the option 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.940
 to leave the color and this I leave because 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.900
 my kids like I'm going to season with 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.670
 Salt 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.150
 you can throw two or any 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.650
 person what he has 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:54.180
 I have a union, not the granulated onion 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 I have the granulated garlic 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.940
 pepper finely but it's optional and 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.920
 the unpleasant envelopes with culantro already 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 chopper the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.580
 to take our chicken 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.580
 be sure to cover and not and if you throw 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 Salt care with healthy salt milk in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.540
 so much so that I 'm going to put it here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.890
 but later but that to throw other 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 ingredients 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.260
 my hands are clean of course 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.470
 Chanco oracle and see if they leave the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.250
 leather is thrown underneath 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.250
 a little bit 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.770
 when this was already and I liked it 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.770
 see it with salt 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.939
 the tank 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.300
 I want to let you know that the chicken I 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.280
 I washed very well if I did not wash with vinegar 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.520
 it does not have vinegar and it has lemon it can 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.810
 to know with lemon also or sour orange 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.810
 above below 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.270
 and I'm going to throw it back is my express 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.460
 because they are already lawyers with the area 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.950
 because I did not because drinking 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870
 salt is one thing to see diego being 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.900
 you also what you throw but you have 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.510
 to be very careful because 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.340
 we started with onions does not have 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.700
 none specifically does not matter 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
 garlic 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.600
 also 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.400
 the foundation 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.400
 and it is flying 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 I recommend that you do not cut corners 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.659
 to the chickens and he will do it because if 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.390
 Tajitos the chicken to lose the 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.120
 natural juices and dry lifting 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.140
 I recommend them clearly if the chicken 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.250
 they have serious I have help with these 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 little more pepper 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:16.750
 poor little helper 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.750
 goya reason 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 and now we're going to 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.030
 leave for about average 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.240
 horita and we will take the oven 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.570
 I'm going to preheat 400 and after 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.610
 half an hour we put it in the box 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.410
 they do it with which I went up if 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.410
 they do not want to do it with leathers 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.580
 or that he already spent half an hour 30 minutes and it's 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.370
 I'm going to put mine, I do not know what 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.220
 you can drown the day that better still 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.280
 then take the script or mine is not 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.700
 preheated to 4 to 401 that you know 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.069
 your oven if that does not have much much 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.230
 power then puts it to 350 if not me 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.430
 I 'm going to cook it in 400 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 approximately one hour but 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.430
 I'm going to tell you exactly 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.430
 when I leave it 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.040
 the people 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.270
 and stelades commands that magma is heard 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.439
 all right 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.520
 because one hour has passed my chicken is ok 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.410
 but I do not like my children like that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.330
 they like juice we like that the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.889
 cop coughs and likes to burn well 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.600
 I live so then I'm going to teach him 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.400
 how we like but if 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.540
 you like it that way your chick is already 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.570
 fact 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.669
 one hour ok this is the final result 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.729
 as I told them at the beginning if they want it 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.040
 as well as a little juice or soft what 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.530
 so they take it out when I told the 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.840
 now it depends on your hand and if you want it 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.320
 like christie doradito with the little body 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.320
