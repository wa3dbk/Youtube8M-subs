00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.460
 today we are going to present the nick scepter 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:10.230
 our new general pulse product 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.829
 of injectors pulse generator of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 coil and test of jacques sport east 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.060
 product unlike the version 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.050
 previous since it has a graphic display 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 of 64 x 128 points that allows us not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.300
 just tell them the injection times 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.280
 and so on but also the connections in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.110
 some cases that may be of the 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.110
 different devices to try 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.450
 I think it's the low generation of 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.990
 Foosball sectors the team has 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.570
 three fundamental ways once the 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.210
 normal shot with time 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.680
 one can select the time that 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.920
 wants it to shoot in the sector 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.960
 You can also select the rpm and the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.060
 injection time all this is very 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.950
 easy to change also has the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.800
 synchronous shoots this shoots 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 synchronous is designed to do the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.330
 test of the injectors in the batteries 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.830
 in the testers the vats where one 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.580
 have to measure what is the flow of 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.430
 each sector 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.040
 the pulse senate generates a sweep 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.470
 between a minimum time in maximum time 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.590
 which could be for example between 4 and 15 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.660
 milliseconds and for a while that 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.150
 could be for example 60 seconds or 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.970
 that the team for 60 seconds to 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.300
 go changing the injection course between 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 4 milliseconds to 15 milliseconds in 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.030
 ascending and descending form 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.939
 also of course it has for people 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.429
 which has the cleaning system with 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.630
 feedback the team can generate 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.060
 a pulse of infection in form 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 indefinite means these teams 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.800
 are ready to put up to 6 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 16 nozzles are simultaneously 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.490
 and you want to see more information 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.000
