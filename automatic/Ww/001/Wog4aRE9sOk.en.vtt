short work of the incline check this out
yeah<00:02:16.260> no<00:02:16.709> problem<00:02:25.550> but<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:26.760> goes<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.000> must

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
yeah no problem but what goes up must

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.870 
yeah no problem but what goes up must
come<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.340> use<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.550> hill

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
come down for this we use the hill

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.510 
come down for this we use the hill
descent<00:02:30.090> control<00:02:30.709> now<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.950> should<00:02:32.220> use

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
descent control now this should use

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.920 
descent control now this should use
engine<00:02:33.180> compression<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> ABS<00:02:34.290> system<00:02:34.770> to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
engine compression and the ABS system to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.500 
engine compression and the ABS system to
ease<00:02:36.930> us<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> hill<00:02:37.910> at<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.970> much<00:02:39.330> more

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
ease us down the hill at a much more

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.940 
ease us down the hill at a much more
controlled<00:02:40.019> rate<00:02:40.260> than<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.550> do<00:02:42.950> with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
controlled rate than we can do with

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.470 
controlled rate than we can do with
brakes<00:02:44.220> alone<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.640> system<00:02:51.060> did<00:02:51.269> have<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
brakes alone the system did have a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.910 
brakes alone the system did have a
slight<00:02:51.720> amount<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.290> free<00:02:52.530> roll<00:02:52.739> before

slight amount of free roll before

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.340 
slight amount of free roll before
grabbing<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> did<00:02:54.300> its<00:02:54.450> job<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.930> eased<00:02:55.170> us

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
grabbing but it did its job and eased us

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.660

it's<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.120> unheard<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.600> for<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.840> truck<00:03:22.110> to

it's not unheard of for a truck to

suddenly fall into a submerge hole in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.320 
suddenly fall into a submerge hole in
just<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.930> heap<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.380> water<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.980> boom<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:27.209> now

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
just a heap of water and boom you now

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.580 
just a heap of water and boom you now
have<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> forty-three<00:03:28.140> hundred<00:03:28.200> pound

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.290 

I<00:03:40.220> guess<00:03:41.220> if<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.400> keep<00:03:41.610> throwing<00:03:41.820> rocks<00:03:42.120> it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
I guess if I keep throwing rocks it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.250 
I guess if I keep throwing rocks it
eventually<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.810> high<00:03:42.960> enough<00:03:44.240> if<00:03:45.240> you<00:03:46.020> plan

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
eventually get high enough if you plan

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.080 
eventually get high enough if you plan
on<00:03:46.290> doing<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.740> lot<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.010> hazardous<00:03:47.580> travel<00:03:47.790> an

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
on doing a lot of hazardous travel an

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.360 
on doing a lot of hazardous travel an

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
investment in a snorkel system would be

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.199 
investment in a snorkel system would be
money<00:03:50.610> well<00:03:50.940> spent

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:13.000 

really<00:03:55.209> need

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.070

this oh yeah that ladies and gentlemen

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.770 
this oh yeah that ladies and gentlemen
is<00:04:58.280> what<00:04:58.520> separates<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.090> boys<00:04:59.180> from<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.750> men

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
is what separates the boys from the men

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
and crossovers from real trucks if you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.100 
and crossovers from real trucks if you
want<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.400> go<00:05:04.490> into<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:04.910> wild<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.660> level<00:05:06.020> of

want to go into the wild that level of
travel<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.650> mandatory<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:12.050> course<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.440> would

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
travel is mandatory of course it would

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.110 
travel is mandatory of course it would
also<00:05:12.680> help<00:05:12.949> to<00:05:13.160> have<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.310> driver<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.729> had<00:05:13.970> any

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
also help to have a driver that had any

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.969 
also help to have a driver that had any
idea<00:05:14.479> what<00:05:14.630> they<00:05:14.750> were<00:05:14.810> doing<00:05:14.870> but<00:05:15.710> that's<00:05:15.830> a

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
idea what they were doing but that's a

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:24.250 
idea what they were doing but that's a
different<00:05:16.130> topic<00:05:16.280> but<00:05:23.050> when<00:05:24.050> would<00:05:24.229> you

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
different topic but when would you

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.820 
different topic but when would you
really<00:05:24.919> need<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.280> locking<00:05:25.880> differential

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
really need a locking differential

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.530 
really need a locking differential
possibly<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.130> get<00:05:28.460> in<00:05:28.610> say<00:05:29.030> over<00:05:29.389> your
