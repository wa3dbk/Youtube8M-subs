important<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.489> more<00:02:32.670> special<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.450> way<00:02:33.629> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
important it's more special that way and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.990 
important it's more special that way and
that's<00:02:34.379> how<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.560> write<00:02:34.859> like<00:02:35.189> it<00:02:35.340> takes<00:02:35.579> me<00:02:35.819> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's how I write like it takes me it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.379 
that's how I write like it takes me it
takes<00:02:36.530> after<00:02:37.530> each<00:02:37.739> song<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.670> literally<00:02:39.060> like

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
takes after each song I'm literally like

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.619 
takes after each song I'm literally like
I've<00:02:39.810> lost<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:41.219> a<00:02:41.549> piece<00:02:41.849> of<00:02:41.879> meat<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:42.599> I

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
I've lost like a piece of meat because I

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.839 
I've lost like a piece of meat because I
put<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.049> into<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.439> song<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.579> hard<00:02:44.790> for

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
put it into that song so it's hard for

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.460 
put it into that song so it's hard for
me<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> like<00:02:45.420> give<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.470> away<00:02:46.669> um<00:02:47.989> but<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.139> write
