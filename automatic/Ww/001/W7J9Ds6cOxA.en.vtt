00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 This is a better player to talk to outside, she said in three variations 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.269
 as here is the piste 3 twenty namely three residents 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.710
 and one she ended up as it stands here it is the 2h20 that has two 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.650
 Dutch and they burn and that site also in the third variant that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.440
 namely with 2 10 then he has no said bram to study work so off and on 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.070
 nice of that model is that offer showed that the rose 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.169
 who can win hits 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.039
 The power between these three models is of course also different from this one with 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.730
 the cdu that we would otherwise be allowed in the three twenties of twelve could have nine kilowatts 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.149
 this the 2h20 with two fires put power eleven bowls three kilowatts and the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 two teenagers a power of seven come March 18 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.260
 see the operation of the spurter classics 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is infinitely variable 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.519
 you can set a bon jovi how hot your mail is 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.240
 and nice to put the buttons with your fingertips home 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 so if you have greasy fingers, but he slides tomorrow m 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.620
 vultures roar inflammation is easy for those who can burn you 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.620
 set the temperature yourself 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 on the lid 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.410
 this bench has two side trays with brackets on the sides for it 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.080
 tool 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 and the three 20 and the two 20 who have also ended up sitting on it and that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.439
 sits on the left and also work here 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.100
 choose the tool this year 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 operate bkr trappers with the rotary knob 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 also put kana with the ignition 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 he no longer has the porcelain lattices and the ball became ten warbout 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.320
 also grill top sandwich or pony meat to keep warm 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.990
 below this the porcelain and give you the grids there are also the meat products 6 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.110
 no more 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.410
 ideal because here 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.830
 namely, it falls on the sale of the meat and that every burned whatsoever and 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.060
 that gives the level reading 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.780
 extras 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.650
 They make beautiful and could be set by DJ 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.670
 what we live 60 fights 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.729
 lvs sit down afterwards 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.319
 and beautiful the weaver is that all is a whole so it was the reintjes 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.509
 easy for cleaning and that is law that falls a kidney in the big 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.240
 collection bin through the hole 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.959
 to the small collection bin 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.479
 at the front the incident apx endex screen faces nicely 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.580
 easy to pick up 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.299
 therein is the gas bottle 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.719
 more the five kilograms of meat and, in addition, super-fat tray in addition to a large one 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.049
 Mac sales therefore also to every franky de graeve schoemaker 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:25.939
 local residents 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.280
 small to sit tray with which already have a mini 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.830
 containers here just from us as an accessory can obtain that would be 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.430
 usual because then you have to clean the riots in it is now 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.700
 for convenience and this warm so that on the viruses and kelis men 2 also one 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.739
 have cream and that way you can have this 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.499
 in the shed 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.499
 because to put the garage 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.639
 and already available the afm unemployment 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.360
 this way, this barbecue stays 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.309
 I think the star is also in top condition on the side 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.359
 is velcro fastener 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.669
 are there nice and tight because that way with device that from 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.139
 and when you stand outside 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.139
 at this bank in top condition 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.119
 he knows what do you really think about quality because it is wider 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:15.430
 give ten years more 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.530
 on the benches also the lid and on the campsite and on the outside kitchen they even 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.130
 also on the ps3 s brammertz and another nice advantage of weber is that five years 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.129
 after the purchase all parts are still available 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.119
 délégee almost tripled by those in need of grylls pepe next time 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.870
 that you leave a nice big piece of meat 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.960
 turning it around is not a pretty grove and then everything happens 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.869
 the mechanism 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.569
 there are also too many more accessories available for the spit so that you 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
 much more to do with it 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.729
 The great thing about a weaver's barbecue is that you indirectly turn into a hoot 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.169
 want it immediately 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.030
 is that your product is above 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.680
 so put the heat source above the briquettes around the charcoal and with 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.100
 indirectly screaming actually makes a convection oven for the barbecue 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.860
 three points 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.940
 or the charcoal that is completely on the sides then the with the valve 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.829
 closed so that you show first 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.319
 constant temperature 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.109
 one met 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.919
 and with a gas barbecue staff you could handle the heat through the burners 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.440
 what you had to do with this video girls not on a diving team 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.110
 to click 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.529
 or that you share with your friends or groups of people 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.909
 the in a van 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.740
 click here on the ordered 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.150
 although clickable the you go through the page 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.910
 I think then unfortunately product is I just say on weeks
