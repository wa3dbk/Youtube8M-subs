00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.840 
gonna be an entirely new track there's
nothing<00:01:15.440> there<00:01:15.619> right<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.250> it's<00:01:16.430> we're

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
nothing there right now and it's we're

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.490 
nothing there right now and it's we're
definitely<00:01:17.180> kind<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:17.750> looking<00:01:18.050> for<00:01:18.200> something

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
definitely kind of looking for something

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.170 
definitely kind of looking for something
new<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:18.860> point<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.220> think<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:19.789> event

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
new at this point I think this event

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.600 
new at this point I think this event
could<00:01:20.479> be<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.990> next<00:01:21.229> kind<00:01:21.649> of<00:01:21.740> classic<00:01:22.280> for

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
could be the next kind of classic for

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.969 
could be the next kind of classic for
all<00:01:23.270> these<00:01:23.720> athletes<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.560> think<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.860> really

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
all these athletes and I think it really

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.830 
all these athletes and I think it really
could<00:01:25.280> kind<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.490> be<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> new<00:01:25.910> chapter<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.600> not

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
could kind of be a new chapter and not

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:36.430 
could kind of be a new chapter and not
bike<00:01:27.080> racing
