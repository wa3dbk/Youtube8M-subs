Michigan of sandy sides would have sandy

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.390 
Michigan of sandy sides would have sandy
sandy<00:01:18.520> soils<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:19.900> pretty<00:01:20.680> unique<00:01:20.860> farm

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
sandy soils this is a pretty unique farm

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.940 
sandy soils this is a pretty unique farm
where<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.760> have<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> lot<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.270> clay<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:22.960> it

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
where we have a lot of clay and it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.920 
where we have a lot of clay and it
depends<00:01:24.220> on<00:01:24.340> also<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.790> varietals<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.750> you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
depends on also the varietals that you

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.910 
depends on also the varietals that you
use<00:01:26.830> for<00:01:27.670> your<00:01:28.300> wine<00:01:29.050> production<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.770> then

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
use for your wine production and then

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.040 
use for your wine production and then
the<00:01:30.070> root<00:01:30.250> stocks<00:01:30.610> on<00:01:30.820> these<00:01:31.270> soils<00:01:31.690> because

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
the root stocks on these soils because

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.890 
the root stocks on these soils because
that<00:01:32.470> will<00:01:32.620> all<00:01:32.800> influence<00:01:33.630> ultimately<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
that will all influence ultimately the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.940 
that will all influence ultimately the
quality<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:36.040> wine<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.970> aromatic

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
quality of the wine and the aromatic

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.160 
quality of the wine and the aromatic
compounds<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.490> your<00:01:39.670> Enclave<00:01:40.060> pretty<00:01:41.020> much

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
compounds so your Enclave pretty much

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
compounds so your Enclave pretty much
clay<00:01:41.470> yeah

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.910 

I<00:01:47.899> thought<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> nice<00:01:49.469> winery

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I thought that was a nice winery

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.109 
I thought that was a nice winery
brand-new<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.710> tasted<00:01:53.220> four<00:01:53.759> different

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
brand-new that we tasted four different

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.330 
brand-new that we tasted four different
lines<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.310> thought<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.850> Chardonnay<00:01:57.509> was

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
lines and I thought the Chardonnay was

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.950 
lines and I thought the Chardonnay was
one<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> most<00:02:00.000> unique<00:02:00.240> chardonnays<00:02:00.780> I've

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
one of the most unique chardonnays I've

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.740 
one of the most unique chardonnays I've
ever<00:02:01.110> had
