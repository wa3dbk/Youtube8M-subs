theory on I'm able to go for the ice
cream<00:03:32.480> because<00:03:32.600> what<00:03:33.019> he<00:03:33.260> did<00:03:33.530> was<00:03:33.769> he<00:03:33.800> played

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
cream because what he did was he played

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.370 
cream because what he did was he played
it<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.550> little<00:03:34.940> bit<00:03:35.209> risky<00:03:35.600> there<00:03:35.780> he<00:03:36.019> went<00:03:36.200> for

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
it a little bit risky there he went for

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.259 
it a little bit risky there he went for
the<00:03:36.440> source<00:03:36.739> hands<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.220> he<00:03:37.760> probably<00:03:38.030> just

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the source hands and he probably just

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.030 
the source hands and he probably just
thought<00:03:38.450> i<00:03:38.480> had<00:03:38.720> moonblast<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.860> uh

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
thought i had moonblast and that's it uh

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.640 
thought i had moonblast and that's it uh
yeah<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.120> don't<00:03:41.450> have<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:41.959> dazzling<00:03:42.410> gleam

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
yeah I don't have that or dazzling gleam

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.789 
yeah I don't have that or dazzling gleam
whatever<00:03:43.010> i'm<00:03:43.310> able<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.880> go<00:03:44.420> off<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.049> not<00:03:45.290> be

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
whatever i'm able to go off and not be

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.620 
whatever i'm able to go off and not be
able<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.070> get<00:03:46.310> off<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.519> ice<00:03:46.670> be<00:03:46.880> very<00:03:47.360> helpful

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
able to get off the ice be very helpful

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.120 
able to get off the ice be very helpful
there<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.140> i<00:03:48.260> was<00:03:48.350> able<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.680> get<00:03:48.799> rid<00:03:49.100> of

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
there because i was able to get rid of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.620 
there because i was able to get rid of
laters<00:03:49.489> if<00:03:49.700> i<00:03:49.820> didn't<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.480> now

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
laters if i didn't have that now

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.060 
laters if i didn't have that now
probably<00:03:50.989> would<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.290> lost<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.650> game<00:03:51.830> and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
probably would have lost the game and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.770 
probably would have lost the game and
then<00:03:52.640> he's<00:03:52.790> gonna<00:03:52.880> bring<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.239> his<00:03:53.360> new<00:03:53.510> friend

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
then he's gonna bring in his new friend

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.449 
then he's gonna bring in his new friend
all<00:03:53.930> he's<00:03:54.080> gonna<00:03:54.230> do<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.470> he's<00:03:54.709> gonna<00:03:54.980> try<00:03:55.310> and

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
all he's gonna do is he's gonna try and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.420 
all he's gonna do is he's gonna try and
trick<00:03:55.670> me<00:03:55.700> um<00:03:56.620> my<00:03:57.620> item<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.100> all<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.280> but
