00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.650 
Joe 80 may be off look that up when I do
that<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.710> username<00:00:35.100> no<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.360> did

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that but there's your username no I did

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310 
that but there's your username no I did
I've<00:00:36.870> done<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> before<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I've done this before it would be the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.209 
I've done this before it would be the
best<00:00:40.530> way<00:00:41.840> probably<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:45.829> plus<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.980> could

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
best way probably like this plus I could

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.100 
best way probably like this plus I could
hold<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.000> doubt<00:00:48.059> it'll<00:00:48.420> work<00:00:51.110> like

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
hold it up but I doubt it'll work like

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
hold it up but I doubt it'll work like
this<00:00:52.940> automatic<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this automatic like this actually I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
this automatic like this actually I
think<00:00:54.960> would<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.180> could<00:00:57.180> go

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
think would just go like this I could go

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
think would just go like this I could go
like<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.079> sense<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.670> glooog

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
like this that make sense we have glooog

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.759 
like this that make sense we have glooog
our<00:01:00.379> vespiquen<00:01:02.180> fortress<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.690> Miss<00:01:04.559> Maggie
