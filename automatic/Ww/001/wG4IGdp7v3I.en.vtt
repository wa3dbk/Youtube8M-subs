 why do you need a service 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.930
 for raids because he went out to not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.480
 become all people who break the rules 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.300
 traffic provocateurs given 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.280
 the case will be how how displayed as 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.280
 and express so fasten 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.030
 and let's write the protocol so don't 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.190
 break let's write the protocol well 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.990
 let's write a protocol tube ru 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.180
 let's write a protocol drove on 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.950
 red let's carry evidence and 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 we will write a protocol very problem 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 saw that they are constantly dreaming 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.509
 i don't just do it on purpose 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 constantly I don't do it on purpose 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.429
 constant be broken stupidly carry 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.090
 responsibility write protocol no why 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:14.040
 generally stops it is impossible not just 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.239
 so we will not show the protocol sakesh 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.840
 just not show why just 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.840
 show 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.690
 but I don't see you at all 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.160
 we looked you further 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.040
 change your mind and noisy 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.490
 and enter the protocol at the same time we find out if not 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.240
 they could not see 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.240
 why do we go there covered 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.170
 they saw their own people exactly the same 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 delivered I think 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.190
 so why look at them 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.140

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.560
 plastic rules 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.340
 you don't have plastic 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.340

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.629
 such a desire to look at my documents 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.629
 we will look at protocols 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.450
