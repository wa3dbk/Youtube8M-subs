00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hey guys what's up i show you today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.410
 still my news award specifically on the 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.490
 piano related and I have that now 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.490
 normal piano on it 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.700
 that sounds like that 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.160
 that was all the most now 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.890
 You played her people perhaps without 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.000
 it is not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 There are a few rules of music that 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 simply the distances must agree that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.760
 I then normal for us again 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 I can now listen to it for example 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.110
 but that would be the goal in the beginning 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110
 I play like this 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.620
 since the distances are again as from c 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.089
 on d and dfb and on it 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.010
 heartily that we have a ca 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.140
 for you now not so much with you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.210
 before that normal heard but it 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.980
 did not deliver and that can stop 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.269
 at any note i do 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.269
 can now also at the beginning 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.380
 and still not wrong 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 but as the notes are basically 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.329
 That's what I want you to do here 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.659
 I found the picture on google 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:29.380
 that it is really very helpful there 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.869
 then simply eg where c4 is this can be a 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.209
 help if you make songs after 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.729
 if you want to hear a song, for example 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:39.069
 or sees on youtube as the most 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.599
 piano show how that is played can 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.340
 Just think it over and listen to the piano 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.099
 I have already played with many of them 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 Now my new song is done 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.610
 over the gate 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.610
 I also took that in and added it 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.200
 I'll show you with the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.420
 quantification and everything is possible 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.230
 of course, how better to understand that 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.920
 itself 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.970
 because if not for this same time 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 Come on then it will be fine 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.790
 different again 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.210
 because the sets like I added 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.210
 have 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.310
 yes and then I have pressed yes therefore 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.110
 and at the end made a few more faxes 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.200
 In any case, it's all about the idea 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.990
 just a piano to look at 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.970
 to see the notes and then that on the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.140
 land sister is transferred to you 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.240
 pretty hard needs a bit 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.920
 time to learn that, but at some point 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.640
 make it click and then it fits 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.410
 know once 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.900
 the distance between the notes is that 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.580
 So important c then there is a 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.610
 black zero he does not play on 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.110
 the launchpad I can not someone 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.820
 show piano then you see something 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.800
 they mean 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.130
 should you know about the piano? 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 otherwise you can throw away your launchpad 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.580
 So draw then the note is free 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 then again a black and red free then 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.740
 and eleven that no note black users 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.330
 the idea goes on in between 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.310
 I already have it 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.560
 implement and just repeat and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.540
 repeat that is really the a and o's 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.540
 a manifest when you have practiced for a long time 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.989
 Of course it often mistakes because it 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.120
 just not the piano is where you are 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.640
 what can do and there it is 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 No, practice practicing here 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.799
 maybe now that amused 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.079
 It starts here then until after that 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.400
 then go back to the boys again 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.049
 then go on up here 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.510
 I continue to observe me, saying, 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:07.209
 it then the note to the note 1 lime 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.340
 the note 1, note if ye here with 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.410
 The cock then you have everything 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:18.400
 right 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:21.400
 cdefgh cdefgh cdefgh h 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.430
 then you always know from 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.590
 Often you have to clean it from e to 11 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 you have to do it directly without one 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.060
 platzhalter go is then always in 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.150
 this series is always the same when I am 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.300
 eg here is not the c-youth of the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.300
 row the fdp 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.300
 dfk so I hope that now reasonably 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.310
 understood and imst also implement at 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.470
