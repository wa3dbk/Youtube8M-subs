00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.270 

then<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.340> got<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:52.460> for<00:00:53.460> Gage<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:55.280> i'm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
then I got from them for Gage and i'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
then I got from them for Gage and i'm
going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> set<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> down<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
going to set this down I'm going to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
going to set this down I'm going to
pause<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.809> i<00:00:58.850> know<00:00:59.850> i<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.359> could

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
pause it i know i don't think i could

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
pause it i know i don't think i could
posit<00:01:00.899> i'm<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> phone<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.910> continuous<00:01:04.760> okay<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
posit i'm a phone and continuous okay so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.940 
posit i'm a phone and continuous okay so

here's a sub XFL 1544 American base

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
here's a sub XFL 1544 American base
thousand<00:01:11.540> thousand<00:01:12.540> rms<00:01:12.869> 2000<00:01:13.650> max<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
dual voice coil and as you can see I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.600 
dual voice coil and as you can see I
started<00:01:19.500> wearing<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
started wearing it because it's going to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
started wearing it because it's going to
be<00:01:20.729> impossible<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.330> hold<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.810> while<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
be impossible to hold this while I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
be impossible to hold this while I
actually<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> take

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
actually do it so I'm just going to take

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually do it so I'm just going to take
you<00:01:24.930> step<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.229> step<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.909> gauge<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you step by step this is for gauge it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620 
you step by step this is for gauge it
barely<00:01:27.509> even<00:01:27.720> fit<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:29.000> mean<00:01:30.000> eight<00:01:30.210> gauges

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
barely even fit so I mean eight gauges

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
barely even fit so I mean eight gauges
find<00:01:31.259> 16<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.009> even<00:01:32.250> fine<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.790> using<00:01:32.939> regular

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
find 16 is even fine i was using regular

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
find 16 is even fine i was using regular
speaker<00:01:33.689> wire<00:01:33.840> before<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.650> most

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
speaker wire before which is what most

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.760 
speaker wire before which is what most
people<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.640> doesn't<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.630> i<00:01:36.960> mean<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
people use it doesn't really i mean it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.420 
people use it doesn't really i mean it
matters<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.700> huge<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:40.430> mostly

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
matters but it's not huge I mostly

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
matters but it's not huge I mostly
wanted<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.240> amp<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.470> new

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
wanted this for my amp but I got new

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
wanted this for my amp but I got new
wiring<00:01:44.040> since<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.799> anyways<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.880> go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wiring since then but anyways you go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
wiring since then but anyways you go
positive<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> positive<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:50.159> going

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
positive to positive and then I'm going

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.530 
positive to positive and then I'm going
to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.460> negative<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.909> negative<00:01:50.939> i'm<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to do negative to negative i'm going to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.209 
to do negative to negative i'm going to
do<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> come<00:01:52.439> back

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.370 

okay<00:01:56.219> i'm<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.969> fixed<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> positive<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
okay i'm back i fixed the positive a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.080 
okay i'm back i fixed the positive a
little<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
little bit and now you see a the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.639 
little bit and now you see a the
negative<00:02:00.920> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> other<00:02:02.610> negative

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
negative going to the other negative

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
negative going to the other negative
make<00:02:04.649> sure<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.130> they're<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:06.000> tight

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
make sure you know they're pretty tight

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.139 
make sure you know they're pretty tight
they're<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> fall<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.110> because

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
they're not going to fall off because

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.080 
they're not going to fall off because
sounds<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> lot<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.739> movement<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.970> what

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
sounds make a lot of movement then what

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.580 
sounds make a lot of movement then what
you're<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> amp

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you're going to do with the amp

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.630 
you're going to do with the amp
which<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.800> won't<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.160> able<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> show<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
which I won't be able to show you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.180

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
because it's dark what we're going to do

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.160
