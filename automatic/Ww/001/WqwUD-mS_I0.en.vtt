00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it was real close to that I ended up

getting fifty one coin purses so we're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.880 
getting fifty one coin purses so we're
going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> end<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.380> getting<00:00:28.769> out

going to see what I end up getting out
of<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:29.699> perhaps<00:00:30.119> maybe<00:00:30.539> how<00:00:30.750> much

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
of this and then perhaps maybe how much

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.330 
of this and then perhaps maybe how much
it's<00:00:31.109> worth<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.920> I'll<00:00:32.040> go<00:00:32.160> into

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it's worth I don't know if I'll go into

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.299 
it's worth I don't know if I'll go into
that<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.079> here<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.250> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that but here we go so I know a lot of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490

people<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.850> were<00:00:39.090> asking<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.840> rotations

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
people to were asking about my rotations

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.760 
people to were asking about my rotations
that<00:00:40.590> i<00:00:40.739> use<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.250> PvE<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:43.230> something<00:00:43.590> like

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that i use in PvE for something like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.770 
that i use in PvE for something like
this<00:00:43.950> where<00:00:44.219> I'm<00:00:44.309> only<00:00:44.460> fighting<00:00:44.789> level<00:00:45.239> 41

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this where I'm only fighting level 41

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
this where I'm only fighting level 41
basically<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.980> used<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.460> abilities<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:48.149> use

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
basically I used two abilities i use

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
basically I used two abilities i use
freezing<00:00:48.719> arrow<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.860> i<00:00:49.950> use<00:00:50.100> flame<00:00:50.399> but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
freezing arrow and then i use flame but

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
freezing arrow and then i use flame but
other<00:00:51.329> than<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.199> try<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> stay<00:00:52.649> away<00:00:52.739> from

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
other than that I try to stay away from

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
other than that I try to stay away from
anything<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> burns<00:00:54.600> mana<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.350> mean<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
anything that burns mana I mean if you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.319 
anything that burns mana I mean if you
happen<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> pull<00:00:56.460> three<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.820> four<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> time

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
happen to pull three or four at a time

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
happen to pull three or four at a time
then<00:00:57.719> feel<00:00:57.989> free<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:59.100> whatever<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.609> want

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
then feel free to use whatever you want

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590 
then feel free to use whatever you want
to<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> meantime<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:02.210> when<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to in the meantime but when I'm just

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
to in the meantime but when I'm just
grinding<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> seeing<00:01:04.559> how<00:01:04.680> many<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.949> grind

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
grinding and seeing how many I can grind

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
grinding and seeing how many I can grind
out<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> given<00:01:06.720> amount<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
out in a given amount of time then I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.260 
out in a given amount of time then I
don't<00:01:08.510> necessarily<00:01:09.510> worry<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
don't necessarily worry about it i just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.590 
don't necessarily worry about it i just
used<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.689> low<00:01:13.200> man<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.530> one's<00:01:13.860> by<00:01:14.220> using

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
used the low man on one's by using

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
used the low man on one's by using
freezing<00:01:15.600> arrow<00:01:15.810> nothing<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.530> gets<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
freezing arrow nothing really gets to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.010 
freezing arrow nothing really gets to
you<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> worry<00:01:18.330> about

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.399 

losing<00:01:22.020> health<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.900> my

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
losing health and the way that I have my

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.160 
losing health and the way that I have my
skill<00:01:26.369> set<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> mana<00:01:27.750> regen

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
skill set up for all the mana regen

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.340 
skill set up for all the mana regen
extra<00:01:34.159> amounts<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.280> mana<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.350> using

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
extra amounts of mana and then using

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
extra amounts of mana and then using
less<00:01:37.530> mana<00:01:37.770> /<00:01:37.979> ability<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.729> able<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
less mana / ability I'm able to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
less mana / ability I'm able to
basically<00:01:39.750> grind<00:01:40.409> through<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> whole<00:01:40.890> thing

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
basically grind through the whole thing

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
basically grind through the whole thing
without<00:01:42.259> worrying<00:01:43.259> about<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.649> too<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:44.479> let's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
without worrying about it too much let's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.940 
without worrying about it too much let's
see<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.990> end<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.259> getting<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.740> this

see what we end up getting here this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.200 
see what we end up getting here this
actually<00:01:47.159> looks<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.030> haul

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
actually looks like a pretty good haul

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
actually looks like a pretty good haul
for<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> half<00:01:48.780> hour<00:01:49.640> I'll<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
for a half hour I'll take it to the

for a half hour I'll take it to the
option<00:01:52.229> house<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.619> soon<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.890> we're<00:01:53.040> done<00:01:53.070> here

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
but that's such a rarity usually you're

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.310 
but that's such a rarity usually you're
going<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.760> get<00:02:09.820> about<00:02:10.030> six<00:02:10.360> silver<00:02:10.600> /<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:11.200> if

you figure that out for 50 it's about

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.160 
you figure that out for 50 it's about
three<00:02:13.420> gold<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.120> gain<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.540> three<00:02:16.930> gold

especially with the roar coming out and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.590 
especially with the roar coming out and
the<00:02:45.160> fact<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.430> i<00:02:45.550> want<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.790> get<00:02:45.910> some<00:02:46.090> land<00:02:46.390> up

the fact that i want to get some land up

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.530 
the fact that i want to get some land up
there<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.050> get<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.440> all<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:48.210> i'd<00:02:49.210> like<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
there and get that all going i'd like to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.420 
there and get that all going i'd like to
stay<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.110> roar<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.710> most<00:02:50.920> part<00:02:51.160> for

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
stay in a roar for the most part for

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.300 
stay in a roar for the most part for
everything<00:02:51.880> after<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
everything after this so that is the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.350 
everything after this so that is the
plan<00:02:54.550> for<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.950> too<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.240> were

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
plan for that I think too if you were

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.510 
plan for that I think too if you were
grinding<00:02:58.570> out<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> coin<00:02:59.739> versus<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.340> could

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
grinding out the coin versus you could

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.430 
grinding out the coin versus you could
probably<00:03:00.910> go<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> little<00:03:01.600> bit<00:03:01.810> faster<00:03:01.989> than<00:03:02.320> me

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
probably go a little bit faster than me

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
probably go a little bit faster than me
if<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.709> did<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> full<00:03:03.730> set<00:03:04.030> up<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.600> take

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
if you did a full set up just to take

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.330 
if you did a full set up just to take
those<00:03:05.020> out<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.739> take<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.070> Bears

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
those out I know you can take the Bears

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.430 
those out I know you can take the Bears
and<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.700> Bears<00:03:06.940> are<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.300> lot<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.690> areas<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
and the Bears are in a lot of areas the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.600 
and the Bears are in a lot of areas the
reason<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.800> they're<00:03:09.070> nice<00:03:09.280> just<00:03:09.520> because

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
reason that they're nice just because

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.449 
reason that they're nice just because
they're<00:03:09.880> full<00:03:10.209> melee<00:03:10.660> damage<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.470> with

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
they're full melee damage so with

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.520 
they're full melee damage so with
freezing<00:03:12.820> arrow<00:03:13.180> they<00:03:13.540> typically<00:03:14.080> don't<00:03:14.230> even

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
freezing arrow they typically don't even

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.170 
freezing arrow they typically don't even
make<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.100> by<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.430> time<00:03:15.850> that<00:03:18.180> they're

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
make it to you by the time that they're

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630 
make it to you by the time that they're
dead<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.690> can<00:03:20.080> just<00:03:20.260> use<00:03:20.410> my<00:03:20.590> auto<00:03:20.739> attack<00:03:21.130> ones

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640

take<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.290> bots<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.739> there's<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.459> no

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
take out the bots and there's really no

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.130 
take out the bots and there's really no
problems<00:03:43.060> there

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.860 

alright<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.880> we<00:03:47.090> are<00:03:47.120> almost<00:03:47.390> here<00:03:47.690> if<00:03:47.810> I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
alright so we are almost here if I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.840 
alright so we are almost here if I
remember<00:03:48.319> right<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.500> option<00:03:48.920> airs<00:03:49.160> over<00:03:49.490> here

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.890 

and<00:03:52.850> let's<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.870> what<00:03:54.080> we<00:03:54.260> gained<00:03:54.590> out<00:03:54.830> of<00:03:55.040> this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
and let's see what we gained out of this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:05.180 
and let's see what we gained out of this
so<00:03:57.220> that's<00:03:58.220> basically<00:03:58.459> nothing

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.520 

I'm<00:04:06.030> starting<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> lower<00:04:06.960> stuff<00:04:07.350> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm starting with a lower stuff of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.410 
I'm starting with a lower stuff of
course<00:04:07.710> first<00:04:08.040> that's<00:04:08.550> nothing<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.510> me<00:04:11.420> this

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
course first that's nothing to me this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.740 
course first that's nothing to me this
is<00:04:12.570> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.870> pretty<00:04:13.020> cheap<00:04:13.350> as<00:04:13.530> well<00:04:14.750> 33

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
is going to be pretty cheap as well 33

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.200 
is going to be pretty cheap as well 33
on<00:04:16.410> that

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.190 

the<00:04:22.210> rest<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.540> stuff<00:04:22.750> should<00:04:22.960> be<00:04:22.990> worth

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the rest of the stuff should be worth

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.110 
the rest of the stuff should be worth
money<00:04:23.410> all<00:04:23.770> right<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:24.160> there's<00:04:24.370> three<00:04:24.940> more

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
money all right so there's three more

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:48.030 
money all right so there's three more
gold<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.630> we're<00:04:25.780> up<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.050> about<00:04:26.080> six<00:04:26.770> now

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:05:01.610 

so<00:04:48.640> seventeen<00:04:49.270> gold<00:04:49.540> with<00:04:49.750> that

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.890 

28<00:05:02.620> gold

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
28 gold

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.980 
28 gold
Oh

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:20.439 

so<00:05:12.710> altogether

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.330 

we're<00:05:21.050> looking<00:05:21.319> at<00:05:21.409> about<00:05:21.499> thirty<00:05:21.860> one<00:05:22.099> gold

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
we're looking at about thirty one gold

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.679 
we're looking at about thirty one gold
and<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.580> half<00:05:22.729> hour<00:05:24.759> which<00:05:25.759> isn't<00:05:25.939> bad<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.569> have

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
and a half hour which isn't bad you have

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.179 
and a half hour which isn't bad you have
to<00:05:26.809> remember<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.259> can<00:05:27.379> only<00:05:27.439> do<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.009> much

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
to remember you can only do it so much

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:29.649 
to remember you can only do it so much
in<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.400> day<00:05:28.610> because<00:05:28.879> you<00:05:28.999> need<00:05:29.150> five<00:05:29.330> labour

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
in a day because you need five labour

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.559 
in a day because you need five labour
points<00:05:30.110> in<00:05:30.229> order<00:05:30.499> to<00:05:30.620> do<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.889> so<00:05:31.569> technically

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
points in order to do it so technically

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.029 
points in order to do it so technically
I<00:05:32.719> think<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:33.139> you<00:05:33.259> figure<00:05:33.559> it<00:05:33.710> out<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.009> can

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
I think if you figure it out you can

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:41.920 
I think if you figure it out you can
gain<00:05:36.189> 2,400<00:05:37.189> I<00:05:37.520> believe<00:05:39.699> or<00:05:40.699> 2,800<00:05:41.539> maybe<00:05:41.779> it

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
gain 2,400 I believe or 2,800 maybe it

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.640 
gain 2,400 I believe or 2,800 maybe it
is<00:05:42.050> yeah<00:05:42.699> so<00:05:43.699> you<00:05:43.789> can<00:05:43.909> gain<00:05:44.439> basically<00:05:45.439> you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
is yeah so you can gain basically you

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.959 
is yeah so you can gain basically you
can<00:05:45.830> gain<00:05:48.009> 10<00:05:49.009> labour<00:05:49.219> points<00:05:49.580> every<00:05:49.759> five

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
can gain 10 labour points every five

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.339 
can gain 10 labour points every five
minutes<00:05:50.270> which<00:05:50.539> an<00:05:50.659> hour<00:05:50.809> is<00:05:51.110> 120<00:05:52.599> so<00:05:53.599> in<00:05:53.900> 24

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
minutes which an hour is 120 so in 24

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.989 
minutes which an hour is 120 so in 24
hours<00:05:54.379> if<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:54.800> were<00:05:54.919> logged<00:05:55.099> in<00:05:55.339> the<00:05:55.520> entire

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
hours if you were logged in the entire

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.760 
hours if you were logged in the entire
time<00:05:56.389> you<00:05:57.080> would<00:05:57.319> gain<00:05:57.589> I<00:05:57.979> believe<00:05:58.550> 2,800<00:05:59.770> plus

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
time you would gain I believe 2,800 plus

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.499 
time you would gain I believe 2,800 plus
if<00:06:01.009> you<00:06:01.159> use<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:01.430> two<00:06:02.150> workers<00:06:03.009> compensation

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
if you use the two workers compensation

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.059 
if you use the two workers compensation
potions<00:06:05.509> during<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.080> time<00:06:06.379> then<00:06:06.710> you<00:06:06.860> could

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
potions during that time then you could

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.469 
potions during that time then you could
technically<00:06:07.789> gain<00:06:08.150> 4800<00:06:09.050> dena<00:06:09.349> in<00:06:10.069> a<00:06:10.219> day

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
technically gain 4800 dena in a day

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.320 
technically gain 4800 dena in a day
which<00:06:11.479> then<00:06:11.719> means<00:06:11.930> you<00:06:12.229> could<00:06:12.469> use<00:06:13.069> you<00:06:13.580> could

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
which then means you could use you could

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.070 
which then means you could use you could
do<00:06:14.509> like<00:06:14.689> 900<00:06:15.289> in<00:06:15.409> some<00:06:16.330> coin<00:06:17.330> purses<00:06:17.599> per<00:06:17.930> day

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
do like 900 in some coin purses per day

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.809 
do like 900 in some coin purses per day
but<00:06:18.139> that's<00:06:18.710> as<00:06:18.889> many<00:06:19.039> as<00:06:19.159> you<00:06:19.279> can<00:06:19.370> do<00:06:19.520> it<00:06:19.669> does

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
but that's as many as you can do it does

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.299 
but that's as many as you can do it does
have<00:06:19.999> a<00:06:20.059> limit<00:06:20.509> I<00:06:21.319> have<00:06:21.770> found<00:06:22.009> it<00:06:22.159> to<00:06:22.189> be

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:22.309 
have a limit I have found it to be

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.689 
have a limit I have found it to be
rather<00:06:22.939> worth<00:06:23.539> it<00:06:23.830> if<00:06:24.830> you're<00:06:25.039> just<00:06:25.249> messing

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
rather worth it if you're just messing

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.249 
rather worth it if you're just messing
around<00:06:25.819> and<00:06:26.120> you<00:06:26.210> have<00:06:26.330> spare<00:06:26.629> time<00:06:26.659> the<00:06:27.110> other

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
around and you have spare time the other

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.679 
around and you have spare time the other
thing<00:06:27.469> is<00:06:27.649> is<00:06:27.830> being<00:06:28.550> that<00:06:28.759> you<00:06:29.270> only<00:06:29.389> need<00:06:29.659> to

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
thing is is being that you only need to

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.110 
thing is is being that you only need to
sorcery<00:06:30.439> abilities<00:06:30.979> really<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.969> could

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
sorcery abilities really you could

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.329 
sorcery abilities really you could
change<00:06:32.689> these<00:06:33.020> other<00:06:33.289> two<00:06:33.620> to<00:06:33.889> whatever<00:06:34.219> you

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:34.339 
change these other two to whatever you

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.420 
change these other two to whatever you
want<00:06:34.580> and<00:06:34.789> level<00:06:35.120> those<00:06:35.270> at<00:06:35.479> the<00:06:35.539> same<00:06:35.810> time

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
want and level those at the same time

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.129 
want and level those at the same time
because<00:06:37.430> you're<00:06:37.759> leveling<00:06:38.180> with<00:06:38.479> both<00:06:38.749> of<00:06:38.779> the

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
because you're leveling with both of the

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.070 
because you're leveling with both of the
coin<00:06:39.709> purse<00:06:40.009> labour<00:06:40.520> points<00:06:41.029> and<00:06:41.209> then<00:06:41.479> the

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
coin purse labour points and then the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.209 
coin purse labour points and then the
fact<00:06:42.289> that<00:06:42.379> you're<00:06:42.589> killing<00:06:42.830> stuff<00:06:43.069> the

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
fact that you're killing stuff the

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.409 
fact that you're killing stuff the
entire<00:06:43.490> time<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:43.729> think<00:06:43.969> it's<00:06:44.089> only<00:06:44.209> worth<00:06:44.389> like

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
entire time I think it's only worth like

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.350 
entire time I think it's only worth like
200<00:06:45.020> experience<00:06:45.469> but<00:06:45.680> it's<00:06:45.709> something<00:06:46.209> if<00:06:47.209> you

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360
