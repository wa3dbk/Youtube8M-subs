00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 new appointment with mirko sneijder of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.519
 what we talk today lucrative no you use 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.839
 my sclero momentary but they are years 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 I'm looking for this little gem 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.330
 fully functional with party 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.260
 so original and now I found it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.760
 then I was practically in an afternoon 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 sclero I was doing there was one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 discount on amazon of 5 euros that I spent 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.000
 over 50 euros 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 I was looking for some shit 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 practically to fill the cart 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 up to get to 50 euros and I think it is 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.309
 too long I don't look good for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.160
 see if there is an iphone 2g available 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.600
 now working immediately and the network I have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 done open ebay 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 I left the Amazon pages open and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 in the meantime I peeked and jumped 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.180
 to the eye immediately this iphone 2g in the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 fully functional description 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 with some scratches on the back and on the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 power button screen slightly 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.380
 defective at the special price of 90 euros 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 they guys got it right 90 euros 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 plus 7 of shipments we make 100 euros 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.580
 this gem is the only thing for 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.530
 me counts more than any other product 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 existing in the apple world 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 this product is the thing he did 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 break through apple in the world like everyone 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.939
 we know 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 Steve Jobs had been kicked out of the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.770
 apple because he was failing assholes 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.100
 java right and left is practically 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.250
 he returns in 2001 presented the first 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 ipod and in 2007 revolutionized the world 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.009
 of technology and smartphones of the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.119
 world presenting precisely the iphone 2g 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.030
 from that moment all the houses 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.680
 smartphone and tablet manufacturers 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.290
 later with the arrival of ipad yes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.479
 they are inspired by this in quotation marks 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.939
 product for example all phones from 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 then they became touchscreens 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.750
 so we all need now 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.560
 a touchscreen phone and thanks 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.720
 to this product that had come out years ago 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.239
 only in america therefore currently 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.280
 you can't even use it 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.959
 this model that I purchased in 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.879
 italy because it is only for the sim 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.160
 American therefore blocked yes yes yes yes 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.420
 I could do the jailbreak I could do 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.700
 asshole 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.970
 meanwhile I don't want hygiene 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.440
 keep it original so indeed if I could 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 to downgrade to 1.0 nava 3.1.3 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.530
 I would like to see how true the first one was 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
 iphone 2g and nothing i am 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.060
 particularly gassed because in my opinion 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.910
 the difference between these two or between 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.849
 the 5 s and the 2g pact obviously of 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.330
 performance and anything but this one 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.000
 inside put this in this melina this 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.330
 Velina is the soul of Steve Jobs because 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 one of his doc products is what he has 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.750
 changed the world 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.819
 this instead a product fruit of the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.830
 work of many other people included 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.470
 Steve Jobs but of course as we know it is 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.989
 died in 2011 so I would say that the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 work done on this by Steve Jobs not 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.040
 it is comparable to that done on this 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.459
 it's a part of me in here 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.849
 steve jobs but now we move on to things 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.890
 beautiful of this of this video because 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.830
 I did n't unbox this morning 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.440
 that video was too family I do not 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.150
 please, I was too anxious for 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.819
 this package I slept very little 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 because I knew this was coming 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.190
 this package is the only thing I do 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.170
 I noticed and didn't have a cabbage 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.709
 I had an old 30-pin dock cable 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.140
 all dear lightning all not only 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.700
 obviously had to borrow then I have 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.370
 found in the drawers found that of 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 very old iphone 3gs that is now 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.290
 serving to recharge and operate 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.030
 and sync my iphone 2g 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.689
 I personally think it's a 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.180
 wonderful product as a parity of design 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.620
 I very much prefer the iPhone 2g a 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.200
 all the iphone's that came out later 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.360
 including my iphone 5s 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.130
 because the iphone 2g and has the charm of the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.889
 first product has the charm of a 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.780
 product that really was 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.180
 revolutionary or what they are from 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.039
 all come out 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.710
 totti that we know today on the market 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.419
 smartphones and even tablets e 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.320
 then you dare to tell me that it is 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.360
 this design is not striking anyway 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.740
 guys this is a short video for 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.930
 show you this in 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.570
 description I leave the video of the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.699
 review of this iphone 2g though 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.979
 in a delay of 7 years of course but there 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.780
 we held the anniversary together 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.550
 which happened a few days ago 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.990
 of the iPhone 2g to review 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 depth of the device 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.190
 a video comparison with the last one released 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.750
 apple house or the iPhone 5 s 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.910
