00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
actually going to slide into this thing

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.760 
actually going to slide into this thing
feet<00:02:17.160> first<00:02:17.490> instead<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.300> head<00:02:18.570> first<00:02:18.840> because

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
feet first instead of head first because

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.820 
feet first instead of head first because
I<00:02:19.950> am<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.670> cocooned<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.480> my<00:02:22.350> sleep

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I am going to be cocooned in my sleep

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.460 
I am going to be cocooned in my sleep
system<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:24.030> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> take<00:02:24.930> away<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
system and that's going to take away the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.070 
system and that's going to take away the
ability<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:26.250> me<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> move<00:02:26.700> my<00:02:26.910> arms<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.050> I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
and this is going to be my home for the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
and this is going to be my home for the
night<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.820> will<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.240> how<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:59.120> all

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
night and we will see how it does all

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.870 
night and we will see how it does all
right<00:03:00.330> guys<00:03:00.600> well<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:02.070> time<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.520> hit<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.820> hay

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.229 

currently<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.030> about<00:03:07.400> no<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.120> it's

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
currently it's about no I think it's

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.930 
currently it's about no I think it's
about<00:03:09.390> ten<00:03:09.690> degrees<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:13.489> not<00:03:14.489> terribly

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
about ten degrees or so but not terribly

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.670 
about ten degrees or so but not terribly
cold<00:03:16.100> no<00:03:17.100> wind<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.700> now<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.180> still

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
cold no wind right now it's all still

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.229 
cold no wind right now it's all still
but<00:03:20.690> supposed<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.780> get<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.350> about<00:03:22.590> zero

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
but supposed to get down to about zero

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.940 
but supposed to get down to about zero
degrees<00:03:24.239> Fahrenheit<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.320> think<00:03:28.590> that's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
degrees Fahrenheit so I think that's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.290 
degrees Fahrenheit so I think that's
somewhere<00:03:29.310> around<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.700> ballpark<00:03:30.180> of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
somewhere around the ballpark of

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.670 
somewhere around the ballpark of
negative

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.390 

sixteen<00:03:36.680> negative<00:03:37.580> 18<00:03:38.150> degrees<00:03:38.510> Celsius<00:03:39.400> then

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
sixteen negative 18 degrees Celsius then

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.940 
sixteen negative 18 degrees Celsius then
anyway<00:03:40.750> all<00:03:41.750> right<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.170> lied<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.709> you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
anyway all right so I lied to you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.290 
anyway all right so I lied to you
whenever<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.280> crawled<00:03:43.610> in<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:43.819> I<00:03:44.060> was

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
whenever I crawled in here I was

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.839 
whenever I crawled in here I was
thinking<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.629> was<00:03:44.720> about<00:03:44.930> 10<00:03:45.230> degrees<00:03:45.819> well<00:03:46.819> I

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
thinking I was about 10 degrees well I

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.650 
thinking I was about 10 degrees well I
just<00:03:47.030> woke<00:03:47.420> up<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.959> had<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.410> use<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.680> restroom

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
just woke up I had to use the restroom

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.270 
just woke up I had to use the restroom
it's<00:03:50.660> about<00:03:50.840> midnight<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.099> actually

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
it's about midnight and you can actually

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's about midnight and you can actually
see<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.819> it's<00:03:53.030> 16<00:03:53.900> degrees<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:56.180> know<00:03:56.360> it

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
see that it's 16 degrees you know it

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.059 
see that it's 16 degrees you know it
looks<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.019> low<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.470> supposed<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:57.890> get

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
looks like the low is supposed to get

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.720 
looks like the low is supposed to get
down<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.489> about<00:03:58.700> 4<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:01.220> anyway

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
down to about 4 so anyway

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.550 
down to about 4 so anyway
not<00:04:02.330> quite<00:04:02.569> as<00:04:02.690> cold<00:04:02.870> as<00:04:03.080> what<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.230> thought<00:04:03.290> it

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
not quite as cold as what I thought it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.630 
not quite as cold as what I thought it
was<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.180> either<00:04:05.180> way<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.860> far<00:04:07.129> so<00:04:07.370> good<00:04:09.640> it's

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
was but either way so far so good it's

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.160 
was but either way so far so good it's
actually<00:04:10.790> quite<00:04:11.450> cozy<00:04:12.819> all<00:04:13.819> right<00:04:14.060> I'm<00:04:14.959> here

going back to sleep just because the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.240 
going back to sleep just because the
simple<00:04:20.540> fact<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.959> I'm<00:04:21.739> starting<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
simple fact that I'm starting to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.550 
simple fact that I'm starting to
overheat<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:25.100> I'm<00:04:25.970> gonna<00:04:26.090> pull<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.690> where

I'm actually gonna try to work my way
out<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.919> snow<00:04:31.400> shelter<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.360> little

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.460 
out of this snow shelter just a little
bit<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:34.479> see<00:04:35.479> if<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.840> cool<00:04:36.020> off<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.320> little

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
bit and see if I can cool off a little

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.260 
bit and see if I can cool off a little
bit<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.100> crawl<00:04:37.400> back<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:40.270> definitely

bit and crawl back in so definitely
staying<00:04:41.510> warm<00:04:41.889> ok<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:42.950> here<00:04:43.280> we<00:04:43.310> are

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
staying warm ok so here we are

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.450 
staying warm ok so here we are
the<00:04:43.910> following<00:04:44.240> morning<00:04:44.539> of<00:04:45.200> testing<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.250> GI

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
the following morning of testing the GI

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.870 
the following morning of testing the GI
modular<00:04:47.150> Sleep<00:04:47.419> System<00:04:48.010> it's<00:04:49.010> about<00:04:49.310> 3

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
modular Sleep System it's about 3

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.409 
modular Sleep System it's about 3
degrees<00:04:50.000> right<00:04:50.600> now<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:51.530> very<00:04:51.680> cold<00:04:52.070> outside

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
degrees right now it's very cold outside

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.469

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.180 
but in that Sleep System it was very
very<00:04:57.320> warm<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:58.070> did<00:04:58.729> not<00:04:58.880> get<00:04:59.090> chilled<00:04:59.389> at<00:04:59.660> all

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.980 

at<00:05:03.190> one<00:05:03.370> point<00:05:03.610> like<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:03.880> said<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.180> had<00:05:04.480> to<00:05:04.600> crawl

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
at one point like I said I had to crawl

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.050 
at one point like I said I had to crawl
out<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.560> air<00:05:05.770> out<00:05:05.980> a<00:05:06.010> little<00:05:06.310> bit<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:06.850> didn't

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
out and air out a little bit so I didn't

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.920 
out and air out a little bit so I didn't
overheat<00:05:07.630> which<00:05:07.960> was<00:05:09.360> sucked<00:05:10.360> but<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.840> know

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
overheat which was sucked but you know

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.680 
overheat which was sucked but you know
what<00:05:11.140> I'd<00:05:11.320> rather<00:05:11.980> be<00:05:12.190> too<00:05:12.460> hot<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.360> then<00:05:13.510> too

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
what I'd rather be too hot and then too

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.220 
what I'd rather be too hot and then too
cold<00:05:15.000> one<00:05:16.000> thing<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.420> I<00:05:16.480> had<00:05:16.660> found<00:05:16.900> through

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
cold one thing that I had found through

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.960 
cold one thing that I had found through
trial<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.650> error<00:05:17.740> with<00:05:18.280> this<00:05:18.460> thing<00:05:18.700> and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
trial and error with this thing and

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.940 
trial and error with this thing and
temperatures<00:05:19.480> like<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:19.870> people<00:05:20.620> are<00:05:20.740> more

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
temperatures like this people are more

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.940 
temperatures like this people are more
inclined<00:05:21.340> to<00:05:21.520> wear<00:05:21.820> more<00:05:22.120> clothing<00:05:22.480> and

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
inclined to wear more clothing and

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
inclined to wear more clothing and
actually<00:05:23.950> you<00:05:24.070> know<00:05:24.100> what<00:05:24.430> when<00:05:24.670> you<00:05:24.790> wear

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
actually you know what when you wear

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.690 
actually you know what when you wear
less<00:05:25.270> clothing<00:05:25.660> inside<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.920> modular<00:05:27.460> sleep

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
less clothing inside that modular sleep

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.830 
less clothing inside that modular sleep
system<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:29.200> just<00:05:29.320> go<00:05:29.500> with<00:05:29.650> Polly<00:05:29.860> prose<00:05:30.840> it's

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
system and just go with Polly prose it's

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.080 
system and just go with Polly prose it's
it's<00:05:32.110> better<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.980> don't<00:05:33.370> feel<00:05:33.460> restricted

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
it's better it you don't feel restricted

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.650 
it's better it you don't feel restricted
and<00:05:35.280> you<00:05:36.280> know<00:05:36.400> ultimately<00:05:36.580> it's<00:05:37.210> just<00:05:37.300> it

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
and you know ultimately it's just it

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
and you know ultimately it's just it
just<00:05:37.690> feels<00:05:37.900> a<00:05:38.170> lot<00:05:38.290> better

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
just feels a lot better

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.780 
just feels a lot better
oh<00:05:38.880> my

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.190 

like<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.150> said<00:05:46.450> in<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.660> beginning<00:05:46.780> of<00:05:47.110> the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
like I said in the beginning of the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.530 
like I said in the beginning of the
video<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:47.680> do<00:05:48.250> need<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.640> ground<00:05:48.940> pad<00:05:49.270> though

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
video you do need a ground pad though

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.630 
video you do need a ground pad though
okay<00:05:50.050> don't<00:05:50.320> kid<00:05:50.530> yourself<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:51.010> will<00:05:51.400> need<00:05:51.610> a

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
okay don't kid yourself you will need a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.020 
okay don't kid yourself you will need a
ground<00:05:51.850> pad<00:05:52.740> conduction<00:05:53.740> is<00:05:53.980> a<00:05:54.040> bastard<00:05:54.760> and

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
ground pad conduction is a bastard and

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.000 
ground pad conduction is a bastard and
it<00:05:55.690> will<00:05:55.870> suck<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.200> heat<00:05:56.500> right<00:05:56.530> out<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:56.890> you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
it will suck the heat right out of you

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.980 
it will suck the heat right out of you
even<00:05:57.370> though<00:05:57.580> you're<00:05:57.790> in<00:05:58.030> one<00:05:58.480> of<00:05:58.570> these<00:05:58.660> sleep

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
even though you're in one of these sleep

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.310 
even though you're in one of these sleep
systems<00:05:59.670> so<00:06:00.670> I<00:06:00.970> hope<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.660> guys<00:06:01.810> have<00:06:01.990> enjoyed

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
systems so I hope you guys have enjoyed

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
systems so I hope you guys have enjoyed
this<00:06:02.680> video<00:06:03.040> on<00:06:03.490> the<00:06:04.210> GI<00:06:04.420> sleep<00:06:04.900> system<00:06:05.380> and<00:06:06.130> I

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
this video on the GI sleep system and I

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.560 
this video on the GI sleep system and I
hope<00:06:06.550> this<00:06:06.730> has<00:06:06.910> answered<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:07.360> few<00:06:07.510> questions

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570

and how well it might work in conditions

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:24.700 
and how well it might work in conditions
such<00:06:12.940> as<00:06:13.120> this<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:14.050> as<00:06:14.800> always<00:06:15.040> guys
