I<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:09.030> hooked<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> computer<00:02:10.129> it's

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
I have hooked up to the computer it's

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.500 
I have hooked up to the computer it's
also<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.640> cool<00:02:11.819> too<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> can

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
also pretty cool too because you can

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.830 
also pretty cool too because you can
actually<00:02:12.629> hit<00:02:12.840> talk

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
actually hit talk

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.270

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
really sure what the point of that would

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.750 
really sure what the point of that would
be<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.209> if<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.680> had<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.099> know<00:02:21.129> laptop

it allows you to connect from remotely

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.400 
it allows you to connect from remotely
