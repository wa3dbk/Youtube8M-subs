00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.920
 are you thinking what he said have been the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
 connection when they loved the guys and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.640
 all of that you remember 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.970
 yes yes, luckily, it happened not 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.770
 that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.150
 what he means is that we 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.260
 We can leave our problems aside 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.890
 if it wants superficial 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.890
 why 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:14.080
 first that now 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.080
 if I return it but a moment like that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.880
 and why would you be 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:26.900
 she is nervous besides having the others 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 I 'm not thinking about the promise that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.970
 we did 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.760
 and this seems like the promise we made 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.110
 what do you think this is that the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.310
 promise itself you think it 's fine what 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.670
 what are you doing that I'm doing 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
 we are dancing what are you talking about 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.689
 this is a lion disaster and carme with your 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.070
 same you know I bought nothing 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.770
 confuse you but you do not 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 unfortunately the six sets that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.600
 that you can is a tailor is a later 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.190
 because it confuses people because I 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.310
 it brings that for that thesis the beau and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.960
 confuse people the one in which they 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.009
 they confused was about for a dollar 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.009
 you put the heart this 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.700
 I can personal divisions is good 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.580
 they do not argue anymore it does not make sense what 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.050
 they are doing girls 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 There is something you have to know 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.400
 I do not understand you're not talking 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.400
 you have to say 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.310
 is that he listened to them discuss the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.520
 I do, yes, and it does not make sense 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.980
 meaning because the two are good and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 they can put together an accordion before traveling 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.540
 and me and the guys and especially 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.819
 broadway and broadway can help them 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.540
 if they want good if it's so simple because 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.540
 He is nervous 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 in the eyes is the one who has a bad day 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.540
 today it is tremendous to tell you and make a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.230
 question that I'm just asking 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 because this does not make sense 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.920
 I am the one who can not speak is so 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 he betrayed you why 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.560
 that looks bad 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.750
 I'm not well and you know that this 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.750
 guilt of the boy who has just gone
