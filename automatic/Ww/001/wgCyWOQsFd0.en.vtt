00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.640
 good Sunday to all the boys are 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.199
 millions and welcome back with the fifteenth 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.500
 episode of the top five place of the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.119
 week 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.710
 today we are here with really clips 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.849
 fantastic that I really did a lot 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.619
 struggling to choose 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.970
 we start in fifth place with dame peak 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.489
 who is playing starts with a wolgang 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.050
 really nice then you have to count that in 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.579
 this clip has just started the game 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.199
 so the difficulty is even more 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.110
 difficult because you are not organized 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.659
 we have not yet said the vision of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.659
 game is however what makes us from mpix makes us a 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.629
 vis very fast in about ten seconds 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.309
 really nice clip for mpix per quarter 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 place we find the live that is playing 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.469
 on team deathmatch with a bartender 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.750
 scarella makes a quick scott and so far it is 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.219
 a clip that can be normal then 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.570
 on deathmatch and I'm not easy 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.869
 to find all together look what 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.869
 quizz coop you turn quiz coop you back 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.759
 a triple instant one shot really this 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.940
 clip was fantastic because you watch 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.890
 let's watch it again it makes a quick scop 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.690
 triple one shot beautiful kate for 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 the hiv compliments you will find her 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.780
 channel in description 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.789
 in third place we find ours 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.950
 dear jtf reebok and continue a 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.170
 appear in these clips in these tops 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.360
 sorry you've already killed two 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.030
 launch us 4 sestu plan but it's not over 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.770
 because gtf ribot is a dog not you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.239
 never satisfies and a dog really everybody 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.099
 the effects because even 9 is dirty 

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.800
 joking poor ribbon and continuing the 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:40.090
 its huge feed kills one 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.130
 behind the other he is really tireless 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.319
 equitable sharpened really the most nuclear 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.259
 fast in italy because you look in one 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.090
 twenty seconds it was already at 15 watched 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.830
 already soulless 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.319
 it really is in me well in the shift 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.310
 to make a sectional job and die from 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.259
 behind in a really way 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.119
 horrible to be a jerk anyway 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.220
 compliments ribot great nice clip 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.670
 in second place we find things 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.069
 absurd we find the reds who aims one 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.709
 killing rimi its me v2 triple one 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.119
 shot of intervention then I liked it 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.910
 a lot because the first clip I got 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.980
 send on mv 2 and look don't believe it 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.620
 neither was he because he left and which 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 he saw only one and he says ok I kill him 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 then he goes down to take his hands off it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.430
 Raise sees them still only one shoots 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.610
 triple and jazz really great clip 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 there are really beautiful for race 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.909
 really shitty when 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.310
 but I saw it when you see the first one 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.950
 you'll understand why this one didn't win 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.769
 in fact we come to the first place where 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 we find a member of the vidia club that i am 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.670
 he sent lots of clips but not 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.660
 I could put them all in the vidia dino leaves 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.519
 on the nuketown on pc world one shot this 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.709
 it was something fantastic because 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.989
 look out the bus is not even 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.560
 the spot we say behind the armchair yes 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.540
 turns aim there is no one then buys in 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.150
 all in one shot quad one shot really 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.860
 at random, however, really these guys 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.989
 This time clips were for me 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.690
 perhaps the best of each episode 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.980
 because they really broke a lot 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.620
 anyway as you can see here 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.970
 dual shot water anyway guys with 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.859
 the video is coming to an end vi 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.810
 I would like to say the last two things 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.609
 first you don't get angry except 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.019
 all clips have been uploaded as 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.269
 I said he already has the last time 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.170
 lots of things really come and choose them 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.209
 it is never easy 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.760
 then if your clip already gone maybe 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.859
 in another top five what do I know they gtf 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.230
 I will try not to put it back because maybe 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.419
 from space a little all and then not 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 risks becoming repetitive anyway 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.940
 guys really hope this video 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.739

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.569
