like<00:02:17.520> Microsoft's<00:02:18.150> mindset<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.260> don't

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
like Microsoft's mindset on that I don't

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.340 
like Microsoft's mindset on that I don't
know<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> think<00:02:20.730> Sony<00:02:21.360> does<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> right<00:02:22.110> out<00:02:22.320> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350
