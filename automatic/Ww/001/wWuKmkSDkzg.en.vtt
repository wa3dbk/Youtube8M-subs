00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
know it's been forever since I posted a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
know it's been forever since I posted a
video<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.360> over<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> year<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.710> life<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.219> got

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
video like over a year but life just got

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.640 
video like over a year but life just got
in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.059> decided<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.870> new<00:00:16.170> year<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
in the way but I decided this new year I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.740 
in the way but I decided this new year I
really<00:00:17.039> wanted<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.609> come<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> YouTube

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
really wanted to come back to YouTube

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560 
really wanted to come back to YouTube
and<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> thought<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:21.090> would<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.270> different

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and so I thought what would be different

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.170 
and so I thought what would be different
that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.680> haven't<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.430> seen<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.789> YouTube

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that I haven't really seen on YouTube

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.660 
that I haven't really seen on YouTube
that<00:00:24.720> would<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.260> fun<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.250> want<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that would be fun and really want you to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
that would be fun and really want you to
come<00:00:26.880> back<00:00:27.029> every<00:00:27.330> week<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> new<00:00:28.410> video

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
come back every week and see a new video

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.150 
come back every week and see a new video
so<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.760> came<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> idea<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.160> posting

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
like if I was shampooing my hair in the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.870 
like if I was shampooing my hair in the
shower<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.860> kind<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.250> gives<00:02:13.520> it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
shower and this just kind of gives it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.290 
shower and this just kind of gives it
that<00:02:14.080> massive<00:02:15.080> volume<00:02:15.710> without<00:02:16.340> teasing<00:02:17.150> it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
that massive volume without teasing it

that massive volume without teasing it
which<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.930> great<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.260> you're<00:02:18.500> skipping<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
which is great because you're skipping a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.090 
which is great because you're skipping a
step<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.110> teasing<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:21.230> hair<00:02:21.260> unless<00:02:21.920> you're

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
step and teasing your hair unless you're

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.070

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
doing it properly just really ruins it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.840 
doing it properly just really ruins it
and<00:02:24.200> breaks<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.620> hair<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> prefer<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.700> do
