that was one of the reasons why heist

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
that was one of the reasons why heist
never<00:00:45.000> came<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:45.899> were<00:00:45.989> supposed

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
which rockstar claimed that it was the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 
which rockstar claimed that it was the
reason<00:00:50.730> why<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> swear<00:00:51.510> being<00:00:51.690> delayed<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.170> at

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
reason why I swear being delayed or at

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.250 
reason why I swear being delayed or at
least<00:00:52.440> people<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.870> insinuated<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

least people also insinuated that this
was<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> reason<00:00:55.739> why<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.460> also<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> lot

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
was the reason why and it was also a lot

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
was the reason why and it was also a lot
of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> exploits<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> glitches

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and stuff which in reality didn't really

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
and stuff which in reality didn't really
matter<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> much<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.600> if<00:01:03.600> Rockstar

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
matter all that much because if Rockstar

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
rid of all of these money glitches all
of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> exploits<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.619> could<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of the exploits they really could do it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250 
of the exploits they really could do it
in<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.970> fell<00:01:12.150> swoop<00:01:12.210> they<00:01:12.780> could<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.140> just

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
in one fell swoop they could really just

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
in one fell swoop they could really just
do<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.770> eliminate<00:01:14.189> everything<00:01:14.460> but

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
do it and eliminate everything but

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
do it and eliminate everything but
they're<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.360> they're<00:01:16.020> stalling<00:01:16.290> I've

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
they're not and they're stalling I've
always<00:01:16.890> thought<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> aspect<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
always thought that from the aspect of a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
always thought that from the aspect of a
business<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.430> heist<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.210> be

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
business that heist would not be

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.230 
business that heist would not be
released<00:01:21.659> anytime<00:01:21.990> soon<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:24.150> know

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
released anytime soon because you know

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
released anytime soon because you know
heist<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> biggest<00:01:25.140> hyped<00:01:25.409> event<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
heist is the biggest hyped event that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.819 
heist is the biggest hyped event that
rockstar<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.330> their<00:01:27.479> sleeve<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.470> once

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
rockstar has up their sleeve so once

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
rockstar has up their sleeve so once
heist<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.460> done<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.659> offer

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
heist is done what more can they offer

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
heist is done what more can they offer
us<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> meantime<00:01:32.040> while

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
us so I think in the meantime while

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
us so I think in the meantime while
heist<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.659> being<00:01:33.990> held<00:01:34.320> hostage<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.040> think

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
heist are being held hostage I think

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
heist are being held hostage I think
there's<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.659> things<00:01:37.229> being<00:01:37.619> developed

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there's more things being developed

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
there's more things being developed
behind<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> scenes<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.210> no<00:01:39.450> clue

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
behind the scenes that we have no clue

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.950 
behind the scenes that we have no clue
whatsoever<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.780> think

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
whatsoever as to what it is and I think

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
whatsoever as to what it is and I think
it's<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.799> business<00:01:44.189> strategy

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's just it's just a business strategy

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.899 
it's just it's just a business strategy

anything<00:01:57.119> close<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.200> think<00:01:58.590> it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
anything close to what we think it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280 
anything close to what we think it's
gonna<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.570> don't<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:00.960> it's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
gonna be and I really don't think it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.859 
gonna be and I really don't think it's
gonna<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.680> long<00:02:02.610> term<00:02:02.969> thing<00:02:03.030> I've<00:02:03.630> always

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
gonna be a long term thing I've always

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.170 
gonna be a long term thing I've always
said<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:05.790> make<00:02:06.000> money

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.609 
said that it was because they make money
off<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.600> shark<00:02:06.869> cards<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
way for them to kind of hold off from

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.110 
way for them to kind of hold off from
the<00:02:10.840> big<00:02:11.019> fish<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> dlcs<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.760> sort<00:02:13.030> of

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
as people I guess I guess we can sort of

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.130 
as people I guess I guess we can sort of
boycott<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.819> game<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.209> not<00:02:40.329> play<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.900> all

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
boycott the game and not play that all

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.530 
boycott the game and not play that all
but<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.530> reality<00:02:41.709> who's<00:02:42.250> gonna<00:02:42.489> do<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
but in reality who's gonna do that you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.300 
but in reality who's gonna do that you
know<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.870> would<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.200> only<00:02:44.230> logical<00:02:44.739> step

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
know that would be the only logical step

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.509 
know that would be the only logical step
next<00:02:45.879> in<00:02:46.090> regards<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.930> them<00:02:47.560> not<00:02:47.799> releasing

come out the week the tuesday before the
20th<00:03:08.260> which<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.069> believe<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.700> like<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> psycho

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
20th which I believe it's like a psycho

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.119 
20th which I believe it's like a psycho
17th<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.290> think<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:11.829> something<00:03:12.069> like

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129

17th I think it is or something like
that<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.459> 18th<00:03:12.819> I'm<00:03:13.000> not<00:03:13.359> sure<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.540> think<00:03:13.720> it's

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that the 18th I'm not sure I think it's

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.229 
that the 18th I'm not sure I think it's
a<00:03:13.900> 17<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.519> think<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:15.849> going<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.000> be<00:03:16.060> on

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
a 17 but I think it's going to be on

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.300 
a 17 but I think it's going to be on
that<00:03:16.269> particular<00:03:16.750> Tuesday<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.950> does<00:03:18.099> end
