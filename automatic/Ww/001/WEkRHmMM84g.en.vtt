00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello youtube friends as they are today 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.420
 I'm going to present an application for 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.420
 very good camera was healthy soon here 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.900
 He likes camera applications 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.390
 your android phones because I 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 sincerely in the store the presto I 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.529
 I do not find many applications for me 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.350
 I like photography a lot 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.769
 but honestly I prefer more a 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.260
 native camera of samsung galaxy s not in 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.329
 my case because they have the functions 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.850
 basic curse does not have the battery 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.059
 they have basic functions 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.600
 that is, it can fix has cars a 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.460
 Camera pen works perfectly 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 but of the others we call you the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.440
 others for myself more work for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.180
 send upload your photos to instagram or not 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 I know what about that instagram application 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.600
 to upload them to facebook you have access 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.269
 fast but I prefer the more 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.949
 native camera but I found a one 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.800
 application that yes the truth yes I liked 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.670
 I do not know more about a camera 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.620
 because I highlight more this than the other 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 because besides that it's too much 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.680
 simple and has nice effects 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 It has very nice effects 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.930
 simple effects 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.780
 can record video but not only 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.160
 record video but I can record video 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.240
 in the form of a frame 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.180
 this macro form 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 the circulars these and I can be 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.150
 tutorials can be done very well 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.400
 tutorials with this camera 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.130
 this application sorry this application 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.380
 Of camera 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 and you can do tutorials with your 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.260
 phone already because you have the option 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.020
 to focus your your lens not on the camera 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.030
 but the native camera of the chs can not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
 and according to other other applications of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 camera can not be these 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.820
 just this application and that's why I 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.350
 I really like to record a lot 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.320
 the camera that other things have is 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.650
 this application plus a camera then 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.500
 obviously that same name they say 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.810
 can be a lot are too are although 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.850
 It does not favor the quality of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.510
 image but then of day to be a 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.510
 little better not 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.120
 let's focus a bit better 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.120
 then it does better they are 1 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 but that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.910
 avoids quality is not reduced in quality 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.060
 but for photographers it is very good 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.860
 It is because you can not tell much to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.800
 samsung galaxy days that only has 5 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.340
 megapixels do not I do not rely much on the 5 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.260
 meters 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.870
 we rely on camera quality myself 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.030
 I rely more on what is the autofocus 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.090
 because I like it a lot, I like it 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.920
 take many things up close or whatever 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.300
 and I just wanted to share this 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040
 application because it has become very good 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 is in this camera application the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.530
 first is that I do this and then that 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.470
 will serve I hope you liked it if 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.650
 they liked subscribe week up and 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.020
 it would be everything I feel a little 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.630
 stupid recording and recording from my 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.630
 phone nobody
