00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.389 

2084<00:00:32.640> blocks<00:00:33.149> high<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.219> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
2084 blocks high which if you do that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.510 
2084 blocks high which if you do that
the<00:00:35.610> map<00:00:35.880> will<00:00:36.230> take<00:00:37.230> ages<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> render<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the map will take ages to render and the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
the map will take ages to render and the
lag<00:00:38.760> spikes<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.329> horrible<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.500> it's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
lag spikes will be horrible but it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.319

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there's a lot of lag but let's hope it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:03.510 
there's a lot of lag but let's hope it
will<00:00:51.360> work<00:00:55.370> yeah<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:57.510> does
