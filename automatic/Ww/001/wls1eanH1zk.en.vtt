00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
 look look 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.730
 to me 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.750
 with my songs 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.390
 let's go for music I will love it 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.369
 We spent a few days in Coroico one of the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.500
 most tourist destinations near the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.620
 peace about 100 kilometers from the capital 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.090
 from Bolivia in the area of â€‹â€‹the yungas 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.430
 among the most outstanding attractions 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.059
 there are three waterfalls in the kitchen 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.530
 san fÃ©lix and santo cinto these jumps of 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.290
 water are near the population 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.570
 and they form pools of ice water and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.710
 crystalline that cool anyone 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 that is encouraged to immerse 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.060
 near the waterfalls on the slopes of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.710
 Cerro Chomachi are also found 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.290
 where many areas are not pre if we 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 they cultivate the precious coca leaf 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.330
 to cope with altitude sickness 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.450
 clean clothes to see if it dries with the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.039
 wind 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.039
 we can follow the entire route 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.040
 we go to yolosa which is the town 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.950
 end where the mythical path end 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.590
 the road of death 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.659
 from ecological we have arrived at yolosa 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.820
 which is the final town where the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.399
 road of death in truth the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.619
 road now is not as busy 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.390
 let's say there is a road in the other 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.549
 side of the mountain that is paved and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 this where they go to traffic and then 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.450
 now this road has stayed more 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 for tourism that's why we see so many 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.500
 bicycles around here but also 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 there is an activity that lives and called a lot 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.920
 the attention that is called slip line and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 stretch with a zip line and also 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.909
 It has as three stretches it has to be 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.769
 awesome we met some guys that 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.230
 they went and they loved it so I could not 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.220
 resist me and we go running to 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.710
 try this activity 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.900
 at the yolosa store of the ship company 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.670
 of flying fox we prepare ourselves with the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 harness needed to perform the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.380
 activity then in 4x4 brings us up to 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 the first of the three lines that cross 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.630
 the final part of the road of the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 death 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.920
 superman 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.110
 we have three wires the sum of the three 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.580
 cables thousand 555 meters the first cable is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.930
 the highest the second is the fastest 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.930
 and the third one be longer 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.220
 good cool is really 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.349
 It seems like flying especially when 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.569
 Superman strips you callers are you 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.760
 as flying and it seems to go slow 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.739
 but you go to 80 per hour when you do 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.030
 superman there is delighted because it seems 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.580
 really that you go like in a 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.489
 helicopter as you do not see anything and the day you 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:40.099
 you do not see any cable or anything water 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:41.540
 fantastic and we are on the road of 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.299
 death the mythical road of the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.790
 death one of the roads as they say 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.200
 most dangerous in the world not really 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.900
 here there has been a large number of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.910
 accidents and fatal accidents 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.380
 especially before they enjoyed 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.360
 the road and did a second 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.730
 paved road and that's where now 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.140
 most vehicles are the only thing that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.330
 you have to really be careful now 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.019
 it's with the bikes that there's good 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.099
 a tour mounted from peace to 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.099
 practically coroico people 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.489
 but really this is a highway 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.980
 spectacular just have to see the 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.239
 precipices that are around here and good what 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.480
 what is there wants a little bit with care of 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.030
 not to get really close really not because 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.570
 It crumbles and falls apart if you here 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.570
 you do not explain it 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.449
 during the 80 km that the highway has 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.639
 you also find numerous 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.099
 crosses that remember the deaths in 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.169
 accident that there has been an average of 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:55.789
 209 accidents and about 96 deaths per year 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.199
 this data was one of the reasons why 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.590
 that the inter-American 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:04.270
 development declared it in 1995 as the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.270
 most dangerous road in the world 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 ah 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.789
 and the best of being traveling in a 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.949
 camper van and to be in this 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.649
 Road of death little traveled 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.569
 is that we can to cook our 

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:36.989
 rociito and we put here a rice with 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.989
 these views of rice and risotto 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.319
 I hope it does not rain because they start 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.180
 to listen to sleep but it's like being in 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.710
 clouds 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.419
 we are at the same height as the clouds 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.740
 3000 meters 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.740
 yes no 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.970
 in this area it is also common 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.860
 rain and fog that decreases the 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.199
 visibility makes them come off 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.199
 stones leaves the road full of mud 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.560
 it seems that we have entered the cloud 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.210
 I do not know anything 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.490
 and this road is already dangerous 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.490
 normal conditions imagine you answer 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.630
 in fact for sensitive hearts 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.650
 as we left here from yolosa but here 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.260
 we have done the whole road of the 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.650
 death going through the different 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.650
 viewpoints 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.560
 and good finally as the slogan says 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.770
 we survived the road of death 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.770
 when there was 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.140
 the truth 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.590
 plus 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.590
 and
