00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Welcome to the fight of the week 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.970
 in this case year with a true one 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.410
 a bow shot a no goblin 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.929
 a giant a balloon a balloon 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.330
 once purity unites a joke 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.690
 because I do not bock all this woman too 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.219
 read 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 So you can see them, respectively 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.970
 you can not see them either 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.789
 unit did not use and in the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.619
 principle one could also hide the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.779
 week but we will come soon 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.539
 yes, i just have this comment 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.830
 selected here from the dear boris 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.690
 break is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 we just catch me directly are 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.320
 that just looks like this too 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.820
 whole units company sees now 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.110
 We also lack 94 units 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 only the golem 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.559
 otherwise I have everything at the start what have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 Unfortunately, I do not yet and since I recognize 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.579
 money spent, I thought to myself 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 I just go away then and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 besides james bell unfortunately the freestyle 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.129
 have also not but otherwise 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 actually everything at the start 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 yes, in principle, you could talk about this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 he is actually fighting 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 completely for the ass I would have 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.770
 just a much weaker one 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 opponents from our course in the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 archers queen we have too 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 not that we are missing three units 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.689
 Golem then the Golem and what a lot 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.040
 twice fine no you already have it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.080
 understood so long considered how do 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 Of course I would eat the best first 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 to destroy the air defense I would have 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.180
 just keep clicking because of the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 opponent is just too strong and im 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 end effect you just do not come to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 really a lot because what am I supposed to do with that? 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 attack here now i can now here 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.189
 with a barbarian an archer 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.570
 queen archers only one of the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.740
 attack first four units and then 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.509
 I thought I had the healer behind 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.579
 maybe that helps the air defense too 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.200
 destroy and in the end comes then 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 but were king is too fast 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.700
 destroys my whole units my 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.229
 two-wheelers against the use no chance 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.119
 in a small celebration like songs 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 naturally thought are most in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.570
 rage bell and in fact it still had 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.740
 then I manage the pecker afterwards 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 I thought if that already 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.860
 Of course bakeress exactly because I 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.070
 idiot did not consider that, of course 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.640
 first the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.510
 oh yes, the building outside attacks 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.890
 then that I have the 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.210
 destroyed air defense I would already be the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.920
 dragons and demian still behind 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.090
 then , of course, also how should 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.800
 that would be different the little castle 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.700
 units where you say beautiful 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.470
 Well, strong was yes well classic 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.209
 Strategy clear where no way flashed 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.380
 works really packed has also 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.490
 not complete the kite yet 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.500
 a little bit on it so he 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.459
 at least a little something we destroyed 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.750
 at least a bit dark 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.280
 select from the drill clown 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.100
 maybe do one and the other 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.239
 Destroy it here and so much 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.070
 is not over now anymore 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.640
 we still have the magic to the walküre 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.600
 level four 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 and the one burglar and moreover 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.550
 of course after the jump the james bay 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.410
 but we'll come to that right now 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.940
 I'll see how far the dragon is 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.470
 yes, it is still very far, of course 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 not happiness but there is the tesla 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.180
 no longer acting but up there the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.080
 flight unit anti-aircraft unit since no 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.920
 chance dates come 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.450
 i want a little bit dark elixir 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
 hunt me walküre you destroy 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.780
 Now here's that army camp I'm fine 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.010
 thought maybe she has one 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.420
 a little more harm but you see that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 is really holding out a lot she really has 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.680
 really much so I would not have it 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 they really thought so much 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 I like the simple stuff at all 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.840
 not because firstly it is too expensive 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.320
 after you come the dare yes that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.049
 power from afar ami the archer 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.700
 At the moment I already have the stock 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.299
 it suits me now still beautiful the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.980
 barracks and then three two one thought 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:34.989
 At least that's how I feel 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.480
 a bit and I thought so 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.209
 funny combination wall breakers and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.290
 a spell of wall breaker yes 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.060
 actually let the wall jump 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.730
 and the secret would be real now 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.220
 of course if we immediately right away 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.930
 not ventilated because 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.160
 The man is nearing his goal 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.540
 killed yes what should I say to that 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.800
 except yes, thank you for watching, of course 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.630
 and I think they are the right ones 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.280
 fat out there I once fit the 1 3 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.190
 in the end I do not really have 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 lots of stolen funny looks percent 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.260
 Nevertheless, I agree that you like it 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.490
 but I thought it was funny somehow 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.750
 attack all units 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.410
 I just do not have that case 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.970
 and now you are back 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.320
 Write nice and strong comments 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.489
 I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.989
 fight the week to the next 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.060
 challenge otherwise we will see each other 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.530
 in one of my next videos and me 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.950
 I need her when I see her angle 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.950
 not at all
