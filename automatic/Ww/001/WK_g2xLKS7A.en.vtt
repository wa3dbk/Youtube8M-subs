tricks I'm at a bunch of other need
features<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.150> that's<00:00:12.389> great<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.049> all<00:00:13.170> but

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380

that I hope to see on a lot of new

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.080 
that I hope to see on a lot of new
devices<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:29.039> technology<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.670> talking<00:00:30.029> about

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
devices the technology I'm talking about

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720 
devices the technology I'm talking about
is<00:00:30.480> infrared<00:00:31.349> transmitters<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.550> used

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is infrared transmitters now this used

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.680 
is infrared transmitters now this used
to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.880> used<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> day<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> actually

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
to be used back in the day to actually

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
to be used back in the day to actually
transmit<00:00:34.079> data<00:00:34.500> between<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:35.100> devices<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
transmit data between two devices you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
transmit data between two devices you
line<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> table<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> flat

metal and line up their infrared
transmitters<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> could<00:00:43.680> transfer

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
transmitters and then you could transfer

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
started to see one or two phones that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
started to see one or two phones that
actually<00:00:56.520> had<00:00:56.670> infrared<00:00:57.120> transmitters<00:00:57.629> on

actually had infrared transmitters on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090 
actually had infrared transmitters on
them<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.440> had<00:00:58.530> happened<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:58.980> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
them now what had happened was they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
them now what had happened was they
started<00:00:59.370> using<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.699> software<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.449> order<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
started using a software in order to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
started using a software in order to
make<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> infrared<00:01:02.430> transmitter<00:01:02.969> send<00:01:03.449> data

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
make the infrared transmitter send data

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320 
make the infrared transmitter send data
to<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.589> television<00:01:04.979> set<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.939> same<00:01:06.119> way

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to a television set in much the same way

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740 
to a television set in much the same way
that<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.960> current<00:01:07.590> TV<00:01:07.890> remote<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.750> now

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that your current TV remote does now

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
that your current TV remote does now
this<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.290> great<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.650> allowed<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.189> change

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this was great it allowed you to change

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.920 
this was great it allowed you to change
the<00:01:11.640> channels<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> volume<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.900> a

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
make that useless as well right now the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.510 
make that useless as well right now the
HTC<00:03:52.600> One<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.350> Samsung<00:03:53.770> Galaxy<00:03:53.890> s4<00:03:54.280> are

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy s4 are

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.370 
HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy s4 are
the<00:03:54.610> only<00:03:54.730> two<00:03:54.880> main<00:03:55.209> devices<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.930> have<00:03:56.140> this

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
the only two main devices that have this

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.840 
the only two main devices that have this
new<00:03:56.560> feature<00:03:56.770> but<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.340> think<00:03:57.550> once<00:03:57.760> people

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
new feature but I think once people

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.310 
new feature but I think once people
start<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.240> realize<00:03:58.450> how<00:03:58.480> convenient<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:59.110> is

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
start to realize how convenient this is

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.580 
start to realize how convenient this is
we're<00:03:59.920> gonna<00:04:00.010> start<00:04:00.310> seeing<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.730> lot<00:04:00.760> more

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
we're gonna start seeing it a lot more

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.620 
we're gonna start seeing it a lot more
let's<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.770> hope<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.370> most<00:04:04.300> people<00:04:04.600> use

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
let's just hope that most people use

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.770 
let's just hope that most people use
this<00:04:04.930> feature<00:04:05.140> for<00:04:05.470> good
