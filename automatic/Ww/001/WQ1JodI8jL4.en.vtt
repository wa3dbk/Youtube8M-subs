00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.890
 Good folks, let's take some photos. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 flash software is an artificial light 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:15.470
 certain speed light car wash contagion 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.800
 flash light is used when standing 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 direct 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.529
 Look that soccer is fado and it's a photo 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.230
 which will look very much like light 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.539
 the direct sun is going to have on the hard ones 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.359
 depending on the light intensity of the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 flash will be haunting when it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 a glove enters the front of the ground 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 You do not have that little light. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.879
 more diffused than the illumination becomes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 homogeneous shadow over equals 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.050
 How do we do this to do? 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 this in flash with one of the most 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.989
 cheap leave 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.739
 You 're right to buy an umbrella. 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.070
 Umbrellas umbrellas because the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.039
 diffuser 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.309
 ie it will play the role of the cloud 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.890
 in front of the sun will leave the lighting 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 softer than the guarantor to disclose 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.619
 force on these supports and here you can 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.119
 contract over the internet with the calendar 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.119
 You fit his sound . 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 to 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.770
 the use of the flash will be triggered 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.800
 here will go through the somber will arrive 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.140
 in person any tone to look at it 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:38.040
 I used the flash the use of the flash beats here 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.810
 through the shadowy creates a source 12 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.180
 and there are games where 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.890
 the singer was photographed and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 Then you will notice that the photo is 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.360
 indifferent already posted a photo with only 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.760
 flash and another with the umbrella already 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.760
 for you to see this beauty difference 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.799
 okay 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:25.439
 Robson, what are we doing here? 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 something tripod is play cool ninja show more 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.540
 to put the country there to do 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.280
 with the wife 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.840
 We're working a little light. 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.310
 more diffuse with flash using a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 umbrella an adjustment more or less 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.930
 restrictions have been 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.970
 working as a bar 200 cases 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.420
 including reflex 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.069
 arrow 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.430
 arriving but luckily I found 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.060
 interesting the opening of 7.1 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.069
 I know but you can vary a little bit 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.079
 because sometimes you might want to 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.010
 work a little darker and less 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.290
 more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.959
 Of course, everything depends on what is 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.819
 either with a goal but I think of a 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.010
 simple way using a font welcomed 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.319
 today we can find some 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.680
 very interesting photos when the product 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.389
 people look at our ways 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.139
 was looking to win this record 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.560
 place 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.560
 fine 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:01.370
 We are doing here. 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.099
 look at this composition black or green 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.359
 This here gives you a picture that stays 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.260
 very interesting 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.769
 I had some luck and these leaves that have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.810
 the very strong green along with that black 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.160
 if you work a little bit of the lights 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.329
 lower is also cool in such 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.740
 always look for when to make super 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.680
 photo to make a photograph would she have 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.320
 a point maybe against a text to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.900
 photo exposed because you value 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.210
 plus black and enhance more employment 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.490
 the collage as it is there and here the people 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.090
 is also wearing sweeping haunting 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.470
 and creates a broader and more 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.990
 diffuse 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.360
 Wow, how can we eliminate just to get 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.419
 leaves and also in the way you go. 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.770
 be very interesting and you can see 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.770
 some photos of each city 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 baby 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:15.690
 oh 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:37.450
 there are people better out eleven 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.560
 but I hope you guys have 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:45.080
 Tanned and the photos a few tips 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.720
 now it's watching the videos led light on 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.450
 with the mall gives an improved correct 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.360
 something in the position but we have 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.030
 that using these techniques there for you come 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.790
 increasingly improving the videos is 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.740
 Do you serve the photos? 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.510
 it serves for all in truth now you 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.610
 begin to do the tests 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.330
 these techniques you can use 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.310
 You always want to keep improving. 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.380
 then watch the short videos the channel 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.170
