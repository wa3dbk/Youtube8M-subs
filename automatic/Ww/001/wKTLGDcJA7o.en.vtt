00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
through this test just like a champ so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360 
through this test just like a champ so
now<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.930> time<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.379> smaller<00:00:55.739> drop<00:00:56.100> test

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

now it's time for the smaller drop test
we're<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:56.969> drop<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.719> throw

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we're going to actually drop it or throw

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
we're going to actually drop it or throw
it<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.440> about<00:00:58.710> three<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> four<00:00:59.609> feet<00:00:59.910> high<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it from about three to four feet high so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
it from about three to four feet high so
we're<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we're going to see what is going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
we're going to see what is going to
happen<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> phone<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
happen with the phone as you can see the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
happen with the phone as you can see the
phone<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.280> shape<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.210> back

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
phone is a pretty good shape the back

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
phone is a pretty good shape the back
panel<00:01:06.810> fell<00:01:07.110> off<00:01:07.350> along<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> battery

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
panel fell off along with the battery

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.250 
panel fell off along with the battery
but<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.330> consistent<00:01:10.049> with

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
but that's pretty much consistent with

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.640 
but that's pretty much consistent with
the<00:01:10.409> older<00:01:10.680> phones<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.490> usually<00:01:11.670> tend<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the older phones they usually tend to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
the older phones they usually tend to
you<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.950> decompose<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> back

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you know not decompose but the back

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.030 
you know not decompose but the back
panel<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> battery<00:01:16.200> usually<00:01:16.350> tend<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> come

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
panel the battery usually tend to come

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
panel the battery usually tend to come
off<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> phone<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:18.270> throw<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
drop them that's just a normal thing

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.380 
drop them that's just a normal thing

was<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> actually<00:01:52.500> find<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.340> damn<00:01:53.520> battery

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
was to actually find the damn battery

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.539 
was to actually find the damn battery
because<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:55.259> managed<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> snuck<00:01:56.369> up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
because it just managed to snuck up

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
because it just managed to snuck up
somewhere<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:57.930> sneak<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.259> somewhere

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
somewhere in the or sneak up somewhere

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
somewhere in the or sneak up somewhere
in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.100> bushes<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.850> find<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.390> hard<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

is indestructible those are definitely

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.310 
is indestructible those are definitely
untrue<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.570> thing<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.109> real<00:04:21.289> life

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
untrue but the thing is in real life

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.300 
untrue but the thing is in real life
scenarios<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.220> phone<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.760> damn<00:04:23.300> near

scenario<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:26.960> real<00:04:27.110> life<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.440> would<00:04:27.590> imagine<00:04:27.770> is

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
scenario in real life I would imagine is

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.950 
scenario in real life I would imagine is
dropping<00:04:28.669> your<00:04:28.760> phone<00:04:29.030> from<00:04:29.300> shoulder<00:04:29.720> height

dropping your phone from shoulder height

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.750 
dropping your phone from shoulder height
and<00:04:30.410> this<00:04:30.800> phone<00:04:30.950> could<00:04:31.070> definitely<00:04:31.310> stay<00:04:31.700> in

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
and this phone could definitely stay in

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.760 
and this phone could definitely stay in
such<00:04:32.060> damage<00:04:32.479> so<00:04:32.720> if<00:04:33.080> you're<00:04:33.229> on<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.380> phone<00:04:33.560> as

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
such damage so if you're on the phone as

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.370 
such damage so if you're on the phone as
a<00:04:33.889> backup<00:04:34.580> phone<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.780> want<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.020> use<00:04:36.200> in

a backup phone that you want to use in
dangerous<00:04:36.830> situations<00:04:37.430> or<00:04:37.700> as<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.120> bulletproof

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.480 
dangerous situations or as a bulletproof
phone<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.110> would<00:04:39.500> definitely<00:04:39.889> recommend<00:04:39.979> it
