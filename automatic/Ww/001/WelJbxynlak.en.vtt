00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 what is the fear of advice are 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.450
 ratified in the bar 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.789
 notifications because today you're going to 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.470
 show how we can change it 

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:10.570
 color according to the place where we are as 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.160
 we see there it is in orange color between a 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.160
 for example in the whatsapp it is already put in 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.199
 a darker color darker we enter 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.460
 for example on twitter and we see that it 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.589
 it turns blue 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.789
 a while ago this I taught him good the 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.800
 truth is that I do not know so much ac I think 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.859
 One week I taught it how you 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.689
 can do but the only downside that there was 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.970
 was that he had to have the device 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.550
 rooted and today in this video I teach you 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.280
 how to achieve this effect without 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.690
 rootear our device and if you 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.640
 like the content this video I invite you 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 appear also very interesting besides 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.580
 I would like to send greetings to creel psuv 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.280

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.140
 Youtube that is dedicated to games can 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.000

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.300
 videos and the truth is that believe me 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.070
 Cheers a lot, many greetings for you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.140

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.840
 Greetings to all who are 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.130
 arriving little by little and start with the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.759
 tutorial 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.759
 i 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.650
 good the application that we are going to use 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.420
 it's called useless is an application that 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.370
 it's paid in the google play but not 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 do not worry do not worry because you 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.690
 You can get it for free in the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.010
 act and see if you do not know what betrayed me 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.870
 I leave you in the description of the video a 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.170
 Article on our website in which 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.450
 we talk about him and we teach how 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.830
 use it and how to download it so 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.770
 good once you've pirated the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.680
 I'm not 'application and for the apt and 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.480
 of already we will be able to use it and good 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.010
 first of all to be able to download 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.240
 any application that is outside the 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 google play we will have to go to the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.720
 adjustments come to the security section and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.760
 activate where you put unknown origins 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.980
 we give him to accept and this is what we 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.990
 will allow is to download as I have already 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.360
 said apps that are not inside 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.880
 of google play that we are going to need 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 to install the car and ibi 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.070
 piratearnos line or tino in case 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.530
 you do not want to pay it good we go with the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.750
 line or you enter it and we will have to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.980
 give it to enable to useless there are two 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.110
 sections that we have to enable the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.130
 accessibility section 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.450
 we look in the useless and we enable it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.250
 we go backwards we go backwards from 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 new and we can see that it is activated now 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.920
 would be the notifications we activate the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.960
 access to the useless notifications and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.620
 we have already put the bar 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.870
 notifications of the color that we are in 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.610
 according to the place where we are not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.470
 well let's make suits if we want 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.060
 we could have him show us the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.099
 signal strength on this bar 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.980
 notifications that we die that we 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.409
 shows the percentage of battery and good 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 small adjustments there is one thing that I do not 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.590
 like this application and through itself 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.430
 because I do not like to be lying here 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.200
 in my videos is that the line or you as 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.209
 the notification bar when it is 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.620
 on the home screen is not displayed 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.989
 transparent color but it is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 It shows in white to me you see me in 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.430
 red color because I'm using the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.079
 nova launcher as we see we go to the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 nova launcher configuration and how 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.280
 is a the settings are in red then 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.220
 it comes to me in red if for example 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.359
 we change to the launcher that comes from good 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.120
 which is predetermined in me 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.319
 device let's go to that launcher 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.019
 as we see this would be the launcher that 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.760
 comes in definition that comes 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.030
 predetermined that he says then I already 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.799
 would appear in color in white not 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.060
 there is something that maybe we do not like 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.250
 a lot but for example if we enter 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.530
 whatsapp or if we enter any 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.209
 application because we would already change the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.950
 color as we see we get the color 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.010
 automatic in the application where 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.569
 let's be 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.159
 and good little more to say about this 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.959
 application simply that when 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.040
 let's download the notification bar in 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.989
 where in the first section we 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.549
 we will find a section that will be for 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.260
 the calendar and dates but if 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.000
 we can go to the second section where 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.610
 says everything and so we will meet 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.280
 all notifications other than 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.950
 I would like to say about this bar 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.090
 notifications that if we slide once 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.579
 logically it will unfold to us but if 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.920
 we slide once again we will unfold 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.410
 our native notification bar 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.430
 of our android device and up 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.590
 that the video of how you already know 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.389
 we try to help all users 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.250
 we previously did the video of how 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.229
 do it by the rooted device and 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.240
 as many of you asked me to be able 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.030
 do it without the device rooted here 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.260
 we have brought the tutorial logically 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.830
 logically it has its pros and has its 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.770
 cons but good I explain it to you and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.169
 I hope you can take advantage of it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 so I say goodbye I hope that I have 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.620
 liked you can leave us what you want 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.629
 in the comments that you know me 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.190
 I like to read it is to go talking with 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.509
