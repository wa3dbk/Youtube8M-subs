00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.390
 for everyone welcome back to the channel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.100
 and good I'll be honest, like 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.770
 one week I saw a trick to pass 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.830
 any car to friends and the truth 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.990
 is that it was a trick but I and apparently 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.750
 nobody else has had the most holy ones 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 how could we get out then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 exaggerate, trying as you can imagine 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.410
 hundreds of combinations at the end 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 get to pass the dust to this new 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.939
 six by six to anyone who like 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 you'll know you can only have it from 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 level 100 so guys the tricks 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 they leave as they come out and in this case we are going to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 need to be three the one that will happen to you 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 car you who receive it and a third 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.609
 friend so I ask you to leave your 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.590
 ideas for the comments since apart 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.109
 to help sure you'll do good 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 friends so what I said and as always 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.129
 if you want to know how this is done 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.519
 piece of trick do not move that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.519
 we started 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.780
 so good so that the trick does not go to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.030
 the perfection the friend that is going to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.190
 Pass the car you have to invite us to your 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.650
 departure and each one of us 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.080
 we have to have the place of appearance 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.610
 in last location then it is 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.830
 very important if the one that is going to happen to you 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 the car has as in this case the house 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.840
 of 500 thousand us in the same block 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.810
 instead of that we should have 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.180
 any other so good second 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.039
 point the six by six will be replaced 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.979
 for the vehicle that we have in that 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.960
 plaza so guys make sure you have 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.179
 one that you do not want so we continue 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 everyone in his garage, I'm the one 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.319
 wants the car I will ride 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.860
 companion and our third friend in my 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.390
 case it will be us that will ride right behind 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 well it's not that here is behind me 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.700
 let's change character leaving the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.380
 screen is in black so it's worth now 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 what will happen to us the car will have to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.240
 press start and you will have to go to the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.880
 store either of play or of xbox that gives what 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.560
 same now once it's there it's not going to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 touch nothing else with which we 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.090
 we will cancel and we will become 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.750
 driver, nothing, we are going to move the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 wheels 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.520
 with the analog and then we will press the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.860
 stars on line and we will change character 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.750
 Well, guys, we're already there since it was 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.730
 the last step is that it is not here that is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.100
 the friend who follows the game is going to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.320
 invite again to her then untouched 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.820
 nothing here we will go to the messages and 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.430
 we accept your invitation 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.040
 so once I finally upload the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.990
 online when entering our garage will be 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.790
 our friend played with the car but 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.860
 High does not work before doing anything 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.770
 We will invite again to whoever is 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.720
 happening since he follows in the store the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.030
 guys now already so if I can give by 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.650
 finished this trick and that is in the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
 moment you are in the game 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.660
 we can take 6 for 6 without problems 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.090
 that as you will see you will disappear nothing 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.640
 guys you go back to the garage and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.160
 you will have it finally I do not know if it is 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.440
 assured but otherwise I think that 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.840
 it's a trick so feeling it a lot 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.570
