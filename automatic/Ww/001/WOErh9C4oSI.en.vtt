it's<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.580> very<00:03:09.790> safe<00:03:10.060> opener<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.720> there<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.350> go

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
it's a very safe opener and there you go

is<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.720> banshees<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.650> as<00:03:21.400> we<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.880> plainly

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
is going banshees and as we can plainly

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420 
is going banshees and as we can plainly
see<00:03:22.600> there's<00:03:23.079> there's<00:03:23.440> almost<00:03:23.709> no<00:03:24.070> scouting

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
see there's there's almost no scouting

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.410 
see there's there's almost no scouting
going<00:03:24.820> on<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.980> Terran<00:03:27.519> base<00:03:27.700> MC<00:03:28.150> has<00:03:28.239> done

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
going on in the Terran base MC has done

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.390 
going on in the Terran base MC has done
very<00:03:28.450> little<00:03:28.750> scouting<00:03:29.230> at<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.530> point<00:03:29.829> so

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
very little scouting at this point so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.300 
very little scouting at this point so
yeah<00:03:31.090> it's<00:03:31.299> definitely<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.840> be

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
yeah it's definitely going to be

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.220 
yeah it's definitely going to be
pretty<00:03:32.970> pivotal<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.450> get<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.720> observer<00:03:33.989> out

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
