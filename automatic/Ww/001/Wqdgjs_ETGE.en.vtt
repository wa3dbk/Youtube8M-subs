try to install this real quick I have

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
try to install this real quick I have
one<00:02:01.590> complaint<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.130> far<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.210> didn't<00:02:03.540> line

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
one complaint so far that it didn't line

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.209 
one complaint so far that it didn't line
up<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.320> wasn't<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.710> great<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
up right here it wasn't that great and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
up right here it wasn't that great and
even<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.640> tried<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.119> best<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:07.259> was<00:02:07.380> not

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
even I tried my best but it was not

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.839 
even I tried my best but it was not
working<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.280> messed<00:02:08.520> they're

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
working I think they messed they're

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
working I think they messed they're
cupped<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.780> their<00:02:09.929> cutouts<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.440> there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
cupped on their cutouts right there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
cupped on their cutouts right there
but<00:02:11.990> pretty<00:02:12.990> much<00:02:13.050> everything<00:02:13.410> else<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.770> kind

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
but pretty much everything else is kind

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.240 
but pretty much everything else is kind
of<00:02:14.520> great<00:02:14.690> also<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.900> their<00:02:16.170> cutouts<00:02:17.100> for

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
of great also about their cutouts for

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910 
of great also about their cutouts for
the<00:02:17.810> analog<00:02:18.810> stick<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:19.800> if

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the analog stick I think that's what if

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
the analog stick I think that's what if
they're<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.280> stick<00:02:20.550> right<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
they're all stick right here it was a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.390 
they're all stick right here it was a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
hopefully it doesn't collapse on us that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
hopefully it doesn't collapse on us that
one<00:02:31.860> mess<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> camera<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.300> we're<00:02:33.450> gonna

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
one mess up the camera so we're gonna

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.780 
one mess up the camera so we're gonna
install<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.020> inside<00:02:34.350> real<00:02:34.530> quick<00:02:34.730> anyway<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
install the inside real quick anyway the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.390 
install the inside real quick anyway the
falls<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.240> just<00:02:36.480> catch<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.900> hopefully<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
falls i can just catch it hopefully so

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.140 
falls i can just catch it hopefully so
we're<00:02:38.580> installed<00:02:38.970> inside<00:02:39.440> first<00:02:40.790> looks<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
we're installed inside first looks and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.600 
we're installed inside first looks and
looks<00:02:42.600> real<00:02:42.810> nice<00:02:42.960> so<00:02:43.800> here's<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> first<00:02:44.160> flaw

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
looks real nice so here's the first flaw

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.050 
looks real nice so here's the first flaw
it<00:02:45.150> does<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:45.660> go<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.710> there<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.160> cutout<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.790> too

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it does not go in there a cutout is too

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.960 
it does not go in there a cutout is too
small<00:02:48.450> i<00:02:49.250> love<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.370> guys<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.610> see<00:02:50.790> they're

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
right I mean this kind of is definitely

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.020

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
trying to pawn these but these cutouts

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.410 
trying to pawn these but these cutouts
look<00:03:25.140> great<00:03:25.520> but<00:03:26.520> just<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.000> only<00:03:27.090> thing<00:03:27.300> is

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420

right<00:03:27.630> here<00:03:27.840> with<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:29.490> they<00:03:29.580> try<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
right here with this I think they try to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.000 
right here with this I think they try to
be<00:03:29.940> too<00:03:30.120> precise<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.870> they<00:03:31.290> didn't<00:03:31.890> quite

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
be too precise and they didn't quite

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.670 
be too precise and they didn't quite
work<00:03:32.160> out<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.640> them<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:34.050> if<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> ask<00:03:34.530> them

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
work out for them but if you ask them

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.230 
work out for them but if you ask them
