00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
is this skyscraper is coming down one

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.640 
is this skyscraper is coming down one
hundred<00:00:28.869> percent<00:00:28.900> here<00:00:29.349> you<00:00:29.439> can<00:00:29.529> actually

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
hundred percent here you can actually

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.290 
hundred percent here you can actually
see<00:00:29.830> it<00:00:29.980> up<00:00:30.099> that<00:00:30.550> there<00:00:30.730> was<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.849> little<00:00:31.060> bit<00:00:31.210> of

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
see it up that there was a little bit of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.299 
see it up that there was a little bit of
an<00:00:31.449> altercation<00:00:31.840> of<00:00:32.230> tops<00:00:32.559> but<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.160> is

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
an altercation of tops but it is

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.890 
an altercation of tops but it is
definitely<00:00:33.550> going<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.089> be<00:00:34.180> raining<00:00:34.420> death<00:00:34.690> and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
definitely going to be raining death and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.380 
definitely going to be raining death and
destruction<00:00:35.019> and<00:00:35.620> look<00:00:35.890> at<00:00:36.010> its<00:00:36.129> alpha<00:00:36.519> 0<00:00:36.550> 5<00:00:36.940> 10

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
destruction and look at its alpha 0 5 10

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.380 
destruction and look at its alpha 0 5 10
kills<00:00:37.719> two<00:00:38.050> deaths<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.530> like<00:00:38.890> that<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:39.129> lot<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
kills two deaths I like that a lot you

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.360 
kills two deaths I like that a lot you
know<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.780> course<00:00:40.840> in<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.680> armor<00:00:42.160> in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
know of course in the in the armor in

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.310 
know of course in the in the armor in
the<00:00:42.399> tank<00:00:42.820> good<00:00:43.420> positioning<00:00:43.899> in<00:00:44.020> here<00:00:44.140> comes

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
the tank good positioning in here comes

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.400 
the tank good positioning in here comes
the<00:00:44.410> sky<00:00:44.590> scalar<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.329> so<00:00:46.840> for<00:00:47.079> those<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.230> you

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
the sky scalar and so for those of you

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.360 
the sky scalar and so for those of you
that<00:00:47.559> are<00:00:47.680> questioning<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.100> don't<00:00:48.250> know<00:00:48.309> I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
that are questioning I don't know I

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.010 
that are questioning I don't know I
think<00:00:48.520> we<00:00:48.730> mentioned<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:49.149> couple<00:00:49.329> times<00:00:49.510> so<00:00:49.989> far

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
think we mentioned a couple times so far

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.529 
think we mentioned a couple times so far
but<00:00:51.010> if<00:00:51.070> you're<00:00:51.160> just<00:00:51.489> now<00:00:51.640> tuning<00:00:51.969> in<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> one

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
but if you're just now tuning in the one

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
but if you're just now tuning in the one
way<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.870> take<00:00:53.079> out<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.379> skyscraper

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
way that you take out this skyscraper

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.119 
way that you take out this skyscraper
and<00:00:54.910> here<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.329> siege<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:56.050> Shanghai<00:00:56.710> there<00:00:57.039> are

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
and here on siege of Shanghai there are

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.849 
and here on siege of Shanghai there are
four<00:00:57.430> pillars<00:00:57.969> that<00:00:58.210> are<00:00:58.719> well<00:00:59.109> defined<00:00:59.440> on

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
four pillars that are well defined on

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.799 
four pillars that are well defined on
the<00:00:59.890> fact<00:01:00.129> that<00:01:00.250> they're<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.699> stable<00:01:01.210> or

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
the fact that they're in stable or

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.139 
the fact that they're in stable or
unstable<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.530> end<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.039> can<00:01:03.160> see<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.399> too

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
unstable the end you can see that too

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.050 
unstable the end you can see that too
highly<00:01:04.960> explosive<00:01:05.320> rockets<00:01:06.160> you<00:01:06.759> can<00:01:06.910> have

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
highly explosive rockets you can have

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.419 
highly explosive rockets you can have
some<00:01:07.330> artillery<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:08.110> may<00:01:08.229> even<00:01:08.440> some<00:01:09.009> tanks

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
some artillery you may even some tanks

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.040 
some artillery you may even some tanks
that<00:01:10.000> are<00:01:10.060> shooting<00:01:10.479> at<00:01:10.569> those<00:01:10.690> pillars

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
that are shooting at those pillars

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.919 
that are shooting at those pillars
usually<00:01:11.470> takes<00:01:11.679> two<00:01:11.950> shots<00:01:12.280> per<00:01:12.610> pillar<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.840> be

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
usually takes two shots per pillar to be

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.809 
usually takes two shots per pillar to be
able<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.170> take<00:01:14.319> down<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.619> skyscraper<00:01:15.039> we<00:01:15.580> see

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
able to take down that skyscraper we see

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.809 
able to take down that skyscraper we see
how<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.420> LEvolution<00:01:17.410> has<00:01:17.560> altered<00:01:18.190> but

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
how the LEvolution has altered but

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.300 
how the LEvolution has altered but
gameplay<00:01:19.360> going<00:01:20.289> into<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.590> later<00:01:20.890> part<00:01:21.220> of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
gameplay going into this later part of

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.059 
gameplay going into this later part of
this<00:01:21.429> map<00:01:21.670> yeah<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.720> again<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.530> know<00:01:23.649> bring

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
this map yeah and again you know bring

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.669 
this map yeah and again you know bring
up<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.490> dust<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.479> brought<00:01:26.050> up<00:01:26.289> because

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
up the dust that is brought up because

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.740 
up the dust that is brought up because
the<00:01:26.800> building<00:01:27.250> coming<00:01:27.550> down<00:01:27.880> here<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.630> know

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
the building coming down here you know

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.600 
the building coming down here you know
that<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.039> thing<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.340> you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
that is the that is the thing that you

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.309 
that is the that is the thing that you
have<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.880> keep<00:01:31.179> in<00:01:31.360> mind<00:01:31.569> how<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.869> just

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
have to keep in mind how it just

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.699 
have to keep in mind how it just
dramatically<00:01:32.979> affects<00:01:33.429> gameplay<00:01:34.380> air<00:01:35.380> air

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
dramatically affects gameplay air air

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.699 
dramatically affects gameplay air air
units<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.399> not<00:01:36.700> as<00:01:36.940> effective<00:01:37.750> because<00:01:38.349> of

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
units are not as effective because of

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.219 
units are not as effective because of
the<00:01:38.770> fact<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.789> dust<00:01:40.149> surrounding<00:01:40.479> here

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the fact that this dust surrounding here

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.930 
the fact that this dust surrounding here
and<00:01:41.380> look<00:01:41.560> at<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:41.679> as<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> lone<00:01:42.640> guy

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
and look at this as what is a lone guy

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.850 
and look at this as what is a lone guy
well<00:01:43.270> that's<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.690> smart<00:01:43.959> move<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.410> right
