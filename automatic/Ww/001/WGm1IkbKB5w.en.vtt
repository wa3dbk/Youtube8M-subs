00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi everyone guys and welcome well 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.420
 found as usual in the world of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.250
 I am always reading it here 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.500
 as usual to give you some precious ones 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 suggestions to overcome the assault yes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 call night the night we will see today 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 together what the nexus 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.789
 like every week I always recommend you 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.289
 of against those who are i 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 active modifiers for example in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 in this case the doctor is active 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.350
 brace modifier of the sun ie all 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 weapons with damage on life year from 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 fire have the damage multiplier 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.750
 so that means go get you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 weapons that do fire damage for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.660
 example in this case I use that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.840
 that a great need for confluence 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 combined with a Mr Hyde break for 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 be able to find a great reward 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 a great class that would let me 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.710
 have a sniper like yours 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.480
 substantially infinite communications 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 that really did a lot of damage in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.170
 very precise primary with what it is 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.969
 a fortunately elemental damage such as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 the one from fire if you had no vision 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.180
 confluence of eni toklas di sono 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.770
 rather I think they are just these 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 two weapons that I do not see this 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.260
 moment lives in comment in these 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 however if he had a primary with 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.219
 damage to the mental is equipped 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 above all only 6 of fire like 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.920
 then face nexus we go immediately to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 see how you saw this first 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.979
 area where you must must 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 destroy the first three servants of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.619
 I recommend that maybe in the area that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.510
 we have been this because why 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 basically in a whole year 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.799
 and I never say the enemies of facts in this one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 area you will never see any enemy 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.700
 come in maybe there could be a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.590
 knight who follows you or excuse me more 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 that a knight a captain happened 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 that follows you but never leaves unless 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.210
 which as in this case to go to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.189
 flushing out the servant was right 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.049
 in that area you can go out but never 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 get too far away and how many always a 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.189
 return to that safe area that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.159
 will represent your salvation spot 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.020
 and spot say premetto finished this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.549
 back to the first zone you go back up the stairs 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 the vandals that come down will come 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.000
 I recommend maybe with a missile launcher 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 like this maybe this revenge here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.060
 of aziz you shoot a missile where there 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.710
 they are all 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.720
 all to be able to close the majority 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 part other solution is this small one 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.799
 tripp that I recommend you can skip 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.970
 this whole area is rather here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.640
 to shoot in this way you see it 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.200
 doing as it shows with this jump 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 you see in front of it you can jump 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.590
 the whole area and possibly avoid 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.170
 even even shooting at enemies 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.759
 rather than maybe a one-point spare 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.009
 substantially more advantageous 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's move on to another important point from 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.180
 see this area together 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.489
 where different gobins and two hunchbacks tone each other 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.769
 hunchback major and minotaurs 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.940
 I tend to move 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.069
 always on the right I find more 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.989
 simple and can also be addressed in 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.880
 left area as you see at this 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.440
 point we set ourselves of the sniper we eliminate 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.209
 immediately what the buildings are 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.310
 let's continue so we also eliminate the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.040
 minotauri and I must say that rather 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.230
 quickly enough I remember it from 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.810
 have increased from the fire is never 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.000
 then the deputies ' shields are empty 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 a vacuum weapon easily removes it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.569
 shield a firearm 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400
 eliminate it eliminates that threat 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.280
 less table and here we are in the area 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.569
 final as also said this horde of 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.829
 goblin can be said to be rather straightforward 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.720
 quickly maybe if you had a 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.730
 Shoot them in those 10 shots 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.280
 20 goblins that all turned out to be 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.799
 here we are how to face the nexus there 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.910
 let's throw down the nexus you don't have to 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.709
 face from below 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.239
 never ever inca the night because there 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.290
 below is much more difficult then us 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.239
 we will have to stay in this elevated area 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.799
 to give first is to kill the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.630
 minotauri where he does not give us everything 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.299
 involuntary to expose and or better 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.859
 the nexus is for the nexus is opening 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.170
 how many times have you heard it intertwine 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.269
 as you saw after we killed 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.569
 these enemies we can then source in 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.000
 next march small small voltage like 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.790
 see comino table axis at the moment in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.440
 where the team was stationed above 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.180
 keep playing your shoulders 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.130
 what is a minute awacs right for 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.989
 going to disturb you is not a problem 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.430
 the important thing is to lend rather 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.430
 be careful always pay attention to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.840
 share the slightest shuttles every 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.250
 a little less than every minute of there is one 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.129
 thirty seconds more or less weight 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.480
 maybe even have a minute and let's say 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.629
 you should do it pretty quickly 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.280
 as you see with the light eagle 10 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.290
 millions give look how long it lasts 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.969
 this nexus really nothing maybe is 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.310
 truly one of the easiest assaults 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.530
 nexus seen we lived it easily 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.450
 as usual a good team a good one 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.430
 team vs as usual composed of a 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.260
 titan and a sorcerer at least the sorcerer 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.939
 will allow you to have a person who 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.590
 for you can revive the titan will give you 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.819
 way to have a bubble with light weapons 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.590
 to go to internal increase of 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.519
 the whole team and the hunter is 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.370
 just because we have that hunter 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.139
 the Indian team is a loser 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.400
 having said this nothing this is all for 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.780
 this video from me this year 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.030
 this year this week 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.199
 pretty well I unlocked now not 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.389
 you will see it for this best done 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.070
 only for the unlocked video remote control 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 universal then I also found an ice 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.310
 breaker on the second character I have 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.930
 dismantled because I already had and with the third 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.520
 only ascending fragments that goes well 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.780
 also useful to you as you go to 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.820
 this holy week what you have the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.440
 After the cool one, ask me below 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 or rather dear night below weekly 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.370
 different and we get the next one 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.680
 with militant posts I always recommend 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.599
 let a nice like share the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.340
 video with your friends next guides 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.570
 coming they will come they will come 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.820
 that maybe some information on 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.409
 recent patch that has changed 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.810
 the game is also very game economy 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.889
 and that I really like where it really is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.760
 much enough 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.760
 I greet you next time
