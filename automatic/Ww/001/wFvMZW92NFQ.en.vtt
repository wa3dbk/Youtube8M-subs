00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
special ability is that he throws a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
special ability is that he throws a
blade<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> map<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.500> destroy<00:00:25.890> support

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
blade over the map in destroy support

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060 
blade over the map in destroy support
and<00:00:26.880> damage<00:00:27.480> everything<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.410> area<00:00:28.800> where

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and damage everything in this area where

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
and damage everything in this area where

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it gets thrown and then attacked the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
it gets thrown and then attacked the
forest<00:00:31.800> enemy<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.369> his<00:00:32.550> cool<00:00:33.090> animations

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
forest enemy with his cool animations

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
forest enemy with his cool animations
that's<00:00:34.350> really<00:00:34.649> good<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.950> combination<00:00:35.520> with

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's really good in combination with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
that's really good in combination with
pan<00:00:35.820> goli<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.960> 5<00:00:37.260> heroes

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
pan goli because they are just 5 heroes

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.430 
pan goli because they are just 5 heroes
and<00:00:37.920> pancali<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.579> hit<00:00:38.760> 4<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.660> he<00:00:39.809> hit<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.230> 4

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and pancali can hit 4 so he hit the 4

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
and pancali can hit 4 so he hit the 4
need<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> phoniest<00:00:41.190> targets<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> then

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
need the phoniest targets and then

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.660 
need the phoniest targets and then
arctic<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.260> attack<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> first<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
arctic lot can attack the first one the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
arctic lot can attack the first one the
damage<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.230> Pandora's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
damage is pretty well so like Pandora's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.040 
damage is pretty well so like Pandora's
damage<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.789> don't<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> don't<00:00:48.629> really

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
damage but I don't know I don't really

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
damage but I don't know I don't really
like<00:00:49.350> him<00:00:49.559> yes<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> ability<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.940> bad<00:00:51.180> but

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
like him yes this ability is not bad but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
like him yes this ability is not bad but
also<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> strong<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.280> he

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
also it's not that strong because he

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.270 
also it's not that strong because he
it's<00:00:53.820> only<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.390> hero<00:00:54.660> target<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.980> does

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it's only one hero target and don't does

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.880 
it's only one hero target and don't does
like<00:00:56.670> pan<00:00:56.940> goli<00:00:57.149> also<00:00:57.840> fire<00:00:58.079> damage<00:00:58.500> after

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
like pan goli also fire damage after

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
like pan goli also fire damage after
that<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> rating<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.090> use<00:01:00.270> him<00:01:00.539> instead<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that so in rating I use him instead of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
that so in rating I use him instead of
ebiz<00:01:01.289> demon<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.890> air<00:01:02.399> base<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:03.120> good

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
ebiz demon but air base is also good

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
ebiz demon but air base is also good
hero<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.170> hard<00:01:04.350> decision<00:01:04.500> who<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> them

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
hero so it's a hard decision who of them

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
hero so it's a hard decision who of them
is<00:01:05.400> better<00:01:05.610> his<00:01:06.000> eight<00:01:06.210> skill<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.049> good

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
is better his eight skill is really good

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
is better his eight skill is really good
for<00:01:07.500> defending<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.630> him

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
for defending because let's just put him

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.160 
for defending because let's just put him
on<00:01:09.840> pan<00:01:10.049> goli<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.970> on<00:01:11.970> school<00:01:12.420> level<00:01:12.630> 12<00:01:12.930> he

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on pan goli he on school level 12 he

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
on pan goli he on school level 12 he
recovers<00:01:13.650> 5%<00:01:14.369> health<00:01:14.610> per<00:01:14.850> second<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
recovers 5% health per second so that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
recovers 5% health per second so that
means<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.229> pan<00:01:16.500> goli<00:01:16.740> gets<00:01:17.400> hit<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:18.090> another

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
means if pan goli gets hit from another

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
means if pan goli gets hit from another
enemy<00:01:18.659> pan<00:01:19.049> goli<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.100> am<00:01:20.189> defending<00:01:20.520> pan

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
enemy pan goli so if I am defending pan

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.719 
enemy pan goli so if I am defending pan
goli<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.689> recovers<00:01:22.229> himself<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:23.220> until

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
goli just recovers himself back until

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
goli just recovers himself back until
they<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.150> able<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.540> attack<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.200> pan<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
they are able to attack my pan and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
they are able to attack my pan and
that's<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.520> nice<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> first

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that's really nice so for the first

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
that's really nice so for the first
impression<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> best<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.579> about

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
impression that's the best thing about

seconds<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> mean<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> first

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360

seconds I don't know I mean in the first
10<00:01:54.659> seconds<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.619> happening<00:01:56.070> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
10 seconds there is not happening so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
10 seconds there is not happening so
much<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.469> if

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
much and I think it would be better if

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
much and I think it would be better if
they<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.250> doing<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.729> after<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.930> hero<00:02:01.200> lost

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
more sense but okay so without his

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
he's not really Wofford to switch to him

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.940 
he's not really Wofford to switch to him
instead<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.750> another<00:02:13.959> hero<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.530> pink<00:02:14.799> or

really want to reach his divine ability

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.520 
really want to reach his divine ability
but<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.700> have<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.239> get<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.629> in<00:02:25.780> my<00:02:25.870> hundred<00:02:26.049> K<00:02:26.379> if

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
but I have to get one in my hundred K if

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890 
but I have to get one in my hundred K if

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
I want to reach that on evolve free he

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.559 
I want to reach that on evolve free he
increases<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.470> reaper<00:02:29.980> ATK<00:02:30.670> by<00:02:30.879> 10<00:02:31.120> percent

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
increases the reaper ATK by 10 percent

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.750 
increases the reaper ATK by 10 percent
and<00:02:31.720> 2<00:02:32.200> hp<00:02:32.680> by<00:02:32.829> 50%

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and 2 hp by 50%

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.750 
and 2 hp by 50%
if<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.150> reaper<00:02:34.390> dies<00:02:34.599> he'll<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.290> reincarnated

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
if the reaper dies he'll be reincarnated

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
if the reaper dies he'll be reincarnated
on<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.000> point<00:02:37.299> as<00:02:37.569> another<00:02:37.900> act<00:02:38.170> ignored<00:02:38.560> so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
on that point as another act ignored so

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.369 
on that point as another act ignored so
that<00:02:39.159> sounds<00:02:39.610> not<00:02:39.790> bad<00:02:39.819> but<00:02:40.329> his<00:02:40.629> 8th<00:02:40.900> skill<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
that sounds not bad but his 8th skill is

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.589 
that sounds not bad but his 8th skill is
bet<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.680> defending<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.549> think<00:02:42.819> if<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.420> reach

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
bet on defending I think if you reach

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.080 
bet on defending I think if you reach
his<00:02:43.870> divine<00:02:44.230> skill<00:02:44.620> he<00:02:44.950> will<00:02:45.099> be<00:02:45.370> immune<00:02:45.730> for

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
his divine skill he will be immune for

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.069 
his divine skill he will be immune for
attacks<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:47.319> 10<00:02:47.769> seconds<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:49.150> he<00:02:49.569> deals<00:02:49.810> a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
attacks for 10 seconds and he deals a

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.069 
attacks for 10 seconds and he deals a
lot<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.319> damage<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.670> 8<00:02:51.910> enemies<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
lot of damage so to 8 enemies with the

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.830 
lot of damage so to 8 enemies with the
highest<00:02:53.230> HP<00:02:53.530> he<00:02:54.160> does<00:02:54.340> 60%<00:02:55.239> damage<00:02:55.629> of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
highest HP he does 60% damage of

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.770 
highest HP he does 60% damage of
whatever<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.190> max<00:02:57.430> HP<00:02:57.730> from<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.359> attacked

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
whatever the max HP from the attacked

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.440 
whatever the max HP from the attacked
getting<00:02:59.349> erroneous<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.400> he<00:03:00.970> will<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.239> more

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
getting erroneous so he will do more

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.500 
getting erroneous so he will do more
damage<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:02.319> he<00:03:02.409> hits<00:03:02.890> an<00:03:03.220> outlet<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.209> if<00:03:04.390> he

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
damage if he hits an outlet and if he

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.300 
damage if he hits an outlet and if he
hits<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:04.900> pi<00:03:05.049> repeat<00:03:05.379> because<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> pound<00:03:06.069> has

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
hits in pi repeat because a pound has

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.559 
hits in pi repeat because a pound has
more<00:03:06.579> HP<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.989> 60%<00:03:08.590> from<00:03:09.280> pounders<00:03:09.970> HP<00:03:10.420> is

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
more HP and so 60% from pounders HP is

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.800 
more HP and so 60% from pounders HP is
more<00:03:10.870> than<00:03:11.109> 16%<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:12.280> pyro<00:03:12.700> Pete<00:03:12.940> HP<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:13.690> think

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
more than 16% of pyro Pete HP so I think

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.990 
more than 16% of pyro Pete HP so I think
that's<00:03:14.290> about<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.829> count<00:03:15.220> down<00:03:15.489> what<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.849> guys

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
that's about it count down what you guys

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.210 
that's about it count down what you guys

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
think about a new hero and don't forget

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.409 
think about a new hero and don't forget
