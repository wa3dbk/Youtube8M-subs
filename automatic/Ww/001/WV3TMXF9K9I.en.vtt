it down does not come with a control
with<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.909> mod<00:02:24.720> yeah<00:02:25.409> doesn't<00:02:26.129> come<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
with a mod yeah doesn't come with a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.390 
with a mod yeah doesn't come with a
clicker<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.060> isn't<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.659> remote<00:02:28.400> but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you can buy one you buy the regular ps3

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470 
you can buy one you buy the regular ps3
one<00:02:31.829> actually<00:02:32.159> I<00:02:32.189> think<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.879> it<00:02:33.060> works

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
one actually I think it is and it works

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.009 
one actually I think it is and it works
on<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.799> your<00:02:35.069> ps3<00:02:35.810> interesting<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
on it and on your ps3 interesting that

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.520 
on it and on your ps3 interesting that
they<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.409> that<00:02:37.909> but<00:02:38.909> otherwise<00:02:39.530> let's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
they would do that but otherwise let's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.199 
they would do that but otherwise let's

see oh it's got a weird you're gonna
figure<00:03:28.919> out<00:03:29.040> how<00:03:29.159> to<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.459> if<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.180> get

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
figure out how to do this if you get

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.470 
figure out how to do this if you get
really<00:03:30.629> high<00:03:31.549> it's<00:03:32.549> really<00:03:32.760> bright<00:03:33.000> yes<00:03:33.209> and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
really high it's really bright yes and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.390 
really high it's really bright yes and
nice<00:03:33.659> but<00:03:34.199> you'll<00:03:34.349> notice<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.799> edges<00:03:35.220> get

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
nice but you'll notice the edges get

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.330 
nice but you'll notice the edges get
really<00:03:35.940> white<00:03:36.419> on<00:03:36.659> it<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.129> bleed<00:03:38.129> through

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
really white on it and bleed through

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.339 
really white on it and bleed through
becomes<00:03:38.730> kind<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.030> an<00:03:39.150> issue<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.319> I

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
becomes kind of an issue on it so I

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.439 
becomes kind of an issue on it so I
usually<00:03:40.650> try<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.069> keep<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.579> little<00:03:41.790> low

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
usually try to keep it a little low

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.589 
usually try to keep it a little low
other<00:03:42.900> than<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.940> when<00:03:44.940> your<00:03:45.060> watch<00:03:45.209> when

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
other than the when your watch when

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.399 
other than the when your watch when
you're<00:03:45.750> watching<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.229> 3d<00:03:47.629> type<00:03:48.629> thing<00:03:48.989> it's

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
you're watching a 3d type thing it's

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.520 
you're watching a 3d type thing it's
kind<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.769> nice<00:03:49.979> to<00:03:50.220> have<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:51.169> kind<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.319> high

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
kind of nice to have it kind of high

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.580 
kind of nice to have it kind of high
because<00:03:53.069> 3d<00:03:53.849> glasses<00:03:54.180> reduce<00:03:55.079> light<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.500> yeah

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
because 3d glasses reduce light to yeah

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.979 
because 3d glasses reduce light to yeah
because<00:03:55.829> they're<00:03:56.099> flickering<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.510> appears

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
because they're flickering so it appears

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.960 
because they're flickering so it appears
to<00:03:58.049> us<00:03:58.169> like<00:03:58.560> they're<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.010> low<00:03:59.250> there's

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
to us like they're really low there's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.270 
to us like they're really low there's
the<00:04:00.120> HDMI<00:04:00.599> control<00:04:01.079> for<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.379> ps3<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.129> can

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
the HDMI control for the ps3 so it can

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.960 
the HDMI control for the ps3 so it can
control<00:04:02.669> stuff<00:04:02.970> on<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:04.579> it'll<00:04:05.579> tell<00:04:05.849> you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
control stuff on it and it'll tell you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.119 
control stuff on it and it'll tell you
the<00:04:06.000> signal<00:04:06.449> information<00:04:06.599> there's<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> quick

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
the signal information there's a quick

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.860 
the signal information there's a quick
start<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.699> it<00:04:08.819> which<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.150> should<00:04:09.329> just<00:04:09.659> turn

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
start to it which you should just turn

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.890 
start to it which you should just turn
on<00:04:10.099> otherwise<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.519> moves<00:04:12.060> really<00:04:12.359> slow<00:04:12.659> I

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
on otherwise it just moves really slow I

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.849 
on otherwise it just moves really slow I
think<00:04:13.139> was<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.319> design<00:04:13.709> for<00:04:13.919> that<00:04:15.709> change<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
think was the design for that change the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.810 
think was the design for that change the
language

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.490 

it's<00:04:20.540> really<00:04:20.720> hard<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.020> figure<00:04:21.140> out<00:04:21.320> these

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
it's really hard to figure out these

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.180 
it's really hard to figure out these
controls<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.970> 3d<00:04:23.570> you'll<00:04:23.960> actually<00:04:24.290> there's

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
controls the 3d you'll actually there's

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.770 
controls the 3d you'll actually there's
a<00:04:25.250> button<00:04:25.520> for<00:04:25.730> 3d<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.150> monitor<00:04:26.540> or<00:04:26.690> you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
a button for 3d on the monitor or you

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
a button for 3d on the monitor or you
can<00:04:26.870> go<00:04:26.960> into<00:04:27.110> here<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:27.440> I'll<00:04:28.280> show<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.490> hold

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
can go into here but I'll show you hold

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.930 
can go into here but I'll show you hold
