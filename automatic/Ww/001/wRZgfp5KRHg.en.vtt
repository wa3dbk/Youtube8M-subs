00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 trooper is very easy to use means 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.030
 has a few buttons here has two 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:21.180
 operating mode on the screen is good 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:24.960
 you can see all the metals of discrimination so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.460
 the most important difference between this model 356 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.849
 that when the device has 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.820
 99 segments of water rocks and what is 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.570
 scale the water that is here we are now 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.379
 priborchik turn and you will see that is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.449
 this part of the device displays the numbers 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:51.769
 that correspond to one type or another 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.360
 metal that is here let's say if you 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.570
 brews and es 350 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.899
 type of metal is displayed here cubes 12 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.750
 pieces 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.079
 here, too, rice cubes 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.490
 less but there is more 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:12.229
 the conduction numbers are displayed well in 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 in short, the numbers of water is a type of metal 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.649
 roughly speaking the conductivity of the metal then 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.440
 there is let's say that's 5 kopecks of the USSR 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.360
 It has 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.500
 give me a paw for some sleep i don't know 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.940
 admissible we drive her numbers there in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 district 76 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:40.200
 then take the copper coin is the shelf at 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:42.480
 we do not have number 87 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.740
 this is a highly more conductive goal 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.040
 polushka and numbers are indicators of water from them 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.500
 also we have on the screen 5 segment 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:02.160
 scale of depth of fire 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 she 4 secret also the device has 3 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.520
 tonal sound index intensification 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.360
 go type targets let's say copper silver 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.150
 sounds high too 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.270
 brass sounds average tone well and iron 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.270
 and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.010
 iron will 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.640
 the interesting will seem to ring 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.970
 according to the number of water iron more 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.459
 low so rock is traditionally water and 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.099
 stretched on the iron range that is 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.379
 tsvetmet start from 40 and above for what 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.109
 it's made why so many numbers by 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.500
 factory price because many small 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.920
 targets such as bronze tip 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.720
 Here is such a small cross and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.040
 such 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.659
 can give either a golden chain can 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.590
 give testimony cleaned out in the area 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.889
 35 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.620
 that already corresponds to the iron's 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.480
 You could not miss such a goal as 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.989
 let 's say down the river where it's iron 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.780
 two three dice allocated for this 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.480
 range a little stretch meaning you 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.700
 can easily made a decision for yourself 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.319
 diggers dig that goal you share 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.090
 iron is a useful goal so further that we 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:42.739
 Do not miss any more time talking about on here 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.519
 newt I have said iron is low 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.620
 other metals have an average tone 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.680
 silver tall shouts has only 2 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.919
 tonal dubbing have silver bolton 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:04.379
 all the rest one tone is not important iron 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:06.629
 it's either hundreds of the world considered little important 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.879
 voice element is an overload if 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.449
 close coil is permissible 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.489
 big thing here for example this 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:18.750
 can leave the device 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.959
 makes an overload sound that's how it is for 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.639
 what is it like for example if you 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.220
 hold the coil over into the canning 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.860
 bank bank sent immediately hear 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.050
 overload if let's say you are looking for 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.060
 War and you under the coil small 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.820
 fragments overload there and if something 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.900
 the interesting will allow bayonets right away 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.889
 sounds to you loyalty devices out of 350 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.760
 250 there is no such function, but I think it is very 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:57.930
 need further also the device has 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.409
 volume control here at garrett ace 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.169
 350 volume control is not also 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:09.360
 the device has two inputs for connection 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:12.300
 headphones for 6 inch six 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.090
 mm connector and 3 soldered 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.950
 millimeter that is possible to connect 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.700
 any headphones including from the phone 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.789
 do not have to buy some expensive 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.789
 detector we
