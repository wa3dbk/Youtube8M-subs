okay<00:01:36.190> well<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:38.140> agree<00:01:38.290> with<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.500> I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
okay well I don't agree with that I

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.080 
okay well I don't agree with that I
think<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:38.890> through<00:01:39.010> there<00:01:39.130> but<00:01:39.310> if<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.910> is

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
think it's through there but if that is

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.370 
think it's through there but if that is
the<00:01:40.120> reason<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.570> still<00:01:40.900> won't<00:01:41.020> be<00:01:41.230> able<00:01:41.290> to

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
the reason you still won't be able to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620 
the reason you still won't be able to
see<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.560> cops<00:01:41.740> coming<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:43.120> if<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.360> biker
