really<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.840> usually<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.770> half<00:00:53.039> he

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
really good usually when we make half he

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
really good usually when we make half he
cuts<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.210> triangles<00:00:54.420> you'll<00:00:54.719> see

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cuts it into two triangles you'll see

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.580 
cuts it into two triangles you'll see
and<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:56.100> rarely<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.270> eat<00:00:57.390> both<00:00:57.750> triangles<00:00:58.230> ever

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and I rarely can eat both triangles ever

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.830 
and I rarely can eat both triangles ever
so<00:00:59.100> i<00:00:59.129> always<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.850> leftovers<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> next<00:01:00.539> day

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so i always get leftovers the next day

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
so i always get leftovers the next day
so<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> leftover<00:01:01.829> leftover<00:01:02.370> bonus
