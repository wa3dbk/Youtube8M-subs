00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Welcome to the new series that I 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.290

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.540
 even a delicious recipe for 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:20.189
 cod meatballs which may also be 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:22.890
 become a main course the advantage of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.920
 people having a delicious sauce ready as 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.320
 the one that takes lemon Sicilian olive oil and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
 basil we have time to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 develop and create new recipes as 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 this one that I replace the meat 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 usually used to make meatballs 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 and I made a song of cod and this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 recipe can do with chips 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 cod and therefore an excellent cost 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 benefit 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.360
 the recipe thus begins 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 well salted cod we go 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 mix coriander and parsley a pinch 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 of cumin that will give a little taste all 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.809
 special a little garlic onion well 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.420
 minced breadcrumbs and stale bread 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.780
 crusts removed only crumb of bread and now 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.110
 people put two whole eggs 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.110
 lightly beaten 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.340
 I really like this recipe. 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.640
 to serve as an aperitif when 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.580
 friends arrive at digging a beer one 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.479
 cold white wine will now have 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.479
 put your hand in the dough 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.009
 almost in the right place and as a dish 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.280
 main I like to be watch with rice 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.720
 white with parsley and with an egg 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.180
 chopped chopped 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.470
 now I'll make the balls this one 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.440
 recipe that is in the video description 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.270
 You can prepare 30 montigny in this 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.799
 size that serves both to make a 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.439
 main dish where we can 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.850
 put 61 little worlds like 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.820
 individually 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.830
 we make a delicious appetizer that the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.080
 people calculate about three per person 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.550
 When do we have a cocktail party? 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.229
 People are going to receive at home. 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.759

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.819

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.090
 Fire well soft here with a little bit 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.269
 of olive oil from the combination 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.470
 Codfish combines a lot but combines even 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.540
 It's with my eye that it 's personal I have 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.000
 a sauce to call from my orchard her 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 headed developed a glass marola eu 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.650
 I loved the freshness of the Sicilian lemon 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.829
 in this recipe this cookie has a name 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.650
 also chic in the Middle East if 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.489

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.380
 I want to do a chic like this 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.560
 change the name of the meatballs by the glass 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.600
 cod dumpling is the eye on the fish and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.970
 another on the cat and I'll keep an eye on 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.970
