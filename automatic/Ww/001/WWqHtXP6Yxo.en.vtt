00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
tape and just kind of figure out where

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.690 
tape and just kind of figure out where
it's<00:03:23.620> going<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.799> go<00:03:23.859> on<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.130> bottom<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.670> that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
it's going to go on the bottom so that

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.449 
it's going to go on the bottom so that
even<00:03:25.120> at<00:03:25.209> all<00:03:25.769> it's<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:26.980> kind<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.280> weird

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
even at all it's going to kind of weird

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.559 
even at all it's going to kind of weird
could<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.850> close<00:03:28.000> your<00:03:28.150> eye<00:03:28.269> like

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
could you close your eye like

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.030 
could you close your eye like
everything's<00:03:28.989> going<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> shift<00:03:29.440> but<00:03:29.739> as<00:03:29.859> long

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
everything's going to shift but as long

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.710 
everything's going to shift but as long
as<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.250> looks<00:03:30.400> somewhat<00:03:30.819> even<00:03:31.180> but<00:03:31.480> that's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
as it looks somewhat even but that's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
as it looks somewhat even but that's
okay<00:03:31.959> doesn't<00:03:32.319> have<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.620> perfect<00:03:33.010> because

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
okay doesn't have to be perfect because

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.690 
okay doesn't have to be perfect because
nothing<00:03:33.850> has<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.269> perfect

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.689 

and<00:04:33.580> then<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.660> go<00:04:34.930> into<00:04:38.190> into<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.310> eye<00:04:39.340> light

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
and then just go into into the eye light

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:47.970 
and then just go into into the eye light
and<00:04:39.970> then<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.360> gonna<00:04:40.630> press<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:40.960> on<00:04:41.199> top

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.560 

and<00:04:48.520> then<00:04:48.640> when<00:04:48.730> you<00:04:48.820> get<00:04:48.970> right<00:04:49.120> down<00:04:49.180> to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
and then when you get right down to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.860 
and then when you get right down to
where<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.810> sort<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.170> fades<00:04:50.440> out<00:04:51.510> I'm<00:04:52.510> just<00:04:52.630> kind

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
where it sort of fades out I'm just kind

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.860 
where it sort of fades out I'm just kind
of<00:04:52.930> brush<00:04:53.200> it

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.600 

so<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.560> looks<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.040> glitter<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.370> kind<00:04:58.550> of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
so it looks like the glitter is kind of

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.850 
so it looks like the glitter is kind of
fading<00:04:58.880> too<00:04:59.090> um<00:04:59.750> yeah<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:00.320> don't<00:05:00.470> know<00:05:00.620> how<00:05:00.770> much
