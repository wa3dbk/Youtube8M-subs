00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.669
 I find parliament and you can't 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.560
 Yup 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.990
 and so 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710
 yes no 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.080
 but who looks 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.030
 is by divided action 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.710
 instead of zero a passenger compartment 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.340
 3 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.000
 Now 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.660
 for her 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.569
 zero 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.290
 thank you 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.270
 the future 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.760
 it's not true 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 but if we see then this team 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.910
 we say that he also knows how to suffer because one 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.530
 day we say absurd with seven between 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.300
 poles and crossbar in other words be able to 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.000
 recovering was not easy 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.090
 yes well it wasn't easy under the plan 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.970
 psychological that yes why not 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 surely we did not expect one 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.440
 greece so we say in the first two 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.930
 times 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.410
 they were lucky enough for us 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.240
 we are not and different poles and crosspieces there 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.910
 prevented from going to the mark 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.500
 obviously pre in the long run they took 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.210
 courage and 23 pitches entered 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.760
 so they went to have gone 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.380
 but forward in the last time and I have it 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.010
 said right at the beginning of the three boys 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.050
 they had the chance to overturn the 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.470
 result and in fact in part was 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.110
 so if they believed a little more in the 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.360
 last seconds even managed to 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.610
 do the 4 to 3 but I mean okay 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.190
 however, today we have tried everything 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.380
 the recovery the extra rigor but 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.060
 then in the end the goal was born well 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.800
 minimum minimum, that is the minimum 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.940
 the company has been reached to beat 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.320
 the england yes well I repeat to 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.160
 guys I said and you have to win six 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.590
 then leave as they arrive 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.360
 victories the important thing is to win today is 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.480
 the second victory even though it arrived 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.690
 on penalties and tomorrow there is another is at 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.500
 beyond the passage of the shift 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:33.560
 we must still win and bring 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.890
 forward those that are what it is 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.630
 the positive venue of the matches 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.880
 simone del mestre as we said before 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.550
 as the technician today we have done 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.530
 all that is the recovery of the additional i 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.250
 rigors and then you came to be a hero 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.310
 of the day 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.919
 well it is clear that rigors a lottery e 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.530
 if the paris wins, then they have been 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:58.220
 good others to score from 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:01.010
 surely the third were good 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.780
 time to stay on the piece for anyway 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.060
 under 2 0 below two goals 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.530
 it was not easy to have recovered is not 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.200
 been paid to very good to not 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.690
 take nothing to concede 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.580
 Unfortunately, they have managed to goal 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.229
 in the three times to go and get us 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.810
 three same points applies to i 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:19.550
 additional cross piles are wasted 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.979
 let's say you were very lucky and then 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.010
 the penalties went well it was a 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.870
 second surreal time yes from 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.700
 maybe we had a small drop of 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.710
 tension we did not expect a greece 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.130
 that it held up so well physically i 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.750
 first two times were defended 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.990
 very neatly they always closed 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.840
 in the central area 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.310
 we know the improbability of sand yes 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.470
 is turned a little bad but if you are good from 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.330
 today there was finally even the 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.840
 public thrust nice to play with it 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.650
 full stage 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.400
 yes absolutely definitely gives us one 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.920
 big hand 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.450
 the important thing is that they continue to come to 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.020
 fill the stage that we have 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.330
 really need 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.150
 discounted rhetoric question pad business 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.230
 where can this Italy arrive tomorrow 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.640
 tomorrow we have to win depends on us 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.700
 because I have to go to close the round in 

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.700
 head
