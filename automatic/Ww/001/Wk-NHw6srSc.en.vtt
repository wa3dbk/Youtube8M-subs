our second tester was able to go more
left<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.630> right<00:02:08.869> due<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.200> his<00:02:09.320> higher<00:02:09.500> reverie

left to right due to his higher reverie

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.430 
left to right due to his higher reverie
he<00:02:10.850> saw<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> strong<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:11.750> very<00:02:11.930> controllable

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
he saw a strong but very controllable

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.470 
he saw a strong but very controllable
ball<00:02:12.740> motion<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.370> continued<00:02:13.880> really<00:02:14.180> strong

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
ball motion that continued really strong

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:46.150 
ball motion that continued really strong
through<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.780> pins

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400 

the<00:02:50.459> OMG<00:02:50.940> Pearl<00:02:51.209> gives<00:02:51.599> him<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.080> angular

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the OMG Pearl gives him a more angular

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.740 
the OMG Pearl gives him a more angular
reaction<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.430> overall<00:02:53.730> slightly<00:02:54.180> weaker

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
reaction but overall slightly weaker

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320 
reaction but overall slightly weaker
than<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.050> Black<00:02:55.260> Mamba<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.610> Mamba<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.030> very

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
than the Black Mamba the Mamba is very

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.750 
than the Black Mamba the Mamba is very
complementary<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.349> OMG<00:02:58.890> pearls<00:02:59.250> reaction

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
complementary to the OMG pearls reaction

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.699 
complementary to the OMG pearls reaction
giving<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> slightly<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:01.080> overall<00:03:01.380> hook

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
giving you slightly more overall hook

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:36.150 
giving you slightly more overall hook
but<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.130> much<00:03:02.400> smoother<00:03:02.970> overall<00:03:03.000> motion
