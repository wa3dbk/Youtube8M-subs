side-by-side as you can see the height
is<00:02:10.479> about<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.840> same

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is about the same

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
is about the same
yes<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:14.320> thickness<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:15.010> around<00:02:15.720> double<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
yes the thickness is around double the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.270 
yes the thickness is around double the
size<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.440> Samsung<00:02:17.830> Galaxy<00:02:17.860> s2<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:21.130> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
size of the Samsung Galaxy s2 this is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920 
size of the Samsung Galaxy s2 this is
roughly<00:02:21.700> give<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> picture<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.450> how<00:02:22.630> large

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
roughly give you a picture of how large

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
roughly give you a picture of how large
will<00:02:23.110> be<00:02:28.110> right<00:02:30.180> over<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:31.860> at<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
will be right over here at the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.810 
will be right over here at the
transformer<00:02:33.490> here<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.350> press<00:02:35.530> once<00:02:35.890> you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
transformer here if you press once you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.640 
transformer here if you press once you
can<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.360> power<00:02:37.660> level<00:02:38.160> yeah<00:02:39.160> five<00:02:40.650> level

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
can see the power level yeah five level

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.230 
can see the power level yeah five level
all<00:02:41.800> here

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
all here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.050 
all here
my<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:43.300> left<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:43.870> each<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.980> LED<00:02:45.850> light

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
my is left for each of the LED light

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.130 
my is left for each of the LED light
here<00:02:46.300> will<00:02:46.570> represent<00:02:46.750> 20%<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.800> battery

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
here will represent 20% of the battery

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.020 
here will represent 20% of the battery
so<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.680> means<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:51.310> less<00:02:51.520> than<00:02:51.550> 20

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so this means that I have less than 20

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.490 
so this means that I have less than 20
