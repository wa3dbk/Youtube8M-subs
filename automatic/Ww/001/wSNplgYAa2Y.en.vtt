00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
her spine between the two bones stick

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
her spine between the two bones stick

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.250 
against the other side of her shoulder
blade<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.830> attended<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> Dora<00:00:23.580> by<00:00:24.199> doing<00:00:25.199> an

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
blade so we attended to Dora by doing an

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.689 
blade so we attended to Dora by doing an
ultrasound<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.099> heard<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.430> she<00:00:26.490> was

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
ultrasound because we heard that she was

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
ultrasound because we heard that she was
pregnant<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.930> determined<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pregnant and so we determined that that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.109 
pregnant and so we determined that that
little<00:00:28.830> fetuses<00:00:29.279> were<00:00:29.400> still<00:00:29.609> beating<00:00:29.820> away

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
little fetuses were still beating away

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
little fetuses were still beating away
and<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:30.869> very<00:00:31.170> excited<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.859> lots<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> hands

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and I'm very excited and lots of hands

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.830 
and I'm very excited and lots of hands
up<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.759> air<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.210> everything<00:00:33.390> else<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
up in the air and everything else and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.139 
up in the air and everything else and
then<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.559> did<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.860> x-rays<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.820> exactly

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
then we did some x-rays to see exactly

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.900 
then we did some x-rays to see exactly
where<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> arrow<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> from<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.700> we

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
where the arrow was and from there we

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.979 
where the arrow was and from there we
were<00:00:39.000> able<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> determine<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> arrow

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
were able to determine that the arrow

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.690 
were able to determine that the arrow
hadn't<00:00:40.379> punctured<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:40.920> her<00:00:41.010> lungs<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the top of her spine and we decided to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
the top of her spine and we decided to
