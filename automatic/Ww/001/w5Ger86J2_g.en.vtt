to<00:04:01.880> full<00:04:02.060> what<00:04:02.630> happens<00:04:03.019> is<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:04.459> will<00:04:05.090> increase

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
to full what happens is it will increase

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.140 
to full what happens is it will increase
the<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.620> will<00:04:06.739> give<00:04:06.920> players<00:04:07.190> within<00:04:07.609> 10<00:04:07.970> yards

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
the it will give players within 10 yards

the it will give players within 10 yards
twenty-five<00:04:09.019> percent<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.410> their<00:04:09.500> amount<00:04:09.620> of

twenty-five percent of their amount of
back<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.190> increase<00:04:10.940> their<00:04:11.180> healing<00:04:11.420> done<00:04:11.750> by

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
back and increase their healing done by

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.629 
back and increase their healing done by
75%<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.130> also<00:04:13.400> stacks<00:04:13.760> now<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.540> don't<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:15.139> if

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
75% it also stacks now I don't know if

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.340 
75% it also stacks now I don't know if
again<00:04:16.639> like<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.180> other<00:04:17.269> one<00:04:17.450> if<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:18.049> is

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
again like the other one if this is

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.210 
again like the other one if this is
increased<00:04:18.769> healing<00:04:19.159> done

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
increased healing done

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.850 
increased healing done
and<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:21.660> how<00:04:21.840> long<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.290> lasts<00:04:22.530> for

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
and like how long this lasts for

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.340 
and like how long this lasts for
anything<00:04:23.220> about<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.790> buff<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.660> we'll<00:04:24.930> have<00:04:25.110> to

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
anything about the buff so we'll have to

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.860 
anything about the buff so we'll have to
probably<00:04:26.010> hear<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.340> C<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.730> game<00:04:26.970> what<00:04:27.660> that's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
probably hear of C in game what that's

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.870 
probably hear of C in game what that's
like<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.230> terms<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.590> curation<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.580> next

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
like in terms of curation so the next

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.640 
like in terms of curation so the next
vote<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.240> called<00:04:30.450> erupting<00:04:30.900> Shannon<00:04:31.410> what<00:04:31.530> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
vote is called erupting Shannon what it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.490 
vote is called erupting Shannon what it
does<00:04:31.890> is<00:04:32.190> when<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.150> puddle<00:04:33.540> reaches<00:04:34.080> immerseus

these<00:04:58.350> stacks<00:04:58.710> will<00:04:59.430> cause<00:04:59.760> damage<00:05:00.330> to

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
these stacks will cause damage to

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.440 
these stacks will cause damage to
increase<00:05:00.930> rapidly<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.060> seems<00:05:03.150> like<00:05:03.360> the

one<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.460> these<00:05:08.610> pills<00:05:08.880> causes<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> tube

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
one of these pills causes a tube

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.810 
one of these pills causes a tube
decrease<00:05:09.960> in<00:05:10.110> size<00:05:10.290> I'm<00:05:10.590> letting<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.550> puddle

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
decrease in size I'm letting a puddle

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.520 
decrease in size I'm letting a puddle
move<00:05:11.970> over<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.360> will<00:05:12.480> make<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.810> get<00:05:12.930> bigger<00:05:13.200> so

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
move over it will make it get bigger so

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.560 
move over it will make it get bigger so
essentially<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.580> just<00:05:14.790> managing<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> size

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
essentially it's just managing the size

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.940 
essentially it's just managing the size
of<00:05:15.780> these<00:05:15.900> pills<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:17.250> think<00:05:17.490> if<00:05:17.910> anyone<00:05:18.330> is

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
of these pills and I think if anyone is

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.350 
of these pills and I think if anyone is
remembers<00:05:19.950> that<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.250> can<00:05:20.490> fight<00:05:20.790> when

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
remembers that you can fight when

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.970 
remembers that you can fight when
sometimes<00:05:21.600> you'll<00:05:21.930> have<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.230> stand<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.800> the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
sometimes you'll have to stand in the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.250 
sometimes you'll have to stand in the
puddles<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.640> make<00:05:23.790> them<00:05:24.000> disappear<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.840> think

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
puddles to make them disappear I think

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.720 
puddles to make them disappear I think
will<00:05:25.380> be<00:05:25.470> similar<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.890> that<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.190> course<00:05:26.430> will

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
will be similar to that of course will

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.430 
will be similar to that of course will
make<00:05:26.880> them<00:05:27.000> disappear<00:05:27.150> but<00:05:27.750> that's<00:05:28.050> roughly

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
make them disappear but that's roughly

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.800 
make them disappear but that's roughly
how<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.650> think<00:05:28.890> it<00:05:29.010> works<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:30.060> that's<00:05:30.390> pretty

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
how I think it works so that's pretty

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.320 
how I think it works so that's pretty
much<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.110> Fighting's<00:05:31.830> sort<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.550> two<00:05:32.850> faced<00:05:33.060> by

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
much the Fighting's sort of two faced by

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.670 
much the Fighting's sort of two faced by
it<00:05:33.390> seems<00:05:33.660> like<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.930> lasts<00:05:34.110> those<00:05:34.260> two<00:05:34.470> faces

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
it seems like it lasts those two faces

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.710 
it seems like it lasts those two faces
until<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.190> end<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.520> fight<00:05:35.760> both<00:05:36.450> phases

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
until the end of the fight both phases

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.230 
until the end of the fight both phases
seem<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.290> be<00:05:37.410> relatively<00:05:37.740> interesting<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.640> it

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
seem to be relatively interesting and it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.270 
seem to be relatively interesting and it
does<00:05:39.479> look<00:05:39.690> quite<00:05:40.110> varied<00:05:40.590> I'd<00:05:40.740> be<00:05:40.919> worried

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
does look quite varied I'd be worried

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.700 
does look quite varied I'd be worried
that<00:05:41.310> perhaps<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:42.690> fight<00:05:42.960> would<00:05:43.169> last<00:05:43.229> too

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
that perhaps the fight would last too

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.469 
that perhaps the fight would last too
many<00:05:43.890> phases<00:05:44.160> which<00:05:44.729> would<00:05:44.880> make<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.060> kind<00:05:45.419> of

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
many phases which would make it kind of

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.180 
many phases which would make it kind of
boring<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.990> think<00:05:46.530> this<00:05:46.620> fight<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:46.919> probably

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
boring I think this fight is probably

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.430 
boring I think this fight is probably
best<00:05:47.400> if<00:05:47.669> you<00:05:47.820> do<00:05:47.940> each<00:05:48.120> face<00:05:48.390> once<00:05:48.690> sorry<00:05:49.320> not

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
best if you do each face once sorry not

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.490 
best if you do each face once sorry not
once<00:05:49.680> twice<00:05:50.090> but<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.540> does<00:05:51.930> seem<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.260> be<00:05:52.320> rather

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
once twice but it does seem to be rather

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500 
once twice but it does seem to be rather
interesting<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:53.610> boss<00:05:53.820> himself<00:05:53.970> looks

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
interesting the boss himself looks

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.570 
interesting the boss himself looks
pretty<00:05:54.810> cool<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.770> know<00:05:55.830> with<00:05:56.070> pretty<00:05:56.400> down

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
pretty cool you know with pretty down

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.730 
pretty cool you know with pretty down
massive<00:05:57.090> so<00:05:57.240> I<00:05:57.270> think<00:05:57.780> yeah<00:05:57.960> this<00:05:58.320> is<00:05:58.500> probably

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
massive so I think yeah this is probably

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.040 
massive so I think yeah this is probably
a<00:05:58.890> simple<00:05:59.400> boss<00:05:59.580> for<00:05:59.850> the<00:06:00.000> raid<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.360> I<00:06:00.840> really

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
a simple boss for the raid and I really

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.450 
a simple boss for the raid and I really
look<00:06:01.169> forward<00:06:01.229> to<00:06:01.530> after<00:06:01.890> trying<00:06:02.250> out<00:06:02.430> for

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
look forward to after trying out for

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.850 
look forward to after trying out for
myself<00:06:02.880> if<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.390> get<00:06:03.600> into<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:03.990> PTR<00:06:04.500> which<00:06:04.680> I

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
myself if I get into the PTR which I

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.620 
myself if I get into the PTR which I
very<00:06:04.890> much<00:06:05.160> doubt<00:06:05.520> of<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:05.820> stage<00:06:06.060> thanks

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
very much doubt of this stage thanks

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.280 
very much doubt of this stage thanks
blizzard<00:06:06.930> then<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:08.010> will<00:06:08.750> help<00:06:09.750> bring<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.050> kill

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
blizzard then I will help bring you kill

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.520 
blizzard then I will help bring you kill
video<00:06:10.590> but<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.810> way<00:06:12.810> things<00:06:12.870> are<00:06:13.290> I<00:06:13.320> think

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
video but the way things are I think

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.409 
video but the way things are I think
these<00:06:13.710> sort<00:06:14.220> of<00:06:14.280> extended<00:06:14.729> previews<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.330> we

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
these sort of extended previews and we

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.880 
these sort of extended previews and we
just<00:06:15.630> having<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.900> chat<00:06:16.080> about<00:06:16.290> what<00:06:16.470> I<00:06:16.500> think

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
just having a chat about what I think

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.830 
just having a chat about what I think
are<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.550> best<00:06:17.700> thing<00:06:17.970> if<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:18.450> want<00:06:18.630> to<00:06:18.720> watch

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
are the best thing if you want to watch

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.110 
are the best thing if you want to watch
the<00:06:19.050> full<00:06:19.320> video<00:06:19.530> about<00:06:20.250> this<00:06:20.460> boss<00:06:20.760> then<00:06:21.030> I'd

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
the full video about this boss then I'd

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.940 
the full video about this boss then I'd
recommend<00:06:21.510> checking<00:06:21.930> out<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.320> icy<00:06:22.740> veins

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
recommend checking out the icy veins

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.100 
recommend checking out the icy veins
kill<00:06:23.850> video<00:06:24.180> it's<00:06:24.390> only<00:06:24.570> about<00:06:24.660> two<00:06:24.930> minutes

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
kill video it's only about two minutes

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.600 
kill video it's only about two minutes
long<00:06:25.410> so<00:06:25.440> probably<00:06:25.950> won't<00:06:26.100> get<00:06:26.220> as<00:06:26.400> much

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
long so probably won't get as much

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.490 
long so probably won't get as much
detailed<00:06:27.150> information<00:06:27.450> but<00:06:28.229> you<00:06:28.349> will

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
detailed information but you will

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.230 
detailed information but you will
actually<00:06:28.680> get<00:06:28.919> to<00:06:28.979> see<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> fight<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:29.789> action

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
actually get to see the fight in action

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.490 
actually get to see the fight in action
as<00:06:30.390> opposed<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.720> what<00:06:30.750> I've<00:06:30.960> been<00:06:31.050> able<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.380> do

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
as opposed to what I've been able to do

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.440 
as opposed to what I've been able to do
so<00:06:32.130> that's<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.520> for<00:06:32.580> now<00:06:32.820> thank<00:06:33.210> you<00:06:33.330> for

so that's it for now thank you for

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.210 
so that's it for now thank you for
watching<00:06:33.599> and<00:06:34.050> I<00:06:34.200> will<00:06:34.229> see<00:06:34.470> you<00:06:34.770> next<00:06:34.950> time
