think<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.090> 18<00:01:12.270> hours<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> feeding

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
think it's 18 hours have a feeding

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
think it's 18 hours have a feeding
period<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.610> 6<00:01:14.880> hours<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.170> that's<00:01:16.619> six

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
period of 6 hours and so that's six

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
period of 6 hours and so that's six
hours<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.460> me<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.790> probably<00:01:17.880> gonna<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.240> like
