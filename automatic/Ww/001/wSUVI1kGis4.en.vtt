00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.669 
oily um usually like after like two days
it's<00:01:46.460> oily<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:47.479> two<00:01:47.750> days<00:01:47.899> it's<00:01:48.259> pretty<00:01:48.439> good

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
it's oily but two days it's pretty good

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.380 
it's oily but two days it's pretty good
you<00:01:48.979> know<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:49.460> without<00:01:50.030> using

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
you know and that's without using

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.719 
you know and that's without using
sulfate<00:01:50.780> free<00:01:50.990> shampoo<00:01:51.469> so<00:01:52.130> if<00:01:52.219> I<00:01:52.310> were<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.700> use

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
sulfate free shampoo so if I were to use

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.309 
sulfate free shampoo so if I were to use
sulfate<00:01:53.210> free<00:01:53.359> shampoo<00:01:53.719> it'd<00:01:53.899> probably<00:01:54.079> be

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
sulfate free shampoo it'd probably be

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.840 
sulfate free shampoo it'd probably be
non-oil<00:01:54.859> for<00:01:55.039> like<00:01:55.159> three<00:01:55.399> or<00:01:55.490> four<00:01:55.520> days

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
non-oil for like three or four days

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.279 
non-oil for like three or four days
which<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.299> pretty<00:01:56.780> awesome

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289
