we<00:03:24.360> thought<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.049> girls<00:03:25.230> were<00:03:25.379> is<00:03:25.500> very

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
we thought that the girls were is very

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.099 
we thought that the girls were is very
pretty<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.819> some<00:03:26.969> lovely<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.719> prints

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
pretty and with some lovely and prints

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.929 
pretty and with some lovely and prints
and<00:03:28.439> it<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:28.829> nicely<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.340> oranges<00:03:29.790> and

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
and it was really nicely the oranges and

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.550 
and it was really nicely the oranges and
the<00:03:29.969> leaf<00:03:30.180> pattern<00:03:30.569> is<00:03:30.659> coming<00:03:30.930> through

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.839 

I<00:03:35.620> thought<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.580> really<00:03:36.610> interesting

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
I thought it was a really interesting

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.180 
I thought it was a really interesting
show<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:38.050> always<00:03:38.230> good<00:03:38.560> at<00:03:38.830> law<00:03:38.950> actually

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
show it's always good at law actually

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.400 
show it's always good at law actually
but<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.610> think<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:39.880> year<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.930> huge

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
but I think this year is that is a huge

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.940 
but I think this year is that is a huge
leap<00:03:41.650> forward<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:42.400> congratulations
