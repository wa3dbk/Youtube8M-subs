00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.249
 We have already seen neither for speed rail valls 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.410
 we have seen or battlefield 4 plays see 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:11.230
 now the call of duty coast in its 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.630
 version for xbox one a version that the 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.390
 truth is that at the beginning it was criticized 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.680
 that's why it did not reach 1080p or 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.360
 at least they had not wanted the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.390
 reach but now it's being 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.430
 venerated even in some aspects it 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.560
 is treating the version of 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.199
 xbox one than the playstation 4 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.240
 because well then let's see images and 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 simply to deduct it for us 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.690
 same 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.390
 we have already spoken on numerous occasions 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.820
 how it looks Call of Duty Coast 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.500
 the different consoles we talked about 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.360
 the playstation 4 version of the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.550
 present generation of the pc version 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.320
 but attentive because now we go with the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 version of xbox one you know that the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.579
 console is already in stores and cloud 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.530
 useful causes is one of the titles that 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.200
 more are acquiring for this console 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.300
 microsoft nextgen one of its first 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 launch titles is the game of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.730
 activision that arrives weeks after 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.890
 the versions of xbox 360 playstation3 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.770
 with that same argument of course 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.950
 a us that are at war against a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.530
 federation of countries of south america 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.510
 fighting for every inch of ground from 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 then an epic battle you're going to 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.580
 find in that call of duty coast and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.320
 certainly impressive the quality 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.020
 graphic that has been shown in the version 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 of xbox one the first minutes of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 game have been shown in several 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 videos a lot of users enjoy a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 and again from this version of xbox one 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.620
 of call of duty coast and good to the end and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.110
 after all, it is you who have a 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.630
 Very nice view to decide which of 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.580
 all versions looks better than such 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.980
 you see this title in xbox one 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.970
 remember that the game runs at 60 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.710
 frames per second approximately and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.480
 720p resolution something that has been 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.730
 quite conflictive in terms of 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.860
 information since we remember that the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.630
 version of playstation 4 enjoys a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.909
 higher resolution 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.460
 xbox one but yes it is true that 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.739
 have found certain failures in the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.250
 playstation 4 version in terms of 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.430
 jerks and slowdown is due to those 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.769
 1080p softened something strange that are 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 doing to achieve 1080p in call 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.190
 of duty goes in any case does not 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.140
 we are going to ask for pears in the oven because 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.360
 we are facing one of the first titles 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.430
 and a title that unfortunately has been 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.239
 done quite quickly its conversion 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.239
 for the next-gen
