00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and the sony xperia z2 now you've

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.200 
and the sony xperia z2 now you've
crossed<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.400> difference<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.029> it's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
crossed the difference of that it's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
crossed the difference of that it's
actually<00:00:18.420> almost<00:00:18.750> bright<00:00:19.140> displays<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> new

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
actually almost bright displays the new

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.740 
actually almost bright displays the new
collection<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.340> three<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:21.600> pull

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
collection or three but we actually pull

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.870 
collection or three but we actually pull
it<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:21.930> as<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.529> can<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.800> there<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.640> still

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it up as you can see there it's still

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
it up as you can see there it's still
not<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> very<00:00:24.269> very<00:00:24.449> bright<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> it's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
not a very very bright now it is it's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
not a very very bright now it is it's
full<00:00:25.529> brightness<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.420> sooo<00:00:27.779> much

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
full brightness so it's just sooo much

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
full brightness so it's just sooo much
bright<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.590> reason<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.010> she<00:00:29.070> got

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
bright but for some reason it so she got

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250 
bright but for some reason it so she got
really<00:00:29.460> good<00:00:29.640> blacks<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
really good blacks so I think the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
really good blacks so I think the
drawback<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.520> bright<00:00:32.700> as

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
drawback is that it's not as bright as

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
drawback is that it's not as bright as
been<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> past<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.350> very

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
been in the past but you got some very

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
been in the past but you got some very
good<00:00:34.739> blog<00:00:35.010> details<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> good

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
good blog details which is a good

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
good blog details which is a good
trailer<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.020> opinion<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:37.860> need

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
trailer for my opinion you don't need

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
trailer for my opinion you don't need
the<00:00:38.190> bright<00:00:38.430> screen<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> world<00:00:39.059> especially

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the bright screen the world especially

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
the bright screen the world especially
in<00:00:39.540> England<00:00:39.840> where<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
in England where we don't get a lot of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
specifications they are very very

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180 
specifications they are very very
similar<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.200> Snapdragon<00:00:46.829> 800

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
similar we have got a Snapdragon 800

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
5.2 but the biggest thing is the phones

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
5.2 but the biggest thing is the phones
are<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:55.949> similar<00:00:56.129> size<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> are

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
are very very similar size so you are

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
buzzes all together anyway let's take

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.039 
buzzes all together anyway let's take
you<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> buff<00:01:15.180> devices<00:01:15.630> really

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you around the buff devices really

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
you around the buff devices really
quickly<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.799> i<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:16.920> picked<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.790> these

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
quickly so if i just picked off these

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.380 
quickly so if i just picked off these
ones<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.939> side<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.299> each

and<00:02:27.030> actually<00:02:27.390> sound<00:02:27.840> pretty<00:02:28.110> nice<00:02:28.380> they're

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and actually sound pretty nice they're

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.260 
and actually sound pretty nice they're
not<00:02:28.800> actually<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.220> bad<00:02:29.280> whereas<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
not actually that bad whereas on the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.940 
not actually that bad whereas on the
Samsung<00:02:30.840> age<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.650> neural<00:02:31.830> at<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
Samsung age is just a neural at the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.860 
Samsung age is just a neural at the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
bottom which to be fair it's not bad for

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.780 
bottom which to be fair it's not bad for
you<00:02:34.050> want<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.350> from<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> bottom<00:02:35.490> even

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you want it from one at the bottom even

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.460 
you want it from one at the bottom even
and<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> front<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.870> them<00:02:37.050> beef<00:02:37.200> both

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
and on the front of them beef both

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.110 
and on the front of them beef both
around<00:02:37.890> 2<00:02:38.070> megapixels<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> front-facing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
around 2 megapixels for the front-facing

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.790 
around 2 megapixels for the front-facing
camera<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> mean<00:02:40.410> they've<00:02:40.500> got<00:02:40.620> very

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
camera so I mean they've got very

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
camera so I mean they've got very
similar<00:02:41.070> feel<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.520> mean<00:02:41.670> they're<00:02:41.820> both<00:02:41.940> our

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
