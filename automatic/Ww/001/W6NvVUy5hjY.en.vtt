processing units these companies make

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.920 
processing units these companies make
are<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> incredibly<00:01:14.729> keen<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
are just so incredibly keen that it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
are just so incredibly keen that it
makes<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> simply<00:01:16.860> impossible<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.580> point<00:01:17.820> out

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
makes it simply impossible to point out

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.240 
makes it simply impossible to point out
that<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.450> perfect<00:01:19.140> graphics<00:01:19.680> card<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.159> your
