for<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.560> camera<00:01:39.040> obviously<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.630> we<00:01:40.780> may<00:01:41.409> want

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
for the camera obviously so we may want

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.750 
for the camera obviously so we may want
to<00:01:42.210> align<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.960> camera<00:01:44.200> itself<00:01:44.760> it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
to align it to the camera itself it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.120 
to align it to the camera itself it
doesn't<00:01:46.090> really<00:01:46.479> seem<00:01:46.840> too<00:01:47.260> hard<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.860> not

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
doesn't really seem too hard it's not

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.910 
doesn't really seem too hard it's not
like<00:01:51.400> installing<00:01:51.850> app<00:01:52.150> screen<00:01:52.840> shield<00:01:53.140> or<00:01:53.500> so

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
like installing app screen shield or so

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.260 
like installing app screen shield or so
that<00:01:54.310> it's<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:55.150> hard<00:01:55.750> at<00:01:56.020> least<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:56.590> me

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.160 

we<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.450> some<00:02:03.690> bubbles

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.280 

it's<00:02:11.170> not<00:02:11.469> installed<00:02:12.040> perfectly<00:02:12.879> because<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it's not installed perfectly because the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
it's not installed perfectly because the
iphone<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.709> curved<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.189> try<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> move

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
iphone is curved so we can try to move

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.039 
iphone is curved so we can try to move
the<00:02:22.659> bubbles<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.379> we<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.459> try<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:25.659> rid<00:02:26.019> of

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
the bubbles out we can try to get rid of

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:32.869 
the bubbles out we can try to get rid of
this<00:02:27.000> effect<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:30.069> an<00:02:30.280> easy<00:02:30.670> task<00:02:30.819> button

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
this effect it's not an easy task button

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.240 
this effect it's not an easy task button
and<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.450> back<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.170> say<00:02:35.409> that<00:02:35.439> it's<00:02:35.950> fully

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
and the back we can say that it's fully

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.869 
and the back we can say that it's fully
installed<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.879> can<00:02:36.909> see<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.389> it<00:02:37.720> gives<00:02:37.989> just

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
installed we can see that it gives just

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.449 
installed we can see that it gives just
it<00:02:39.879> puts<00:02:40.150> some<00:02:40.389> fun<00:02:40.689> on<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.170> iphone<00:02:41.530> okay<00:02:42.159> now

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
it puts some fun on the iphone okay now

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
it puts some fun on the iphone okay now
we<00:02:42.519> also<00:02:42.909> have<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.620> front<00:02:44.980> side<00:02:45.639> and<00:02:46.230> there's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
we also have the front side and there's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.839 
we also have the front side and there's
code<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.549> download<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:50.519> background<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:51.819> you

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
code to download the background so you

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.490 
code to download the background so you
can<00:02:52.150> perfectly<00:02:52.629> match<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:55.079> we<00:02:56.079> will<00:02:56.230> see

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
can perfectly match the back we will see

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.869 
can perfectly match the back we will see
later<00:02:56.709> I<00:03:01.439> think<00:03:02.439> that<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.889> part<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.549> going<00:03:03.760> to

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
later I think that this part is going to

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.360 
later I think that this part is going to
be<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.419> hard<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:04.750> install<00:03:05.169> because<00:03:05.379> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
be really hard to install because it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.270 
be really hard to install because it's
really<00:03:06.609> thin<00:03:07.180> on<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.900> sides<00:03:08.169> as<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.739> can<00:03:09.069> see

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
really thin on the sides as you can see

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.899 
really thin on the sides as you can see
so<00:03:09.790> we<00:03:10.450> will<00:03:10.599> see<00:03:10.870> how<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.079> goes<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:12.489> may<00:03:12.669> want

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
so we will see how it goes we may want

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.339 
so we will see how it goes we may want
to<00:03:13.209> align<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.169> to<00:03:14.199> the<00:03:14.669> home<00:03:15.669> button<00:03:15.970> oh<00:03:16.269> my<00:03:17.229> god

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
to align it to the home button oh my god

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:24.489 
to align it to the home button oh my god
this<00:03:17.500> thing<00:03:17.829> is<00:03:17.859> sticky

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:24.499 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:37.580
