00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello everybody here is reginaldo ferreira 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 director of nautical and caio marini 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.529
 we recorded a video today talking to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 respect of the balance of your boat 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.930
 This is a question that many people have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.350
 times the boat sails careening into a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 side or to the other military navigates 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.810
 very much saved that we talk a lot 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.180
 rear or very forward 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 then in addition to other adjustments that we 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.950
 we already showed 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 the power trim of the outboard one of the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 very important factors that you should 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.890
 to observe in your boat we are going 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.309
 show now in water 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 it is balanced, that is, if the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.820
 weight is well distributed within the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.789
 your neighborhood 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 the ideal position as you should be 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.600
 seeing in the video is the boat she is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.379
 lightly with the stern but into the water 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.060
 and to prove a little more raised and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.220
 also a uniformity in the boat ie 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 it is not bent either to one side or 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 for the other, as you can see without 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.439
 marking it is well distributed 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.270
 the fuel tank batteries ne 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.650
 the equipment we carry has 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 fishing gear and it takes a lot 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.470
 also helps in the imbalance of the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.390
 vessel that is if you have to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.210
 your vessel with shapes is showing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 in the video as you saw it now 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.500
 balanced is much easier for you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.960
 time to surf to have a performance 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
 best of your boat and will also 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.780
 contribute greatly to the consumption of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 fuel 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 a balanced vessel it changes the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 your way to navigate 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.329
 so that's it, stay there but this tip 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 How did you see? 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.399
 It's nothing extraordinary, it's just 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.219
 a weight distribution you talk about 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.040
 on your boat so that it stays a 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.850
 really nice way to navigate as 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.399
 ever 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
