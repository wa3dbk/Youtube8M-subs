 because of different styles of music 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.780
 that I 'm doing ok so here I see a style 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 a very small zouk so what is this 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.710

 rap or other music 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.930

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.100

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.390
