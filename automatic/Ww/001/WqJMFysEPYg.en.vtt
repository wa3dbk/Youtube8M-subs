 how to stand out from competitors 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.349
 when we propose almost the same 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.269
 components that inside his 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.100
 smartphone by forcing a little things 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.989
 and yes exactly as it was the case 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.579
 a few months ago for galaxy s 4 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.230
 samsung took this week in 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.150
 flagrant doping offense for the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.010
 benchmark of his latestborn the galaxy 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.300
 note 3 it's not about cheating at 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 strictly speaking but rather in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.570
 performance bypass 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.579
 usual smartphone with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.930
 overclocking in clear as soon as he 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.000
 detects a benchmark application 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.800
 galaxy note 3 but all sails out 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.109
 and overclock his processor for him 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 to provide about 120 % of 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.320
 his usual abilities leaves in 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.129
 make the battery suffer and do a little 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.960
 overheating the engine 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 questioned at the time of the release of the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 galaxy s 4 and this famous samsung bench 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.600
 denied having voluntarily boosted 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.100
 smartphone performance and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.869
 apparently it's still the case on the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.039
 note 3 this is the ars technica site which 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.420
 noticed 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.000
 when he compared the performance of the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.640
 # 3 with that of the LG2 equipped with the same 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.250
 snapdragon 800 processor running at 2.3 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.470
 giguère detail fun even with the mode 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.660
 of disable disable the note 3 remains a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.220
 little more powerful than the g2 but it is 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.780
 know all this is not the power that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.000
 does the quality of a smartphone is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.679
 not good and gets unlocked waiting for the
