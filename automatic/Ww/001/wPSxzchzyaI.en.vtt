a lot of hydras on the way this could be

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.010 
a lot of hydras on the way this could be
it<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.910> always<00:00:18.029> another<00:00:18.390> already<00:00:18.810> lose

the charge void only two left air
weapons<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.080> finishing<00:00:22.590> soon

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
weapons is going to be finishing soon

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.509 
weapons is going to be finishing soon
that<00:00:24.000> could<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.359> quite<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> difference<00:00:24.600> if

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
that could make quite a difference if

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
that could make quite a difference if
we're<00:00:26.519> yourself<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> relatively<00:00:27.300> quick<00:00:27.599> rate

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we're yourself a relatively quick rate

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.710 
we're yourself a relatively quick rate
of<00:00:28.170> fire<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.849> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.939> air<00:00:30.210> weapons<00:00:30.359> makes

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of fire so you know air weapons makes

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.650 
of fire so you know air weapons makes
quite<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> big<00:00:31.140> difference<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:32.420> yeah<00:00:33.420> most

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
quite a big difference on them yeah most

have<00:01:32.850> seen<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.450> poking<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
have seen actually poking in here at the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.280 
have seen actually poking in here at the
third<00:01:34.439> base<00:01:34.759> but<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.329> does<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> top<00:01:37.140> at

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
third base but it does see that a top at

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.610 
third base but it does see that a top at
least<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
least and

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.770

suny<00:01:39.130> hockey<00:01:39.490> does<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:39.820> six<00:01:40.150> void<00:01:40.360> rays<00:01:40.630> now

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
suny hockey does have six void rays now

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.140 
suny hockey does have six void rays now
see<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.740> build<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.310> extremely<00:01:43.090> strong

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
see this this build is extremely strong

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.090 
see this this build is extremely strong
I<00:01:43.450> don't<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.810> any<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.050> Equator<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.710> really

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
I don't think any the Equator is really

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.150 
I don't think any the Equator is really
figured<00:01:45.430> out<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.580> strong<00:01:45.970> defense<00:01:46.480> to<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:46.780> yet

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
figured out a strong defense to it yet

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.400 
figured out a strong defense to it yet
because<00:01:48.160> you<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.550> cut<00:01:48.730> off<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.880> void<00:01:49.120> rays

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
because you just cut off the void rays

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.660 
because you just cut off the void rays
sorry<00:01:50.410> cut<00:01:50.590> up<00:01:50.680> with<00:01:50.770> hydras<00:01:51.220> with<00:01:51.400> force

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
nice macro game the problem I can see

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.660 
nice macro game the problem I can see
with<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.020> if<00:02:53.170> Kiwi<00:02:53.800> cocky<00:02:54.160> does<00:02:54.370> decide

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
with this is if Kiwi cocky does decide

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.390 
with this is if Kiwi cocky does decide
to<00:02:54.730> push<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.270> doesn't<00:02:56.140> give<00:02:56.260> sin<00:02:56.590> enough<00:02:57.040> time

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
to push and doesn't give sin enough time

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.130 
to push and doesn't give sin enough time
to<00:02:57.610> reinforce<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.360> could<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.630> all<00:02:58.720> over<00:02:58.870> right

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
to reinforce it could be all over right

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.770 
to reinforce it could be all over right
there<00:02:59.350> but<00:02:59.620> this<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.760> same<00:03:01.000> build<00:03:01.300> versus

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
there but this is the same build versus

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.210 
there but this is the same build versus
the<00:03:01.900> same<00:03:02.140> kind<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.500> counter<00:03:02.800> build<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.100> we

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the same kind of counter build that we

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.390 
the same kind of counter build that we
saw<00:03:03.459> its<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:03.940> used<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.480> pretty<00:03:04.750> almost<00:03:05.400> take

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
saw its then used to pretty almost take

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.130 
saw its then used to pretty almost take
a<00:03:06.430> win<00:03:06.670> off<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.030> Cuba<00:03:07.239> cocky<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:07.780> Xel'Naga

here<00:04:14.860> in<00:04:15.100> his<00:04:15.250> army<00:04:15.550> so<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:15.790> could<00:04:15.970> be<00:04:16.060> seeing

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
here in his army so we could be seeing

here in his army so we could be seeing
some<00:04:16.390> funky<00:04:16.660> rose<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:17.080> these<00:04:17.290> water<00:04:17.530> is

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
some funky rose on these water is
