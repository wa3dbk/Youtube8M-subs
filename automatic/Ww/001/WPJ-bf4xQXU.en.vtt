00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
that the rain will happen so that's the

front pocket let's take a look inside

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.200 
front pocket let's take a look inside
now<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.310> bag<00:01:36.520> opens<00:01:36.880> up<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.060> little

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
now this bag opens up a little

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.789 
now this bag opens up a little
differently<00:01:37.360> as<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.840> mentioned<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:38.649> when

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
differently as I mentioned so when

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.710 
differently as I mentioned so when
you're<00:01:38.920> wearing<00:01:39.189> it<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:40.000> zippers<00:01:40.360> are<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
you're wearing it the zippers are in the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.760 
you're wearing it the zippers are in the
back<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.280> opens<00:01:42.700> back<00:01:43.329> to<00:01:43.689> front<00:01:43.990> now<00:01:44.590> this

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
back and it opens back to front now this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.170 
back and it opens back to front now this
takes<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.070> little<00:01:45.189> bit<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.520> getting<00:01:45.670> used<00:01:45.790> to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
takes a little bit of getting used to

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.230 
takes a little bit of getting used to
but<00:01:46.329> I<00:01:46.540> can<00:01:46.720> understand<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.439> design<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:49.119> the

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
but I can understand this design for the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.690 
but I can understand this design for the
most<00:01:49.540> part<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.500> enables<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.159> access

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
most part this enables you to access

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.569 
most part this enables you to access
your<00:01:51.850> bag<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.020> flap<00:01:53.259> away<00:01:53.590> from<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.040> you

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
your bag with the flap away from you you

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.700 
your bag with the flap away from you you
