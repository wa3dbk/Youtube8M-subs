from<00:01:48.789> that<00:01:49.060> backward<00:01:49.450> edge<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:50.530> want<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> grip

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
from that backward edge you want to grip

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.090 
from that backward edge you want to grip
on<00:01:51.250> liquor<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.539> fall<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.409> he's<00:01:53.799> got<00:01:54.039> a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
on liquor and have it fall is he's got a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.580 
on liquor and have it fall is he's got a
grip<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.880> tool<00:01:55.119> from<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.020> you're<00:01:56.560> going

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
grip on that tool from that you're going

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.490 
grip on that tool from that you're going
to<00:01:56.740> care<00:01:57.039> good<00:01:57.520> go<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.270> lift<00:01:58.569> your<00:01:58.750> knee<00:01:58.960> juicy

to care good go and lift your knee juicy
hit<00:01:59.740> each<00:02:00.009> position

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
hit each position

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.510 
hit each position
okay<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.929> I'll<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.350> cross<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.920> lines<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.340> can

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
okay so I'll do cross the lines you can

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.249 
okay so I'll do cross the lines you can
see<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.700> little<00:02:03.909> bit<00:02:04.090> back<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.539> do<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:04.990> three

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
see a little bit back to do the three

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.199 
see a little bit back to do the three
turn<00:02:05.530> back<00:02:06.220> check<00:02:06.780> through<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.560> my<00:02:08.739> leg<00:02:08.950> up

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
turn back check through it's my leg up

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.240 
turn back check through it's my leg up
and<00:02:10.209> then<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.450> should<00:02:10.750> be<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.860> cage

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and then I should be in that cage

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.370 
and then I should be in that cage
position<00:02:12.850> as<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> leaf<00:02:13.239> like<00:02:13.569> pretty<00:02:14.019> much<00:02:14.049> like

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
position as a leaf like pretty much like

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.699 
position as a leaf like pretty much like
the<00:02:14.560> wall<00:02:14.769> show<00:02:15.100> okay<00:02:16.110> okay<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.380> take-off

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the wall show okay okay so the take-off

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.870 
the wall show okay okay so the take-off
on<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> ice<00:02:18.100> should<00:02:18.340> look<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.700> little

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
on the ice should look like a little

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.320 
on the ice should look like a little
tick<00:02:19.209> okay<00:02:19.989> or<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.950> also<00:02:21.160> known<00:02:21.310> as<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> can

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
tick okay or it's also known as it can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.600 
tick okay or it's also known as it can
be<00:02:22.450> called<00:02:22.630> flag<00:02:22.959> okay<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:24.130> as<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> carry

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
be called flag okay so as you carry

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.490 
be called flag okay so as you carry
around<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.090> grips<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.600> curl<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.230> switch

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
around it grips that curl and switch

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.310 
around it grips that curl and switch
forward<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.400> should<00:02:27.579> give<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:27.970> nice

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
forward and it should give it that nice

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.199 
forward and it should give it that nice
texture<00:02:29.320> another<00:02:29.829> important<00:02:30.489> part<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
texture another important part the

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.090 
texture another important part the
sophism<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:31.870> making<00:02:32.200> sure<00:02:32.320> your<00:02:32.470> eyes<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
sophism is making sure your eyes and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.610 
sophism is making sure your eyes and
your<00:02:33.190> head

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
your head

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.220 
your head
facing<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.459> correct<00:02:34.730> direction<00:02:34.879> so<00:02:35.870> from<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
facing the correct direction so from the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.149 
facing the correct direction so from the
three<00:02:36.440> turn<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.299> left<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:39.159> straight

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
three turn to the left on the straight

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.080 
three turn to the left on the straight
ahead<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.090> algebra

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
ahead then algebra

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.470 
ahead then algebra
we're<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> keep<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.370> head<00:02:44.670> over

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
we're going to keep them the head over

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.839 
we're going to keep them the head over
the<00:02:45.599> right<00:02:45.930> side<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.560> your<00:02:46.590> body<00:02:46.860> cases<00:02:47.580> us<00:02:47.670> if

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the right side of your body cases us if

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.880 
the right side of your body cases us if
you<00:02:48.000> retain<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.720> left<00:02:48.930> alright<00:02:49.590> because

you retain to the left alright because

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.740 
you retain to the left alright because
that's<00:02:50.160> going<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.340> enable<00:02:50.700> us<00:02:51.000> when<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.390> do

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that's going to enable us when we do

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's going to enable us when we do
start<00:02:52.080> doing<00:02:52.230> double<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:53.040> get<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.310> that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
start doing double to get in that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.520 
start doing double to get in that
rotation<00:02:53.790> over<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.599> right<00:02:54.780> hips<00:02:55.020> as<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> come
