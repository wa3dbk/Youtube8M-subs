crystal ones so as you can see those are

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.470 
crystal ones so as you can see those are
that's<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.839> inner<00:00:16.020> lights<00:00:17.900> LEDs<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> top

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that's the inner lights LEDs and the top

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.880 
that's the inner lights LEDs and the top
pasilla<00:00:21.900> same<00:00:22.109> halogen<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:24.410> both<00:00:25.410> sides<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
pasilla same halogen on both sides I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
pasilla same halogen on both sides I
changed<00:00:28.890> them<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.849> had<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> pole<00:00:31.080> right

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
changed them because I had a pole right

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
changed them because I had a pole right
here<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> paint<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> chipped

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
here that's what the paint is chipped

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.110 
here that's what the paint is chipped
all<00:00:33.090> around<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> my<00:00:35.910> lens

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
all around right here and so my lens

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.450 
all around right here and so my lens
cracks<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:36.809> original<00:00:36.930> ones<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.860> said

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
cracks on my original ones so I said

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.160 
cracks on my original ones so I said
might<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.270> LEDs<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.020> we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
might as well go get some LEDs now so we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.569 
might as well go get some LEDs now so we
didn't<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> change<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:41.040> otherwise<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
didn't want to change one otherwise it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.290 
didn't want to change one otherwise it
would<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.820> different

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
would look different

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
would look different
so<00:00:42.960> let<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.469> turn<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> lights

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
so let me had to go turn on the lights

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.229 
so let me had to go turn on the lights
for<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> guys<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> show<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> looks

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
for you guys and show you what it looks

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
for you guys and show you what it looks
like

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.759 

so<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.359> looks<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> camera<00:00:58.260> isn't<00:00:58.500> really

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
so it looks like the camera isn't really

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.619 
so it looks like the camera isn't really
giving<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> clear<00:00:59.339> color<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.269> giving<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
giving a clear color it's not giving you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.990 
giving a clear color it's not giving you
the<00:01:00.780> exact<00:01:01.019> color<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.679> are

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
the exact color that they actually are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.380 
the exact color that they actually are
but<00:01:03.979> as<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.309> they're<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.729> LEDs<00:01:06.180> now

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but as you can see they're all LEDs now

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020 
but as you can see they're all LEDs now
an<00:01:07.189> indicator<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> little<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.759> clear

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
an indicator is a little more clear

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.190 
an indicator is a little more clear
because<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.720> lens<00:01:09.899> is<00:01:10.080> clear<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.840> looks<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> lot

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because the lens is clear it looks a lot

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
because the lens is clear it looks a lot
better<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.619> person<00:01:16.830> doesn't<00:01:17.250> they're<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
better in person doesn't they're good of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.480 
better in person doesn't they're good of
camera

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.730 

so<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.030> looks<00:01:29.180> like<00:01:29.300> this<00:01:29.450> has<00:01:29.690> like<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.020> 2010

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
so it looks like this has like the 2010

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.080 
so it looks like this has like the 2010
