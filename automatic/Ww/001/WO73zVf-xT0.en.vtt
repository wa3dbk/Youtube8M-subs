how much from it as is not much being

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.870 
how much from it as is not much being

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
featured in it you can of course the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.550 
featured in it you can of course the
characters<00:04:31.390> wearing<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.810> balaclavas<00:04:32.200> and

characters wearing the balaclavas and
the<00:04:32.680> gloves<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.490> location<00:04:33.730> itself<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.360> a

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
the gloves but the location itself is a

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.270 
the gloves but the location itself is a
complete<00:04:34.930> mystery<00:04:35.350> but<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.950> was<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.100> take<00:04:36.220> a

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
complete mystery but if I was to take a

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.590 
complete mystery but if I was to take a
guess<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.700> would<00:04:36.760> say<00:04:36.940> it's<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> aircraft

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
guess I would say it's the aircraft

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.960 
guess I would say it's the aircraft
carrier<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.200> finally<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.250> last<00:04:39.280> image<00:04:39.730> being

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
carrier and finally the last image being

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.880 
carrier and finally the last image being
displayed<00:04:40.360> in<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.570> video<00:04:40.780> right<00:04:41.020> now<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.530> our

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
displayed in the video right now is our

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.920 
displayed in the video right now is our
two<00:04:42.100> characters<00:04:42.610> outside<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.270> humane<00:04:43.720> labs

two characters outside the humane labs

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.570 
two characters outside the humane labs

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
which would suggest there is going to be

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.460 
which would suggest there is going to be
a<00:04:45.640> heist<00:04:45.880> mission<00:04:46.240> taking<00:04:46.810> place<00:04:47.020> at<00:04:47.200> this
