very<00:01:35.610> skinny<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> loop<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
very skinny and I'm going to loop it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.600 
very skinny and I'm going to loop it
around<00:01:38.930> my<00:01:39.930> handle<00:01:40.470> okay<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.400> going

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
around my handle okay that's just going

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
around my handle okay that's just going
to<00:01:41.700> secure<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.180> i<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.450> start<00:01:42.540> piling<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to secure it so i can start piling it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
to secure it so i can start piling it
then<00:01:43.560> i'm<00:01:43.829> gonna<00:01:43.979> stick<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.490> large<00:01:44.700> handle

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
then i'm gonna stick this large handle

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
then i'm gonna stick this large handle
in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.180> larger<00:01:45.630> holes<00:01:45.869> there's<00:01:46.710> large<00:01:46.979> holes

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in the larger holes there's large holes

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
in the larger holes there's large holes
for<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> larger<00:01:47.759> handle<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.240> small<00:01:48.509> holes

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
for the larger handle and small holes

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
for the larger handle and small holes
with<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> smaller<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:50.540> alright<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.100> then<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
with a smaller one alright and then I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
with a smaller one alright and then I
just<00:01:53.520> tuck<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.570> turn<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.049> away

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
just tuck that back you turn it away

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
just tuck that back you turn it away
from<00:01:55.710> yourself<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.850> gonna<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
from yourself I'm just gonna do a little

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
from yourself I'm just gonna do a little
bit<00:01:57.420> closer<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.530> kind<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
bit closer in there and that kind of

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.179 
bit closer in there and that kind of
guides<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.149> holding<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.719> spool

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
guides it and I'm just holding the spool

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
guides it and I'm just holding the spool
this<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.640> free<00:02:03.090> hand<00:02:03.469> your<00:02:04.469> coil<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
quite a look how fast it goes can you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.510 
quite a look how fast it goes can you
see<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.570> coil<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.680> asking<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.099> questions

five bucks I have gotten five dollars
for<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> fun<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.930> already<00:02:28.200> let<00:02:28.770> me

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
for the fun out of this already let me

tell you this is just cool and if you do

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.450 
tell you this is just cool and if you do
find<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:31.680> space<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.890> shove<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
find you get a little space to shove the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.650 
find you get a little space to shove the
handle<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> little<00:02:36.360> bit<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.600> it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
handle in and in a little bit and it

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.300 
handle in and in a little bit and it
will<00:02:36.780> kind<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.230> compress<00:02:37.530> those<00:02:37.740> coils<00:02:38.160> back

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
will kind of compress those coils back

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
will kind of compress those coils back
up<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.670> bit<00:02:38.820> less<00:02:39.090> fun<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> want<00:02:40.200> to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
up a little bit less fun but you want to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
up a little bit less fun but you want to
try<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.280> could<00:02:41.430> probably<00:02:41.610> even<00:02:41.820> rig

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
try it you could probably even rig

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.720 
try it you could probably even rig
something<00:02:42.270> up<00:02:42.510> yourself<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.250> coil<00:02:44.580> wire

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
something up yourself to to coil wire

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.860 
something up yourself to to coil wire
you<00:02:44.910> couldn't<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.300> know<00:02:45.330> if<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.600> just<00:02:45.750> want

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you couldn't you know if you just want

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
you couldn't you know if you just want
to<00:02:45.900> coil<00:02:46.140> wire<00:02:46.380> um<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> want<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> buy

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
to coil wire um and you want to buy

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.280 
to coil wire um and you want to buy
anything<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.870> know<00:02:48.960> wind<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.260> around

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
anything you can you know wind it around

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.290 
anything you can you know wind it around
a<00:02:49.500> bamboo<00:02:49.860> skewer<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.370> knitting<00:02:50.820> needle<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:51.210> it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
a bamboo skewer a knitting needle but it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.330 
a bamboo skewer a knitting needle but it
wouldn't<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.660> fast<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.710> bet<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.010> even

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
wouldn't be this fast but I bet if even

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.590 
wouldn't be this fast but I bet if even
if<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.520> live<00:02:53.670> somewhere<00:02:53.700> where<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.300> can't

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
if you live somewhere where you can't

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
if you live somewhere where you can't
find<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.230> coiling<00:02:55.500> gizmo<00:02:55.650> you'd<00:02:56.580> probably

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
find a coiling gizmo you'd probably

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.060 
find a coiling gizmo you'd probably
rigged<00:02:57.120> something<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.500> probably<00:02:58.950> not

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
rigged something up to but probably not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.190 
rigged something up to but probably not

tug to secure it and then I slide the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.300 
tug to secure it and then I slide the
handle<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.920> use<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:11.580> wire<00:03:11.850> snippers<00:03:13.310> just

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
handle out and use my wire snippers just

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.980 
handle out and use my wire snippers just
to<00:03:14.550> snip<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.120> saw<00:03:15.330> day<00:03:15.510> they<00:03:15.690> give<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
to snip it and I saw day they give it a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.330 
to snip it and I saw day they give it a
little<00:03:16.110> diagram<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.710> back<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:16.950> shows

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
little diagram on the back that shows

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.530 
little diagram on the back that shows
you<00:03:17.520> how<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.960> how<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:18.990> use<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.470> they<00:03:19.680> showed

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
you how to how to use it and they showed

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
you how to how to use it and they showed
you<00:03:21.540> putting<00:03:21.900> coiling<00:03:22.710> some<00:03:22.890> wire<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
you putting coiling some wire and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.760 
you putting coiling some wire and
putting<00:03:23.550> like<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.810> skinny<00:03:25.140> wire<00:03:25.350> over<00:03:25.740> a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
putting like the skinny wire over a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.140 
putting like the skinny wire over a
bigger<00:03:26.070> wire<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.370> thought<00:03:26.730> they<00:03:26.880> look<00:03:27.030> pretty

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
bigger wire I thought they look pretty

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.130 
bigger wire I thought they look pretty
cool<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.480> I'm<00:03:27.540> gonna<00:03:27.660> show<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.810> how<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.990> do

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
cool so I'm gonna show you how to do

gauge not real silver wire and I'm a
coil<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.510> bit<00:04:06.860> actually<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.040> probably<00:04:08.190> should

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
coil a bit actually I probably should

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.830 
coil a bit actually I probably should
cut<00:04:08.610> my<00:04:08.640> wire<00:04:09.200> ahead<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.290> time<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.910> then<00:04:11.910> I'm

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
cut my wire ahead of time and then I'm

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.110 
cut my wire ahead of time and then I'm
actually<00:04:13.020> going<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.380> just<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:13.770> of<00:04:13.920> pull<00:04:14.910> off

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
actually going to just kind of pull off

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.270 
actually going to just kind of pull off
some<00:04:15.900> wire<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.470> snip<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.040> I've<00:04:17.160> got<00:04:17.400> about

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
some wire and snip it so I've got about

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.010 
some wire and snip it so I've got about
18<00:04:20.280> inches<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.609> wire<00:04:20.730> here<00:04:21.120> I've<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.420> snipped

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
18 inches of wire here I've just snipped

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.170 
18 inches of wire here I've just snipped
it<00:04:22.109> off<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:22.890> going<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.100> slide<00:04:23.400> my<00:04:23.430> coil

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
it off and I'm going to slide my coil

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.620 
it off and I'm going to slide my coil
but<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.140> made<00:04:25.320> him<00:04:25.410> in<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> go<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.979> there

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
but I just made him in a go on there

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.770 
but I just made him in a go on there
a<00:04:27.610> million<00:04:28.610> frames<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.090> such<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.240> weird<00:04:29.360> camera

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
a million frames is such a weird camera

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.450 
a million frames is such a weird camera
angle<00:04:30.050> but<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.740> didn't<00:04:31.130> even<00:04:31.220> think<00:04:31.340> about

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
angle but I I didn't even think about

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.180 
angle but I I didn't even think about
doing<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.820> video<00:04:31.940> when<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.240> mounted<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.990> my

you're working with wire to straighten
this<00:05:57.950> end<00:05:58.220> out<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:59.000> do<00:05:59.180> it<00:05:59.620> wrapped<00:06:00.620> loop<00:06:00.800> on

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
this end out and do it wrapped loop on

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.350 
this end out and do it wrapped loop on
this<00:06:01.070> end<00:06:01.250> i<00:06:01.370> can<00:06:01.490> only<00:06:01.550> do<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.760> simple<00:06:02.030> loop<00:06:02.210> on
