00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.130 
to build that and I mean I feel pretty
lucky<00:01:46.649> I've<00:01:46.920> been<00:01:47.040> part<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> we

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
lucky I've been part of it we

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.020 
lucky I've been part of it we
shouldn't<00:01:48.409> do<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.680> like<00:01:48.950> any<00:01:49.159> time<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.700> it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
shouldn't do that like any time and it's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.660 
shouldn't do that like any time and it's
cool<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:50.390> tried<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:51.380> just<00:01:51.590> yet<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.130> put

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
cool we tried it but just yet to put

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.120 
cool we tried it but just yet to put
more<00:01:52.940> features<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.720> one<00:01:54.020> pipe<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.620> maybe<00:01:54.979> have

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
more features in one pipe and maybe have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.240 
more features in one pipe and maybe have
jam<00:01:55.520> sessions<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.270> there<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:57.590> makes<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:57.979> hard

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
jam sessions in there that makes it hard

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.070 
jam sessions in there that makes it hard
for<00:01:58.340> TV<00:01:58.790> as<00:01:58.909> well<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.540> know<00:01:59.659> it's<00:01:59.840> hard<00:01:59.960> to

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
for TV as well you know it's hard to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.830 
for TV as well you know it's hard to
find<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.470> good<00:02:00.520> solutions<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:02.420> cool<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
find a good solutions but it's cool to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.619 
find a good solutions but it's cool to
to<00:02:03.140> try<00:02:03.380> new<00:02:03.590> stuff
