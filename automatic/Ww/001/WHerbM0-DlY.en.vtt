cutting my food doing more cardio and
I'm<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.719> seeing<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> changes<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I'm not seeing the changes that I you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
I'm not seeing the changes that I you
know<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.559> they're<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
know would like they're just kind of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.980 
know would like they're just kind of
going<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.659> slower<00:01:07.049> than<00:01:08.990> was

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
going a little bit slower than was

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
going a little bit slower than was
anticipated<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.369> partially

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
anticipated but that is partially

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.850 
anticipated but that is partially
because<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> how<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.869> didn't<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> proper

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
because of how I didn't do a proper

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
because of how I didn't do a proper
reverse<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.390> watch<00:01:15.570> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
reverse so that you know go watch my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.499 
reverse so that you know go watch my
reverse<00:01:16.020> dining<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> any

questions<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
questions on that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
questions on that
and<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.490> try<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> come<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.030> with

and I'm really gonna try to come up with
the<00:01:21.240> better<00:01:21.360> system<00:01:21.950> after<00:01:22.950> doing<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> ton<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the better system after doing a ton of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249 
the better system after doing a ton of
preps<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> perfect

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
preps and I know you know the perfect

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
preps and I know you know the perfect
way<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> didn't<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
way to do it and then I didn't do that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
way to do it and then I didn't do that
way<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.390> obviously<00:01:27.990> last<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
obviously you want to just use fat but

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.819 
obviously you want to just use fat but
towards<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> after<00:01:58.409> you've<00:01:58.530> been<00:01:58.619> prepping

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
towards the after you've been prepping

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.700 
towards the after you've been prepping
for<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.100> while<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.700> happens<00:02:00.290> my<00:02:01.290> rmr

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
for a while this kind of happens my rmr

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.990 
for a while this kind of happens my rmr
actually<00:02:02.100> stayed<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> same

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually stayed about the same

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.870 
actually stayed about the same
I'm<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.200> good<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.530> body<00:02:04.710> fat<00:02:04.950> went<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.399> 1%

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I'm just good my body fat went down 1%

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.220 
I'm just good my body fat went down 1%
so<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.479> 12.6%<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
so I'm at 12.6% and my the some of the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.100 
so I'm at 12.6% and my the some of the
ultrasound<00:02:13.099> millimeters<00:02:14.000> has<00:02:14.390> gone<00:02:14.599> from<00:02:14.900> 30

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
ultrasound millimeters has gone from 30

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.440 
ultrasound millimeters has gone from 30
point<00:02:15.440> three<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:16.129> twenty<00:02:16.610> seven<00:02:17.000> point<00:02:17.150> four

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
point three to twenty seven point four

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.380 
point three to twenty seven point four
so<00:02:18.200> there<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.769> been<00:02:18.980> pretty<00:02:19.849> uniform

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
so there have been pretty uniform

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.080 
so there have been pretty uniform
decreases<00:02:21.170> everywhere<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.340> not

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
decreases everywhere you know not

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.119 
decreases everywhere you know not
necessarily<00:02:23.239> spot<00:02:23.870> specific<00:02:24.470> everywhere<00:02:25.040> has

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
necessarily spot specific everywhere has

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.280 
necessarily spot specific everywhere has
just<00:02:25.280> kind<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.519> gone<00:02:25.670> down<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.940> little<00:02:26.209> bit<00:02:26.480> like

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290

do them I kind of talk about this a

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.659 
do them I kind of talk about this a
little<00:03:36.049> bit<00:03:36.260> before<00:03:36.560> but<00:03:36.590> if<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:36.950> do<00:03:37.010> them<00:03:37.370> where

little bit before but if I do them where
I'm<00:03:37.819> on<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.000> machine<00:03:38.209> I'll<00:03:38.599> do<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> traditional

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
I'm on a machine I'll do the traditional

I'm on a machine I'll do the traditional
warm-up<00:03:39.799> cooldown<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:40.940> kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.239> get<00:03:41.329> that

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
warm-up cooldown so I kind of get that

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.599 
warm-up cooldown so I kind of get that
moderate<00:03:41.810> intensity<00:03:42.139> cardio<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.769> but<00:03:43.340> if<00:03:43.459> I'm

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
moderate intensity cardio in but if I'm

not<00:03:43.639> on<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> machine<00:03:44.209> then<00:03:44.599> I'll<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.840> if<00:03:45.199> I'm

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
not on a machine then I'll just if I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.869 
not on a machine then I'll just if I'm
doing<00:03:45.709> like<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.889> Prowler<00:03:46.160> which<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.519> do<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.669> lot

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.770 
week but it smokes to be like not
supposed<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.699> be<00:04:16.789> super<00:04:17.030> taxing<00:04:17.449> but<00:04:17.599> it's

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
supposed to be super taxing but it's

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.020 
supposed to be super taxing but it's
about<00:04:17.930> 45<00:04:18.260> seconds<00:04:18.739> rest<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.459> good

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
about 45 seconds rest so it's good

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.780 
about 45 seconds rest so it's good
amount<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.329> work<00:04:20.479> in<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.750> short<00:04:20.900> amount<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.260> time

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
amount of work in a short amount of time

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.110 
amount of work in a short amount of time

and I actually added that on one of my
upper<00:04:25.510> body<00:04:25.660> days<00:04:26.160> because<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:27.670> I<00:04:27.940> do<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.300> my

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
goes it was pretty good I liked it I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.890 
goes it was pretty good I liked it I
mean<00:04:45.640> obviously<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:46.120> was<00:04:46.210> very<00:04:46.720> challenging

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
mean obviously it was very challenging

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.030 
mean obviously it was very challenging
but<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.890> added<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.670> kind<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.120> upper<00:04:49.420> body

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
but it added to that kind of upper body

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.700 
but it added to that kind of upper body
day<00:04:51.040> where<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:52.210> know<00:04:52.240> obviously<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.320> can<00:04:53.590> get

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
day where you know obviously you can get

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.620 
day where you know obviously you can get
good<00:04:53.920> work<00:04:54.040> in<00:04:54.250> but<00:04:54.400> it's<00:04:54.550> nothing<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.390> leg

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
good work in but it's nothing like a leg

I dropped my food some more so I'm

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.160 
I dropped my food some more so I'm
getting<00:05:00.130> pretty<00:05:00.400> low<00:05:00.610> but<00:05:00.970> it's<00:05:01.300> time<00:05:01.570> you

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
getting pretty low but it's time you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.820 
know it's it's time to get to get lean
so<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.290> don't<00:05:05.560> think<00:05:05.860> I'll<00:05:06.280> be<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:07.150> same<00:05:07.360> weight

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
so I don't think I'll be the same weight

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.350 
so I don't think I'll be the same weight
on<00:05:08.830> stage<00:05:09.130> maybe<00:05:09.700> I'll<00:05:09.880> be<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.030> little<00:05:10.270> bit

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
on stage maybe I'll be a little bit

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.690 
on stage maybe I'll be a little bit
heavier<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.900> know<00:05:11.830> like<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.280> said<00:05:12.340> I've<00:05:12.550> added

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
heavier I know like I said I've added

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.430 
heavier I know like I said I've added
size<00:05:13.060> I've<00:05:13.360> added<00:05:13.480> muscle<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.200> that's

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
size I've added muscle so that's

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.190 
size I've added muscle so that's
probably<00:05:14.710> expected<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.870> we're<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.020> gonna

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
change my work I don't really changed my

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.830 
change my work I don't really changed my
hit<00:06:14.170> just<00:06:14.470> kind<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.710> goes<00:06:14.890> down<00:06:15.480> my<00:06:16.480> workouts

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
hit just kind of goes down my workouts

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.630 
hit just kind of goes down my workouts
usually<00:06:17.260> get<00:06:17.410> a<00:06:17.440> little<00:06:17.740> bit<00:06:17.830> stronger<00:06:18.160> and

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
usually get a little bit stronger and

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.780 
usually get a little bit stronger and
sometimes<00:06:19.480> longer<00:06:19.960> less<00:06:20.410> frequency<00:06:20.860> when<00:06:21.760> I

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
sometimes longer less frequency when I

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.790 
sometimes longer less frequency when I
prep<00:06:22.180> I<00:06:22.390> feel<00:06:22.690> as<00:06:22.870> though<00:06:22.900> I<00:06:23.020> don't<00:06:23.260> give<00:06:23.590> I

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
prep I feel as though I don't give I

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.830 
prep I feel as though I don't give I
can't<00:06:24.070> give<00:06:24.250> as<00:06:24.370> much<00:06:24.520> intensity<00:06:25.000> for<00:06:25.390> as<00:06:25.570> long

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
can't give as much intensity for as long

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.080 
can't give as much intensity for as long
so<00:06:26.530> I'd<00:06:26.710> rather<00:06:26.890> work<00:06:27.190> out<00:06:27.400> more<00:06:27.610> frequently

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
so I'd rather work out more frequently

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.950 
so I'd rather work out more frequently
but<00:06:28.690> for<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.410> shorter<00:06:29.770> amount<00:06:29.800> of<00:06:30.010> time<00:06:30.810> so<00:06:31.810> yeah

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
but for a shorter amount of time so yeah

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.650
