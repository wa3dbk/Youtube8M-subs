00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.330 
dog we can make an uncharted series and
the<00:04:01.759> thing<00:04:01.970> is<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.590> feel<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:03.769> this<00:04:04.009> should<00:04:04.040> be

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
the thing is I feel like this should be

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.330 
the thing is I feel like this should be
the<00:04:04.669> last<00:04:04.699> series<00:04:05.269> within<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:05.959> charted

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
the last series within the in charted

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.149 
the last series within the in charted
community<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.549> like<00:04:08.470> I'm<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.769> saying<00:04:09.949> it

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
community and like I'm just saying it

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.679 
community and like I'm just saying it
should<00:04:10.310> be<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.519> last<00:04:10.639> series<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.419> reason

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
should be the last series and the reason

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.490 
should be the last series and the reason
I<00:04:11.780> say<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.259> because<00:04:12.439> I<00:04:13.069> feel<00:04:13.819> that<00:04:14.500> since

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
I say that is because I feel that since

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.360 
I say that is because I feel that since
this<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:15.859> first<00:04:16.039> um<00:04:17.139> Naughty<00:04:18.139> Dog<00:04:18.409> thing
