00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello everyone today we will talk about 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.480
 displacement of the beam even from the factory can be 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.910
 go already shifted beam to the right or left 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.580
 how to eliminate it we take under the roof 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.359
 the car 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 we drive into the pit on the lift and 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:36.750
 unscrew the three nuts now I tell you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:39.770
 show often style three nuts let go with 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.770
 one side and the other 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.920
 on the other then a beautiful typewriter and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.469
 put it or right door or 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.359
 left depending where you have a wheel 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.190
 where is closer 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:59.670
 we still had another story here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 there was a tank still biased forward to us 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.949
 drove over to the boiled motorcycle here are the marks here 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.590
 just left here a little bit and he's like 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.870
 once here here the blow fell on the center 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 wheel I do not know how he flew the machine 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.640
 standing it turned out that she went there 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.010
 gone to rack and of the point of almost all 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 everyone pulled it all came out became on 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.530
 place everything is fine here everything is peaks 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.460
 here from a little bit here while the little thing departed 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.860
 so everything is perfect that I wrote in place 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.920
 everyone pulled 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 well, naturally we leveled 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.220
 the beam went and there the cinnamon went to the right there 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.090
 the wheel was 9 millimeters larger than 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.979
 here the legs are the right side of ours we 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.070
 did but also unwind the 6 bolts 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.799
 fell here and measured naturally 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 gaps between control points there 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.270
 there are checkpoints can find by 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.299
 car on each of the nine or the floor 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.289
 liked my internet all have it 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.060
 look from america 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:14.300
 America and so everything is measured and clean 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.250
 it is possible to set screws 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.220
 and for tighten and beam on the spot to whom 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.959
 like subscribe ask 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 questions that I will not explain in more detail 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.120
 until 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.120
 like put
