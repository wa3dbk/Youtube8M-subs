back there's actually some pictures from

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.859 
back there's actually some pictures from
probably<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> actual<00:00:19.730> comic<00:00:20.730> strip<00:00:21.029> there's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
probably the actual comic strip there's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.099 
probably the actual comic strip there's
a<00:00:21.930> picture<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.250> head<00:00:23.490> shot<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.109> antivenom

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and you can kind of see more back here

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.950 
and you can kind of see more back here
of<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.439> picture<00:00:28.939> on<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> side<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of that picture on the side of the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040 
of that picture on the side of the
packaging<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> nice<00:00:32.099> picture<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
packaging you do have a nice picture of

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
packaging you do have a nice picture of
antivenom<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:37.489> i'm<00:00:38.489> wondering<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:38.969> that's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
antivenom and i'm wondering if that's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.940 
antivenom and i'm wondering if that's
actually<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> actual<00:00:40.140> comic<00:00:40.559> strip<00:00:40.770> I'm

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
actually from the actual comic strip I'm

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.580 
actually from the actual comic strip I'm
assuming<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
assuming it might be so on the back here

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
assuming it might be so on the back here

with<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.280> nice<00:01:14.490> base<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> let<00:01:15.659> me

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
with this very nice base here and let me

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
with this very nice base here and let me
go<00:01:15.810> ahead<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.020> set<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> figure<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> back

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
go ahead and set the figure to the back

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
go ahead and set the figure to the back
here<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.189> we'll<00:01:20.189> take<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> look<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> base

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
here and we'll take a look at the base

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.780 
here and we'll take a look at the base
very<00:01:21.979> nicely<00:01:22.979> detailed<00:01:23.420> these<00:01:24.420> pieces<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.790> 1

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
very nicely detailed these pieces here 1

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
very nicely detailed these pieces here 1
2<00:01:27.330> &amp;<00:01:27.570> 3<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:29.070> separate<00:01:29.400> pieces

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
2 &amp; 3 are all actually separate pieces

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
2 &amp; 3 are all actually separate pieces
they<00:01:29.790> come<00:01:29.939> packaged<00:01:30.329> separately<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
they come packaged separately and it's a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.539 
they come packaged separately and it's a
pretty<00:01:32.159> nice-looking<00:01:32.369> base<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.369> see

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
pretty nice-looking base you can see

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
pretty nice-looking base you can see
down<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:37.549> got<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.579> pigs<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.750> don't

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
down there got some pigs you don't

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
down there got some pigs you don't
really<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.189> pigs<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
really have to use the pigs but you can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.469 
really have to use the pigs but you can
-<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.229> securely<00:01:43.820> attach<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> figure<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
- more securely attach the figure to the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.980 
- more securely attach the figure to the
base<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.689> look<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
base so there's that now look at the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.280 
base so there's that now look at the
back<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.210> let's<00:01:51.659> take<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> look<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
back here and let's take a look at the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
back here and let's take a look at the
figure<00:01:52.560> itself<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.520> thing<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> note

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
figure itself now one thing to note

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.569 
figure itself now one thing to note
about<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.420> figure<00:01:55.040> based<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.250> its<00:01:56.399> design

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
about this figure based on its design

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.740 
about this figure based on its design
the<00:01:57.509> actual<00:01:57.810> figure<00:01:58.079> itself<00:01:58.380> has<00:01:58.649> these

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the actual figure itself has these

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
the actual figure itself has these
points<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.990> throughout<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> figure<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
points here throughout the figure and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.600 
points here throughout the figure and
they<00:02:02.579> are<00:02:02.729> sharp<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> mean<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> actually

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
they are sharp I mean they can actually

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.039 
they are sharp I mean they can actually
there's<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> definitely<00:02:06.630> feel<00:02:06.810> them

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
there's you can definitely feel them

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
there's you can definitely feel them
they're<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.829> sharp<00:02:08.069> enough<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> really

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
they're not sharp enough to really

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.089 
they're not sharp enough to really
pierce<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> skin<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pierce the skin but you know you kind of

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.530 
pierce the skin but you know you kind of
poke<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.430> finger<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.940> kind<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> makes<00:02:12.360> a

poke your finger and it kind of makes a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.640 
poke your finger and it kind of makes a
little

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
little

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
little
Indian<00:02:14.099> there<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.530> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
Indian there if you can see that so you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.460 
Indian there if you can see that so you
have<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.069> careful<00:02:18.079> you<00:02:19.079> can<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.349> they're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
have to be careful you can see they're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.619 
have to be careful you can see they're
made<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.799> little<00:02:20.010> Indian<00:02:20.430> my<00:02:20.730> my<00:02:21.329> finger

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
made of a little Indian my my finger

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.229 
made of a little Indian my my finger
there<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.739> pretty<00:02:22.980> uh<00:02:23.040> pretty<00:02:23.640> pokey

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
there so they are pretty uh pretty pokey

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.449 
there so they are pretty uh pretty pokey
pretty<00:02:24.480> prickly<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.860> look<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.250> figure

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
pretty prickly but I look at the figure

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.460 
pretty prickly but I look at the figure
itself<00:02:26.549> starting<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.269> head<00:02:27.470> really

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
itself starting with the head really

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:37.580 
itself starting with the head really
cool<00:02:35.510> not<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> whole<00:02:36.720> lot<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> say<00:02:37.109> about<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.470> but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
cool not a whole lot to say about it but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.069 
cool not a whole lot to say about it but
it<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.739> nice<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.579> what<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.930> being

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
it is nice for what it is you know being

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.190 
it is nice for what it is you know being
a<00:02:40.260> symbiote<00:02:40.829> costume<00:02:41.959> articulation<00:02:42.959> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
a symbiote costume articulation is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.890 
a symbiote costume articulation is
fairly<00:02:43.470> basic<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.310> know<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.900> Marvel

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
fairly basic and as you know that Marvel

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.839 
fairly basic and as you know that Marvel
Select<00:02:46.049> figures<00:02:46.409> tend<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.769> have<00:02:46.920> less<00:02:47.250> points

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
Select figures tend to have less points

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.780 
Select figures tend to have less points
of<00:02:47.970> articulation<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.750> let's<00:02:49.500> say<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:50.069> Marvel

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
of articulation then let's say a Marvel

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.599 
of articulation then let's say a Marvel
Universe<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.420> Marvel<00:02:51.810> Legends<00:02:52.109> figure<00:02:52.609> but

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
Universe or a Marvel Legends figure but

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.610 
Universe or a Marvel Legends figure but
there<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.849> articulation<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.629> head<00:02:54.810> pretty

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
there is articulation at the head pretty

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.289 
there is articulation at the head pretty
much<00:02:55.799> side-to-side<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.459> can't<00:02:56.819> seem<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> really

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
much side-to-side I can't seem to really

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.319 
much side-to-side I can't seem to really
get<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.780> figure<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.260> look<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.700> want<00:02:59.879> more<00:03:00.120> up

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
get the figure to look you want more up

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.179 
get the figure to look you want more up
or<00:03:00.510> down<00:03:00.689> there's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.260> joint<00:03:01.650> there<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:01.980> looks

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
or down there's a joint there you looks

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.610 
or down there's a joint there you looks
like<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.609> probably<00:03:02.939> do<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
like you can probably do that if you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.849 
like you can probably do that if you
don't<00:03:04.709> poke<00:03:05.220> your<00:03:05.310> fingers<00:03:05.579> too<00:03:05.700> much<00:03:05.849> but

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
don't poke your fingers too much but

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.690 
don't poke your fingers too much but
looks<00:03:07.859> like<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.099> doesn't<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.609> go

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
looks like it doesn't really want to go

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.539 
looks like it doesn't really want to go
down<00:03:08.870> farther<00:03:09.870> all<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.010> way<00:03:11.099> around<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.489> the

down farther all the way around with the
shoulders<00:03:11.879> out<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.689> that<00:03:12.810> degree<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.409> side

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620

at the elbow swivel at the wrist and you

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.050 
at the elbow swivel at the wrist and you
got<00:03:23.639> some<00:03:23.849> really<00:03:24.030> large<00:03:24.359> hands<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:26.060> really

cool
there's<00:03:29.430> no<00:03:29.609> AB<00:03:29.819> articulation<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.629> do<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
there's no AB articulation you do have a

swivel cut at the waist the legs you
have<00:03:34.980> articulation<00:03:35.989> just<00:03:37.159> like<00:03:38.159> that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
have articulation just like that

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.599 
have articulation just like that
you<00:03:40.290> can<00:03:40.440> probably<00:03:40.560> rotate<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.190> ball<00:03:41.400> here

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
you can probably rotate this ball here

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.759 
you can probably rotate this ball here
but<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.849> pretty<00:03:41.909> pretty<00:03:42.510> stiff<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.620> see

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
but it's pretty pretty stiff you can see

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.050 
but it's pretty pretty stiff you can see
there<00:03:43.919> gently<00:03:44.099> there<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.400> there's<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.579> swivel

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
there gently there and there's a swivel

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.659 
there gently there and there's a swivel
f25<00:03:45.479> a<00:03:45.769> single<00:03:46.769> point<00:03:46.949> of<00:03:47.010> articulation<00:03:47.220> at

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
f25 a single point of articulation at

f25 a single point of articulation at
the<00:03:47.760> at<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> knee<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.739> at<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.220> ankles<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.849> not

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
the at the knee and at the ankles so not

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.559 
the at the knee and at the ankles so not
too<00:03:54.000> bad<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:55.729> actually<00:03:56.729> saw<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.150> figure<00:03:57.329> cover

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
too bad I actually saw this figure cover

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.449 
too bad I actually saw this figure cover
a<00:03:57.629> couple<00:03:57.900> times<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.319> passes<00:03:58.680> up<00:03:58.829> but<00:03:59.069> I'm

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
a couple times I passes up but I'm

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.759 
a couple times I passes up but I'm
really<00:03:59.669> a<00:03:59.790> fan<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.389> venom<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.019> all<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
really a fan of the venom and all the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
really a fan of the venom and all the
variations<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> symbiote<00:04:02.909> with<00:04:03.359> carnage

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
variations with a symbiote with carnage

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.599 
variations with a symbiote with carnage
and<00:04:04.019> toxin<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.799> forth

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
and toxin and so forth

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.479 
and toxin and so forth
so<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.060> do<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:07.379> particular<00:04:08.010> character

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
so I do like this particular character

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.300 
so I do like this particular character
it's<00:04:09.239> funny<00:04:09.510> though<00:04:09.659> because<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:10.500> stopped

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
it's funny though because I stopped

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.629 
it's funny though because I stopped
reading<00:04:11.519> comics<00:04:12.090> about<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.979> about<00:04:13.979> 1993

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
reading comics about in the about 1993
