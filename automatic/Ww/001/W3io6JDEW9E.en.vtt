00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 welcome once again here to my house and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.460
 as a routine let's start giving them 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
 recommendations of how they can do 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.360
 homemade things that can benefit them 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.669
 to your skin and this morning we're going to do 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.830
 a mud mask and I'm going to 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.869
 also count all those benefits that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 They can take you to your skin so 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.790
 come with me to teach them all the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.530
 process to remove the kitchen and many 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 of things and having more caries we had 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 You guys, I like them to be 100% 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 natural because I think it brings 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.190
 a lot more benefits to our skin 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.899
 for being purely natural so this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.629
 tomorrow we are going to talk about all those 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.610
 miraculous benefits that the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 mud towards our face 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 specifically let's talk right now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.690
 so the materials that we're going to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 need this morning are 6 teaspoons 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 of mud mask powder 2 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.930
 teaspoons of almond oil and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.509
 of course our utensils for the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 cleaning is that a sponge and a towel 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.119
 to zoom in 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.790
 first what of course we have to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.920
 to do is to clean our our 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.810
 so I always recommend washcloth 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.630
 wet in this case I have these 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.280
 wet wipes that are cucumber that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.620
 It also helps to refresh the face to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.620
 so we can prepare them to be more 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.870
 the body 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.760
 and many of us may have to 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.860
 in certain periods of our 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.990
 menstruation should come out a little bit 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 granite then the most that helps 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 desinflamar all that goes rite and also 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 a good antiseptic tool is 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.660
 say you are going to see in the process that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.820
 let's start with the mask 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.250
 quite wet and then dry 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
 then when drying what it does absorb 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.320
 all the toxins in our face 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.940
 apart from a myriad of benefits like that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 let's start with the part of the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.950
 preparation of the mask 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.700
 we started we added the 6 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.700
 teaspoons 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.080
 It is recommended that materials be used 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.470
 of glass and plastic because according to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.930
 they comment on doing the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.170
 combination between earth and metal 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.180
 the metal absorbs some of the benefit 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 of the earth so that's why it's better to 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.460
 recommends that it be done only with 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.350
 plastic or glass materials 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.440
 and the almond oil what helps him 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.470
 is that 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
 help the rejuvenation part of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.390
 the skin 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.700
 we already added the tablespoons of the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.200
 clay and also from the socially but 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.690
 you can not escape the part of the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.970
 water so that we can elaborate what 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.870
 what is the paste but the water is going 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.910
 throwing little by little so that we do not 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 is not so watery or is it so hard 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.570
 remember that the almond oil 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.060
 It also helped a lot for the part of 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.830
 rejuvenation then if we do not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.870
 we want to see even younger so I 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.000
 I make the recommendation that is made 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.160
 this combination between the oil the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.030
 almond and also the mask of 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.240
 mud 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.700
 Many also mention that the car is 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.830
 great for the part of cellulite 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.870
 of the legs but this we're going to 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.900
 do in other segments to see in 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.300
 what are those results that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.069
 can bring mud to our skin 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.930
 many people mention the miraculous 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.940
 they are and actually I have had the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.060
 opportunity to check it and how I have 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.680
 there is a small one of granites then by 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 that I wanted to give this recommendation for 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.970
 that you also see a little bit how 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.730
 is the difference of our face a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.170
 Once we apply the mask then 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.290
 there is already the pasta 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.110
 well elaborated and it 's time for the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.760
 apply this as I insist you 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.099
 recommends that they be applied with these 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.900
 fingers and that it be circular to 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.630
 so that our pores can also 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.760
 acquire and absorb all the benefits 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 both mud and oil so 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.750
 apply it is part of the main 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.760
 mud nutrients are calcium the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.680
 silica that helps the elasticity of the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.080
 skin and magnesium which is a tonic 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.610
 general vitalizer and regenerator 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.610
 cellular and antiseptic 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.139
 but we just finished 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.020
 many people we forget so much about 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.210
 the lips as of the neck is mentioned 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.740
 that in the neck one can 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.629
 identify a person's age 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 then while we take care 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.590
 our face on our lip and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.330
 our body adding this kind of 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.669
 masks we're going to make our 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.740
 youth last a lot longer now we go 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.990
 to wait about 15 minutes until the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.509
 Mask is completely dry for 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.150
 then wash so I had a rest 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:17.310
 Meanwhile little recipe read this 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.680
 mask the mud stimulates the system 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.779
 immunological and through it penetrates 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.909
 in the bloodstream providing 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.099
 essential micronutrients for 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.689
 biological functions of the organism is a 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.729
 great revitalizing of the skin and 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.250
 cells providing elements that 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.689
 stimulate your natural defenses 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.610
 thus contributing to reinforce our 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.770
 immune system thanks to their 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.479
 many minerals not only contributes to 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.250
 the natural defenses of the skin itself 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.689
 but they also provide the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.930
 cell some essential nutrients 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.219
 to heal damaged tissues 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.639
 favoring its reproduction and 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.889
 regeneration 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.270
 as they saw the mud has a number 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.120
 of benefits I can talk a lot 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.819
 because we are core and makes the skin 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.580
 it tenses everything so it's time now 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.069
 to move all these masks to 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.280
 so we can talk about the spectacular is 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.200
 the skin was left 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.780
 I told them at the beginning of the program 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.820
 on this sponge I discovered the good 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.430
 who cleaned the face of the 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.490
 masks with this because this damage to 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.169
 less the skin and it also helps you 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.240
 at the moment that you are withdrawing 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:38.460
 Masks is also exfoliating 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:40.200
 so let's use the sponge a 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.540
 I just finished the mask they saw 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.580
 that I did not make so much disaster because 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.320
 I was using them with these facts 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.910
 I recommend them a lot also is the 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.070
 precision of a lot more which 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.900
 much more rejuvenated too 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.930
 because we have the opportunity to 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.880
 eliminate all that toxin so I hope 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.130
 that you can not use this 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.650
 homemade recipe to get a 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.320
 more refreshing skin through the 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.540
 mud mask and also with some 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.740
 droplets Friday so I can not the 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.740
 next I think 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.640
 d
