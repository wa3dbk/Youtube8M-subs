 Well, sit and class 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.040

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.070
 Difficult would you have me diversity 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.759

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.800
 general revival in the hall this humor and not 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.360

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.719
 sales do not know how 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.809

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.330
 I will certainly know how to live 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.520
 knit and knit u knit well 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.350
 let's go for a minute for example 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.250
 He comes to the doctor a sick patient 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.250
 bandaged leg 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.120
 what hurts you asks about head 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:01:01.460
 celebrate pretty 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:05.089
 but why didn't the bandage on her leg slip 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.890
 persuade here humor if a person 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.999
 hurts his head fuck him to tie 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.909
 leg not tied but he tied his head 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:22.359
 meanwhile the bandage seemed on foot 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:24.360
 spasm get out of here 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.060
 nonsense already 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.400
 I have something I can not grasp this layer 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.470
 anecdote you may have let 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.230
 any detail what detail well 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.260
 for example, that the patient was one-legged 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.870
 why , why not? 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.790
 that bandage really slid channel 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.330
 sliding over the whole body then was 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.190
 grab 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.460
 both of them had two legs, for sure it was 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.350
 one legged disabled person no it was not 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.550
 for example the bandage seemed on one leg 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.160
 I slipped better if you don't have me 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.610
 questions here question sick what 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.500
 head such a fairy tale could not well 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:23.370
 witty by chance this is not a series of answers 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.100
 Armenian radio is that you can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.350
 Virgo the Internet is not the last time 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.350
 I ask the patient what was sick 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:46.840
 further slipped because of this anecdote 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
 enclave clung 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.190
 dismissal threatens to be necessary with him 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.080
 talk seriously but what sidor 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.680
 go quietly work everything will be in 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.590

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:07.150
 even though you tell us a secret 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 did the patient still hurt
