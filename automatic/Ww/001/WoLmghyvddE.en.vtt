years<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.640> developed<00:00:53.760> something<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.510> was

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
years we developed something that was

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.590 
years we developed something that was
scalable<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.149> capable

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
scalable and that was that was capable

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
scalable and that was that was capable
of<00:00:57.870> becoming<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.590> fund<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.210> launched

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
of becoming a fund and so we launched

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.590 
of becoming a fund and so we launched
the<00:01:00.660> fund<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.140> February<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> last<00:01:01.920> year<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the fund in February of last year and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.969

here we are today and you start by

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.140 
here we are today and you start by
telling<00:01:05.010> us<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.090> what

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
telling us a little bit more about what

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
telling us a little bit more about what
a<00:01:06.360> hedge<00:01:06.540> fund<00:01:06.630> isn't<00:01:06.990> how<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> works<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
a hedge fund isn't how it works the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.929 
a hedge fund isn't how it works the
difference<00:01:08.010> between<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.250> hedge<00:01:08.430> fund<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
difference between a hedge fund and a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
difference between a hedge fund and a
traditional<00:01:09.390> investment<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.110> index

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
traditional investment like an index

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.840 
traditional investment like an index
fund<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> mutual<00:01:11.189> fund<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> hedge

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
fund or a mutual fund is that hedge

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.690 
fund or a mutual fund is that hedge
funds<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.840> latitude<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.680> manage<00:01:14.490> risk

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
funds have more latitude to manage risk

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
funds have more latitude to manage risk
for<00:01:14.880> clients<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> means<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> an

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for clients so what that means is an

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
for clients so what that means is an
environment<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.670> hedge<00:01:18.150> funds<00:01:18.479> can

environment like this hedge funds can

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
environment like this hedge funds can
use<00:01:18.990> derivatives<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.890> futures<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.939> reduce

how do you build trust with people we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
how do you build trust with people we
build<00:01:34.560> trust<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.610> explaining<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
build trust I think by explaining and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
build trust I think by explaining and
trying<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.650> clear<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
trying to be very clear about what it is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
trying to be very clear about what it is
that<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> people<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that we do a lot of people in the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
that we do a lot of people in the
general<00:01:40.650> public<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
general public are you think of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.870 
general public are you think of
investing<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.829> rocket<00:01:44.189> science<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
investing as rocket science and it's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
investing as rocket science and it's
really<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.500> try<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
really not and so what we try to do is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
really not and so what we try to do is
bring<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.399> home<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.479> things<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
bring it home and put the things that we

ninety-five percent of the public if you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.310 
ninety-five percent of the public if you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
were to show a stock chart let's say to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.170 
were to show a stock chart let's say to
an<00:02:19.410> individual<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.190> showed<00:02:20.400> let's<00:02:21.090> say

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
an individual and you showed let's say

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
an individual and you showed let's say
you<00:02:21.270> showed<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.600> stock<00:02:21.840> charts<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.680> you

you showed to stock charts one you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.370 
you showed to stock charts one you
showed<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> stock<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:24.090> up<00:02:24.450> let's<00:02:24.930> say<00:02:25.050> Apple

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
showed a stock going up let's say Apple

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.990 
showed a stock going up let's say Apple
computer<00:02:25.740> from<00:02:25.950> ten<00:02:26.250> dollars<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.730> fifty

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
computer from ten dollars to fifty

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.270 
computer from ten dollars to fifty
dollars<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.690> earlier<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> decade

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
dollars I think earlier in the decade

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.090 
dollars I think earlier in the decade
and<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.840> stock<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.320> went<00:02:31.410> from<00:02:31.560> fifty<00:02:31.890> dollars

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and a stock that went from fifty dollars

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
and a stock that went from fifty dollars
to<00:02:32.220> ten<00:02:32.370> dollars<00:02:32.640> well<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.210> majority<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
to ten dollars well the majority of the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.570 
to ten dollars well the majority of the
investment<00:02:34.170> public<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:34.590> say<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.400> they're

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
investment public would say that they're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
investment public would say that they're
more<00:02:35.760> interested<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.330> buying<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.720> stock<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
more interested in buying the stock that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.130 
more interested in buying the stock that
went<00:02:37.230> from<00:02:37.350> 50<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.740> 10<00:02:38.390> what<00:02:39.390> we're<00:02:39.570> saying<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
went from 50 to 10 what we're saying and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.310 
went from 50 to 10 what we're saying and
what<00:02:40.830> our<00:02:41.010> empirical<00:02:41.550> research<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.300> proven<00:02:43.050> is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
what our empirical research is proven is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.949 
what our empirical research is proven is
that<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.310> stock<00:02:44.550> that's<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.480> likely

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
that the stock that's going up is likely

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.570 
that the stock that's going up is likely
to<00:02:45.990> continue<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.740> an<00:02:46.920> object<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.550> motion

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to continue going on an object in motion

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
to continue going on an object in motion
is<00:02:47.970> likely<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.330> stay<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.600> motion<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.020> exists

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
is likely to stay in motion that exists

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.310 
is likely to stay in motion that exists
in<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.530> market<00:02:49.830> too<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.750> focus<00:02:52.200> on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
in the market too and so we focus on

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.420 
in the market too and so we focus on
opportunities<00:02:52.890> where<00:02:53.070> things<00:02:53.280> are

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
opportunities where things are

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.730 
opportunities where things are
performing<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.080> likelihood<00:02:55.590> is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
performing because the likelihood is

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.710 
performing because the likelihood is
that<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.580> future<00:02:56.700> those<00:02:57.090> same<00:02:57.390> things

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
that in the future those same things

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.960 
that in the future those same things
will<00:02:58.050> continue<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> perform<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.070> what<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.820> do

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
will continue to perform and what we do

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.270 
will continue to perform and what we do
is<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.300> focus<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.810> limiting<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.470> losses<00:03:02.010> on

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
is we focus on limiting the losses on

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.640 
is we focus on limiting the losses on
the<00:03:02.580> ventures<00:03:02.940> where<00:03:03.150> we're<00:03:03.540> wrong<00:03:03.750> we're

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the ventures where we're wrong we're

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
the ventures where we're wrong we're

there<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.560> two<00:03:16.709> main<00:03:17.160> reasons<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.820> one

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
there are two main reasons for that one

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.250 
there are two main reasons for that one
is<00:03:18.860> diversification<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:21.360> second<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.900> risk

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
is diversification the second is risk

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.600 
is diversification the second is risk
management<00:03:22.739> let's<00:03:23.400> start<00:03:23.459> with

management let's start with

management let's start with
diversification<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.450> best<00:03:24.660> antidote<00:03:25.019> for<00:03:25.709> an

diversification the best antidote for an

efficient portfolio is broad

efficient portfolio is broad
diversification<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.239> think<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.110> fund

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
diversification if you think of the fund

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.210 
diversification if you think of the fund
as<00:03:31.769> an<00:03:32.519> airplane<00:03:33.320> then<00:03:34.320> diversification

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
as an airplane then diversification
