okay<00:00:01.469> so<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:02.040> we<00:00:02.190> have<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.760> Leica<00:00:03.600> m6<00:00:04.410> TTL

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay so here we have the Leica m6 TTL

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.650 
okay so here we have the Leica m6 TTL
this<00:00:06.420> model<00:00:06.990> was<00:00:07.259> actually<00:00:07.670> in<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.300> final

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
this model was actually in the final

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.980 
this model was actually in the final
year<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.080> was<00:00:10.200> made<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:11.940> made<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.300> 1999

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
year it was made so it was made in 1999

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.900 
year it was made so it was made in 1999
and<00:00:13.880> it's<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> point<00:00:15.660> eight<00:00:15.870> five

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
and it's got a point eight five

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
and it's got a point eight five
magnification<00:00:17.910> viewfinder<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
magnification viewfinder which is the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.779 
magnification viewfinder which is the
highest<00:00:20.369> magnification<00:00:21.350> since<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:23.189> original

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
highest magnification since the original

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
highest magnification since the original
like<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> m3<00:00:24.930> m3

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
like a m3 m3

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.820 
like a m3 m3
was<00:00:26.189> actually<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> first<00:00:27.289> like<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.439> M<00:00:28.560> body

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
was actually the first like an M body

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.450 
was actually the first like an M body
followed<00:00:29.820> by<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
followed by the two one and then the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.910 
followed by the two one and then the
four<00:00:33.649> 4<00:00:34.649> 2<00:00:34.860> 4<00:00:35.219> P<00:00:35.550> 5<00:00:37.460> m6<00:00:38.460> classic<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> TTL<00:00:40.410> then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
four 4 2 4 P 5 m6 classic the TTL then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580 
four 4 2 4 P 5 m6 classic the TTL then
the<00:00:41.129> 7<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.420> final<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the 7 and then the final one which is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
the 7 and then the final one which is
the<00:00:43.770> MP<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.829> this<00:00:46.829> particular<00:00:47.430> guy<00:00:47.579> differs

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the MP and this particular guy differs

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.470 
the MP and this particular guy differs
from<00:00:48.510> its<00:00:48.809> m6<00:00:49.469> counterpart<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
from its m6 counterpart because the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
from its m6 counterpart because the
shutter<00:00:51.780> speed<00:00:51.989> dial<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.620> significantly

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
shutter speed dial is significantly

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
shutter speed dial is significantly
larger<00:00:54.120> making<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.600> easier<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.440> finger

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
larger making it easier for your finger

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
larger making it easier for your finger
to<00:00:56.129> reach<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> correct

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to reach over and turn it to the correct

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.459 
to reach over and turn it to the correct
shutter<00:00:58.649> speed<00:00:58.980> which<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.640> like

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
shutter speed which you would like

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
shutter speed which you would like
another<00:01:01.469> added<00:01:01.829> benefit<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.280> metering<00:01:02.969> with

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
another added benefit is metering with

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
another added benefit is metering with
the<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.080> flash<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.619> indicated<00:01:05.129> through

this camera like all like embodies is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.929 
this camera like all like embodies is
very<00:01:12.540> solid<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.220> definitely<00:01:14.400> feel<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
very solid you can definitely feel the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
very solid you can definitely feel the
weight<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:16.170> camera<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.549> large<00:01:17.820> at

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
weight the camera is not very large at

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.340 
weight the camera is not very large at
all<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.920> as<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> matter<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> fact<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> see

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
all and as a matter of fact you can see

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
all and as a matter of fact you can see
here<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> normal<00:01:24.210> pen<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
here this is the just a normal pen and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.710 
here this is the just a normal pen and
the<00:01:25.740> camera<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.970> bigger<00:01:27.330> than

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the camera is not very much bigger than

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
the camera is not very much bigger than
the<00:01:27.869> pen<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:31.409> quite<00:01:31.619> small<00:01:34.520> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the pen here it's quite small and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
the pen here it's quite small and
because<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.360> design<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> rangefinder

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
because of the design of the rangefinder

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
because of the design of the rangefinder
body<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.700> allows<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.900> smaller<00:01:39.930> lenses

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
body it allows for much smaller lenses

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
body it allows for much smaller lenses
here<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> version<00:01:42.060> 3<00:01:42.540> zoom<00:01:42.810> Ekron<00:01:43.140> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
here we have a version 3 zoom Ekron it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
here we have a version 3 zoom Ekron it's
a<00:01:43.829> 15<00:01:44.220> millimeter<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> prime

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
a 15 millimeter with the it's a prime

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.710 
a 15 millimeter with the it's a prime
lens<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.970> maximum<00:01:48.270> aperture<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:49.340> f2<00:01:50.340> as

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
lens and the maximum aperture is f2 as

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
lens and the maximum aperture is f2 as
indicated<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> we're<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> go

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
indicated here so we're going to go

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.840 
indicated here so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.600> mount<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.710> lens<00:01:56.189> onto<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> body

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
ahead and mount the lens onto the body

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.190 
ahead and mount the lens onto the body
so<00:01:57.590> remove<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> lens<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> body<00:02:00.299> Kemp<00:02:00.649> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
so remove the lens the body Kemp and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
so remove the lens the body Kemp and
before<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> lens<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> point

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
before I put on the lens I want to point

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
before I put on the lens I want to point
out<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> rangefinder

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
out that this is the rangefinder

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.139 
out that this is the rangefinder
coupling<00:02:08.759> arm

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
coupling arm

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.010 
coupling arm
so<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.410> the

contact with the arm and this is how the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.100 
contact with the arm and this is how the
rangefinder<00:02:27.550> focuses<00:02:28.550> along<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.690> this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
rangefinder focuses along with this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.630 
rangefinder focuses along with this
little<00:02:30.320> guy<00:02:30.560> here<00:02:30.860> there's<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.310> bunch<00:02:31.550> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
little guy here there's a bunch of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.850 
little guy here there's a bunch of
mirrors<00:02:32.030> actually<00:02:32.270> inside<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.290> overlay<00:02:33.830> the

focusing patch in what you see here so
now<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.000> lens<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.390> mounted<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.650> see

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
now that the lens is mounted you can see

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.730 
now that the lens is mounted you can see
that<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.220> total<00:02:40.460> body<00:02:40.880> size<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.740> really

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
that the total body size is just really

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.020 
that the total body size is just really
really<00:02:43.100> small<00:02:43.460> and<00:02:43.700> compact<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:46.550> little<00:02:46.850> arm

really small and compact this little arm
here<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:49.690> changing<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.260> frame<00:02:51.590> lines<00:02:51.800> but

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
here is for changing the frame lines but

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.240 
here is for changing the frame lines but
as<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.150> as<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.780> might<00:02:53.930> have<00:02:54.080> noticed<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:55.220> I

as you as you might have noticed when I
put<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> lens<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.920> arm<00:03:01.670> will<00:03:02.360> actually

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
put on the lens the arm will actually

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.670 
put on the lens the arm will actually
hop<00:03:04.160> into<00:03:05.030> place<00:03:05.420> by<00:03:05.750> itself<00:03:06.080> as<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.530> saw

is where you set the film speed their

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.580 
is where you set the film speed their
ISO<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:34.960> let<00:03:35.960> me<00:03:36.020> give<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> demonstration

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
ISO and let me give you a demonstration

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.980 
ISO and let me give you a demonstration
of<00:03:37.130> how<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.340> would<00:03:37.550> load<00:03:37.790> film<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.510> simply

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
of how you would load film so you simply

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.290 
of how you would load film so you simply
take<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.680> camera<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:41.710> open<00:03:42.710> the<00:03:43.300> bottom

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
take the camera and open the bottom

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.280 
take the camera and open the bottom
compartment<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:46.630> open<00:03:47.630> up<00:03:47.960> this

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
compartment and you can open up this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.660 
compartment and you can open up this
back<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:51.170> would<00:03:51.350> load<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.770> film<00:03:52.160> here<00:03:52.490> as

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
back you would load the film here as

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.660 
back you would load the film here as
indicated<00:03:53.180> by<00:03:53.210> the<00:03:53.330> graphic<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.580> pull<00:03:55.580> the

indicated by the graphic and pull the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:04.360 
indicated by the graphic and pull the
film<00:03:55.880> across<00:03:56.440> close<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.590> door<00:03:59.410> replace<00:04:03.370> and

film across close the door replace and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.890 
film across close the door replace and
close<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:06.230> would<00:04:06.350> advance<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.830> film

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.860 

twice<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.490> it'll<00:04:13.490> indicate<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:14.510> you're<00:04:14.750> on

zero and you're ready to go just want to
show<00:04:19.760> you<00:04:19.820> how<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.330> cloth<00:04:21.049> shutter<00:04:21.500> works

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
show you how the cloth shutter works

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.100 
show you how the cloth shutter works
here

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
here

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.130 
here
and<00:04:25.370> if<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:26.520> put<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.790> at<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.880> slower<00:04:27.390> speed<00:04:27.540> you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and if we put it at a slower speed you

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.860 
and if we put it at a slower speed you
get<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.470> see<00:04:29.480> this<00:04:30.480> how<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:30.960> works<00:04:32.720> one<00:04:33.720> more

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
get to see this how it works one more

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
get to see this how it works one more
time<00:04:34.880> cloth<00:04:35.880> shutter<00:04:36.800> wind<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.980> slowly<00:04:38.250> there

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
time cloth shutter wind it slowly there

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.110 
time cloth shutter wind it slowly there
we<00:04:39.330> go<00:04:39.920> one<00:04:40.920> second<00:04:41.340> exposure<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.500> on<00:04:44.160> higher

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
we go one second exposure so on higher

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.880 
we go one second exposure so on higher
shutter<00:04:45.450> speeds<00:04:45.840> for<00:04:46.200> instance<00:04:46.500> like<00:04:46.680> five

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
shutter speeds for instance like five

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.850 
shutter speeds for instance like five
hundred<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:48.030> camera<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.750> just<00:04:48.780> very<00:04:49.530> very
