very<00:01:48.149> long<00:01:48.389> you<00:01:48.749> can<00:01:48.899> imagine<00:01:49.109> if<00:01:49.409> their<00:01:49.560> work

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
very long you can imagine if their work

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.529 
very long you can imagine if their work
land<00:01:49.920> troops<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.609> those<00:01:50.999> Giants<00:01:51.420> would

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
land troops in there those Giants would

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.419 
land troops in there those Giants would
have<00:01:51.659> been<00:01:51.840> dead<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> long<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.499> ago<00:01:52.859> so

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
have been dead a long time ago so

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.340 
have been dead a long time ago so
despite<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> lack<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> traps<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.139> lack<00:01:55.319> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
despite the lack of traps and lack of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.819 
these goblins here they go to break into
the<00:03:21.700> central<00:03:22.150> compartment<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.470> turns<00:03:23.500> out

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
the central compartment now it turns out

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.589 
the central compartment now it turns out
i<00:03:23.890> didn't<00:03:24.250> even<00:03:24.489> need<00:03:24.610> my<00:03:24.790> king<00:03:25.060> for<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.390> so

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
i didn't even need my king for this so

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.030 
i didn't even need my king for this so
it<00:03:25.750> was<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> bit<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.230> waste<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.590> time<00:03:26.650> me

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
it was a bit of a waste of time me

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920 
it was a bit of a waste of time me
dropping<00:03:27.280> him<00:03:27.519> down<00:03:27.790> bit<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.329> a<00:03:28.480> waste<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
dropping him down bit of a waste of a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.809 
dropping him down bit of a waste of a
king<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> then<00:03:29.769> decided<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.310> try<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.670> heal

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
king so I then decided to try and heal

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.880 
king so I then decided to try and heal
him<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.599> could<00:03:31.660> quit<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.620> him<00:03:32.739> on

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
him so that I could quit with him on

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.380 
him so that I could quit with him on
full<00:03:33.160> health<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.790> wasn't<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.299> to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
full health but that wasn't going to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.780 
full health but that wasn't going to
happen<00:03:34.480> he<00:03:35.470> was<00:03:35.590> being<00:03:35.799> fired<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.250> by<00:03:36.430> too<00:03:36.489> many

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
happen he was being fired on by too many

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.360 
happen he was being fired on by too many
defenses<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.799> unfortunately<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.859> lost<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
defenses and unfortunately I lost the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.090 
defenses and unfortunately I lost the
king<00:03:39.579> so<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.600> attack<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.440> see

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.039 
king so we see this attack out and see
how<00:03:42.340> much<00:03:42.579> stuff<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:42.910> could<00:03:43.209> actually<00:03:43.389> get<00:03:43.810> now

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
how much stuff we could actually get now

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.539 
how much stuff we could actually get now
what<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.500> found<00:03:44.769> with<00:03:45.010> these<00:03:45.190> attacks

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
what I have found with these attacks

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.759 
what I have found with these attacks
especially<00:03:45.940> when<00:03:46.389> using<00:03:46.630> king<00:03:47.079> giants<00:03:47.650> and

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
especially when using king giants and

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.460 
especially when using king giants and
healers<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.180> good<00:03:49.329> idea<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:50.139> take<00:03:50.290> at

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
healers it's a good idea to take at

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.979 
healers it's a good idea to take at
least<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:50.950> wizard<00:03:51.250> two<00:03:52.209> or<00:03:52.359> three<00:03:52.600> usually

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
least one wizard two or three usually

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.660 
least one wizard two or three usually
does<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.319> job<00:03:53.500> because<00:03:54.010> they'll<00:03:54.220> take<00:03:54.489> them

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
does the job because they'll take them

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670 
does the job because they'll take them
or<00:03:54.819> two<00:03:54.970> hits<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.389> your<00:03:55.870> healer<00:03:56.109> will<00:03:56.319> heal<00:03:56.530> up

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
or two hits and your healer will heal up

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.379 
or two hits and your healer will heal up
your<00:03:56.859> wizard<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.519> bit<00:03:57.639> like<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.180> does

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
