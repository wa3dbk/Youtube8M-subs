00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.030
 hello welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.640
 game that we are going to launch in the month of 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.920
 July is the first game of thumbnails 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 we deal in my game Month 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.490
 we had the opportunity so far 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.040
 to deal with other collectables like 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.710
 is this great world that we have for 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.200
 this month so champion allies such let 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.610
 united is not just a game that appeared 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.489
 in the chiqui starter in the hand of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 martÃ­n manti manti keys that comes a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 little people who were on xbox or piano 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.670
 today he has made a similar company 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.590
 parallel they have several games one of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 they very much resemble warhammer or once 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.840
 that works in warhammer 40,000 that 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.910
 call the zone we have one more game and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 they took out this clover as a kind of 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.320
 variation of the mythical and famous black ball 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.450
 the american football game in the world 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.460
 of warhammer fantasy this clover is not 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.030
 so much a game of American football 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.479
 we like football a lot 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.460
 American as a game a little more 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.979
 throwing to handball is more I would say that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 He remembers a lot the famous speedball 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.640
 speedball 2 to big brothers that he had in 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.440
 the time of the 90 left I want to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 remember that among other things mega 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.110
 drive that had a lot 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.310
 and that it was a game in which two teams 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.780
 they played like a kind of handball 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.660
 with a ball that could be loaded and that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.170
 was allowed to hit or attack the opponent 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.970
 We could watch them and we could do 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.440
 a series of traps are worked that 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 they were not very well seen in the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.210
 real life sports with this one 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.740
 approach appears this clover as 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.770
 I say the shamrock appeared on kickstarter 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 funds raised exceeded with 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.960
 you grow what they needed and it came out 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.540
 this game with time have gone 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 appearing different novelties or 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.600
 different improvements 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.400
 extensions for the game also to 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 from here starter we have already three 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.060
 seasons are about to leave behind 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.759
 when we get to fourth that we add a 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.000
 lots of things equipment rules can be 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.100
 can be and we will talk more end of the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 theme of the different seasons that 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 there is a moment at some point that is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.010
 they have gone a little the pot maybe they have 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.560
 spent a little bit of what the spirit is 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.660
 original clover 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.790
 at least the base game and also the two 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.239
 first enlargements to your standing the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.920
 season 3 maybe they are something very very 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.280
 interesting and that allow two 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.840
 players in principle players 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.040
 take on this field of play and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 I say in principle because although the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.370
 third season we have raised a 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.220
 clover we'll talk about what can be 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.599
 up to six players at a time is a 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.310
 little strange but it is true that 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.480
 that the blog with we can play leagues in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.489
 the manual not only of the leagues also 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.500
 we'll talk about them how it works in the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.730
 league how can you play a league and what 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.769
 benefits has in the league that we 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 will allow players to sign 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.819
 star players and have a series of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.080
 good of improvements for our team 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.060
 as I say remember about the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.849
 approach and a little game reminds 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.030
 to the bowl a great game for some 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.650
 reason that I do not understand is maybe not 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.720
 officially discontinued but it's 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.580
 complicated to get it it seems that you have 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.330
 bone does not loose nor the rights of the blog 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.099
 bowl 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.540
 nor reissue it when people are 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.849
 asking we have a card game 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.370
 the last one is not very interesting that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.590
 we will talk also in the days but not 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.299
 it's the same as playing with the miniatures 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.140
 and as I said precisely 3 good is a 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.969
 miniatures game that provides us 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.500
 to the team players that we can 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.120
 ride and we can paint is for 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.159
 supposedly much nicer painted 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.849
 in fact you are going to see in the game that 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.409
 let's use the painted miniatures 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.939
 personally I did not know from the 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.200
 known through click friends 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.599
 n 'roll and the truth for me has been 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.239
 maybe the discovery of the year has 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.700
 It seemed like an excellent game 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.859
 I liked blood bowl a lot and this for me 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.760
 it's even better that I like the balloon 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:03.250
 more the theme of this speedball that 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.510
 which is football itself and how 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.970
 As I say, I'm a big fan of 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.120
 american football but I still like it 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.370
 more this theme of speedball 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 I have the game for two players one 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 departure is very fast work carlos 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.209
 was to carry I think one more hour or 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.500
 less and it's quite pretty intense 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.210
 we'll have to give the mole a lot to 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.370
 know when we have to perform the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.900
 actions because some actions can 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.330
 to finish our turn hastily 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.280
 and you do not have to force that situation since 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.199
 can be very good for the opponent or very 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.970
 bad for us and of course 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.910
 we have characters of various races between 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.550
 they as you see here to the always 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.850
 present orcs that his will be to give 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.770
 firewood to the rival in the first edition already 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.960
 that we will see during this month 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.610
 now that the season let's say we have 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.190
 four teams to choose from and in this box 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.560
 we had two of the orc orcs and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.210
 goblins and that of humans and we have 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.280
 two more you could choose a 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.199
 specials fit in rat shadow and some 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.850
 dwarfs later as I say have gone 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.770
 appearing more equipment than also 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.260
 we will talk about them in different 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.320
 seasons but good at the end the 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.060
 teams are similar and everyone has their 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.580
 advantages and their disadvantages your points 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.320
 strong and its weak points and what yes 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 it is true that it is very well thought 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.970
 so that we can 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.880
 play spending the least money between 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.500
 quotation marks needed to play since no 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.139
 you need to buy this basic box 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.520
 but if someone already has the box 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.110
 basic or among several we buy one 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.300
 basic box simply with buying us 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.960
 our team and some dice we have 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.880
 enough to play 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.220
 that's very well we think thank you 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.240
 the detail to the boys of thematic then 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.580
 as I say this will be the game that 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.560
 we will analyze in July without teaching 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.960
 all the components the rules we will see 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.300
 the game and at the end of the month we'll talk 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.949
 well of these new seasons and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.440
 all the extras that we have so 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.020
 less to the July date I imagine that in 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.389
 the future will be coming out more in 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.830
 triangles a game that is not everything 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.110
 simple against in our country is not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.669
 Find translated into Spanish 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.110
 officially but it is true that if 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.199
 we have the translated rules out there in 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.400
 pdf and that there are stores where you can 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.650
 get for example in our friends 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.840
 click to the role they have drive material 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.330
 ball so you can take advantage of 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.370
 get it at a good price is like 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.430
 I say a very entertaining game and if not no 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.599
 me what you say at the end of the month for nothing 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.669
 more in this introduction do not miss 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.800
 tomorrow the video with the content of this 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.820
 box is to say that there are several editions 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.880
 from the box 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.620
 basic ball dret 2 mainly that 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.509
 we will talk about them shortly but that 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.710
 during this month we will analyze the one that 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.420
 deluxe flame 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.740
 and it will tell you what are the 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.000
 differences as we see you tomorrow 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.000
 thanks for your time
