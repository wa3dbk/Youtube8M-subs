hopefully I'm able to show you a little
bit<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.690> my<00:00:36.200> training<00:00:36.890> program<00:00:37.630> it's

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
bit of my training program it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.060 
bit of my training program it's
something<00:00:38.989> I've<00:00:39.230> developed<00:00:39.500> over<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:39.950> past

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
something I've developed over the past

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.270 
something I've developed over the past
15<00:00:40.699> years<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.290> system<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.860> gives<00:00:43.070> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
15 years it's a system that gives the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.830 
15 years it's a system that gives the
horse<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.610> great<00:00:43.820> understanding<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.570> what<00:00:44.750> it

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
horse a great understanding of what it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.689 
horse a great understanding of what it
is<00:00:44.930> we<00:00:44.989> want<00:00:45.350> from<00:00:45.590> them<00:00:45.800> from<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.520> very

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
is we want from them from the very

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.369 
is we want from them from the very
beginning<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.390> starting<00:00:47.780> young<00:00:47.930> young<00:00:48.110> horse

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
beginning of starting young young horse

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.979 
beginning of starting young young horse
right<00:00:48.680> through<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.670> my<00:00:50.150> discipline<00:00:50.690> which<00:00:50.840> is

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
right through to my discipline which is

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.700 
right through to my discipline which is
dress<00:00:51.230> us<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.010> top<00:00:52.220> sport<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:53.710> have

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
dress us to the top sport I have

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.340 
dress us to the top sport I have
developed<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.970> system<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.480> lets<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.989> horses

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
developed a system that lets the horses

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.440 
developed a system that lets the horses
understand<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:58.940> want<00:00:59.180> those

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
understand what it is we want those

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.209 
understand what it is we want those
things<00:00:59.780> physically<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:00.770> you're<00:01:00.950> able<00:01:01.010> to

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
things physically so you're able to

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.400 
things physically so you're able to
control<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.730> horses<00:01:02.120> forward<00:01:02.840> back<00:01:03.020> left<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
control the horses forward back left and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.160 
control the horses forward back left and
right<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.879> also<00:01:04.879> mentally<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.720> horses<00:01:06.080> are

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
right and also mentally that horses are

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.630 
right and also mentally that horses are
able<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.530> respond<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.130> things<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:07.520> our

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
able to respond to things in our

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.670 
able to respond to things in our
environment<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.210> not<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.990> stressed<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.530> not

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
environment and not be stressed and not

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.190 
environment and not be stressed and not
be<00:01:09.830> fearful<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.360> tops<00:01:11.570> borders<00:01:12.050> it's

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
be fearful so for the tops borders it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.010 
be fearful so for the tops borders it's
a<00:01:12.320> great<00:01:12.550> system<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.910> try<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.180> absorb<00:01:14.660> little

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
a great system to try to absorb little

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.230 
a great system to try to absorb little
things<00:01:15.229> from<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.979> my<00:01:16.220> career<00:01:16.550> I've<00:01:16.610> tried<00:01:17.060> to

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
things from in my career I've tried to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300 
things from in my career I've tried to
absorb<00:01:17.390> everything<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.680> useful<00:01:18.860> from

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
absorb everything that is useful from

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.570 
absorb everything that is useful from
anyone<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.270> could<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.840> was<00:01:20.869> good<00:01:21.200> with<00:01:21.380> horses

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
anyone I could that was good with horses

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.550 
anyone I could that was good with horses
and<00:01:22.580> then<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:23.420> tried<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.960> develop<00:01:24.229> my<00:01:24.530> own

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
and then I just tried to develop my own

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950 
and then I just tried to develop my own
system<00:01:25.100> through<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.520> knowledge<00:01:25.960> basically

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
system through that knowledge basically

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.330 
system through that knowledge basically
our<00:01:27.970> program<00:01:29.530> revolves<00:01:30.530> around<00:01:30.619> two<00:01:31.070> main

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
our program revolves around two main

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.719 
our program revolves around two main
elements<00:01:32.020> those<00:01:33.020> elements<00:01:33.470> are<00:01:33.770> body<00:01:34.250> control

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
elements those elements are body control

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.940 
elements those elements are body control
and<00:01:34.939> control<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.479> feet<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.920> have

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
and control of the feet so that we have

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.500 
and control of the feet so that we have
control<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.490> each<00:01:37.760> of<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> four<00:01:38.270> feet

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
control of each of the four feet

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.980 
control of each of the four feet
independently<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.189> I'm<00:01:40.340> able<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.670> move<00:01:40.990> hind

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
independently so I'm able to move hind

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.620 
independently so I'm able to move hind
legs<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:42.799> my<00:01:43.040> legs<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.330> horse<00:01:44.509> is

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
legs from my legs and that the horse is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.740 
legs from my legs and that the horse is
able<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.290> learn<00:01:45.470> all<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:47.000> things<00:01:47.030> he<00:01:47.420> needs<00:01:47.630> to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
able to learn all the things he needs to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.929 
able to learn all the things he needs to
know<00:01:47.840> before<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.799> on<00:01:48.860> he<00:01:49.549> gets<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.909> idea

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
know before we get on he gets the idea

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.359 
know before we get on he gets the idea
she<00:01:50.630> has<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.960> know<00:01:50.990> what<00:01:51.439> gaff<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.920> when<00:01:52.189> she's

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
she has to know what gaff is when she's

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.399 
she has to know what gaff is when she's
eight<00:01:52.970> or<00:01:53.210> nine<00:01:53.360> years<00:01:53.390> old<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.020> wanted<00:01:54.259> to
