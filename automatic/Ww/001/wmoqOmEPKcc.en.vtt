themed<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.250> think<00:04:06.609> I<00:04:06.760> would<00:04:07.560> be<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> little

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
themed I think I would be a little

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.259 
themed I think I would be a little
harder<00:04:09.069> on<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:12.400> always<00:04:12.819> bumps<00:04:13.569> up<00:04:13.750> a

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
harder on it but that always bumps up a

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.719 
harder on it but that always bumps up a
food<00:04:16.269> product<00:04:16.599> about<00:04:17.410> 10<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.799> 20<00:04:18.039> percent<00:04:18.220> just

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
food product about 10 to 20 percent just

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.719 
food product about 10 to 20 percent just
based<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.419> fact<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.989> has<00:04:20.109> it<00:04:20.260> Italian

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729

I<00:04:21.729> like<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.479> shapes<00:04:22.750> there<00:04:23.110> they're<00:04:23.680> pretty

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
sounds like a good idea because it's

alliteration<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:49.510> shaped<00:04:50.169> brownies<00:04:50.889> bet

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
because the shape is hyphenated so it's

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.940 
because the shape is hyphenated so it's
