well<00:00:03.990> hi<00:00:04.170> everyone<00:00:04.529> welcome<00:00:04.680> back<00:00:05.509> I've<00:00:06.509> seen

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
well hi everyone welcome back I've seen

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.950 
well hi everyone welcome back I've seen
quite<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.470> few<00:00:07.529> people<00:00:07.980> requesting

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
quite a few people requesting

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
quite a few people requesting
temperature<00:00:09.960> comparisons<00:00:10.469> using<00:00:11.030> war

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
temperature comparisons using war

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.459 
temperature comparisons using war
killing<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.599> apparently<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.049> doesn't<00:00:13.139> seem

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
killing and apparently that doesn't seem

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.830 
killing and apparently that doesn't seem
to<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.620> too<00:00:13.650> many<00:00:16.550> videos<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.730> YouTube<00:00:18.150> with

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to be too many videos on YouTube with

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
to be too many videos on YouTube with
reference<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.650> subjects<00:00:20.160> alpha<00:00:20.520> well

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
reference to that subjects alpha well

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.950 
reference to that subjects alpha well
let's<00:00:20.820> start<00:00:20.970> let's<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.689> put

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
let's start let's see what we can put

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.550 
let's start let's see what we can put
together<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> weapon<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> choice<00:00:24.350> in<00:00:25.350> days

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
together so the weapon of choice in days

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.599 
together so the weapon of choice in days
gone<00:00:25.590> by<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.220> stressing<00:00:27.320> video<00:00:28.320> cards<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
gone by for stressing video cards is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.510 
gone by for stressing video cards is
furmark<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.980> with<00:00:31.980> gtx<00:00:32.399> 480<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.860> gtx<00:00:34.860> 580<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
furmark but with gtx 480 and gtx 580 and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
furmark but with gtx 480 and gtx 580 and
so<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> would<00:00:35.969> seem<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> gtx<00:00:36.719> 570<00:00:37.290> which<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> my

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so it would seem the gtx 570 which is my

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
so it would seem the gtx 570 which is my
gpu's<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gpu's as you can see there one of the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770 
gpu's as you can see there one of the
cards<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> only<00:00:40.379> running<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.829> half<00:00:41.329> after<00:00:42.329> said

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
cards is only running a half after said

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
cards is only running a half after said
efficiency<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.219> seem<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
efficiency and it would seem that

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
efficiency and it would seem that
there's<00:00:44.899> something<00:00:45.899> built<00:00:46.170> into<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> program

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there's something built into the program

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.240 
there's something built into the program
that<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> nvidia<00:00:47.489> driver<00:00:47.760> recognizes<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
that the nvidia driver recognizes and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.110 
that the nvidia driver recognizes and
doesn't<00:00:50.250> allow<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.760> balls<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> I'll

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
doesn't allow it to go balls out so I'll

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
doesn't allow it to go balls out so I'll
so<00:00:54.600> yes<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> temperature<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> extreme

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so yes that temperature on the extreme

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.279 
so yes that temperature on the extreme
right<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> current<00:00:57.600> cooler

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
right there that's the current cooler

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.160 
right there that's the current cooler
temperature<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.329> though<00:01:00.359> furmark<00:01:00.930> there

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
temperature so even though furmark there

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.529 
temperature so even though furmark there
fully<00:01:01.500> maxed<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.120> getting<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
fully maxed is you know getting the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
fully maxed is you know getting the
water<00:01:03.629> loop<00:01:04.100> getting<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> cooling<00:01:05.460> loop

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
water loop getting the cooling loop

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.160 
water loop getting the cooling loop
temperatures<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.740> isn't<00:01:07.890> fully

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
temperatures up it really isn't fully

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.969 
temperatures up it really isn't fully
fully<00:01:10.170> stressing<00:01:10.680> both<00:01:10.939> gpus<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
fully stressing both gpus so there is

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.260 
fully stressing both gpus so there is
there<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> another<00:01:14.250> program<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.240> use

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
there is another program that we can use

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.560 
there is another program that we can use
which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.950> test<00:01:17.310> mart

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.110 

the<00:01:19.710> comes<00:01:20.710> from<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> same<00:01:21.070> people<00:01:21.430> ozone<00:01:21.760> 3d

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
the comes from the same people ozone 3d

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.030 
the comes from the same people ozone 3d
would<00:01:22.240> make<00:01:22.420> block<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.620> uses

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
would make block and this uses

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.030 
would make block and this uses
tessellation<00:01:24.850> which<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.930> directx<00:01:26.650> 11

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
tessellation which is the directx 11

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.810 
tessellation which is the directx 11
technology<00:01:27.850> uses<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.300> tessellation<00:01:28.690> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
technology uses the tessellation to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
technology uses the tessellation to
among<00:01:30.820> other<00:01:30.910> things<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.360> fully<00:01:31.570> stress<00:01:31.870> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
among other things to fully stress the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.880 
among other things to fully stress the
pulley<00:01:33.310> stress<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.700> GPUs<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:35.770> go

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
pulley stress the GPUs so here we go

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.770 
pulley stress the GPUs so here we go
then<00:01:36.100> we<00:01:36.190> got<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> set<00:01:36.700> balls<00:01:36.970> out<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.330> Baghdad

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
then we got it set balls out to Baghdad

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.890 
then we got it set balls out to Baghdad
everything<00:01:38.290> absolutely<00:01:38.680> maxed<00:01:39.610> out<00:01:39.900> benching

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
tessellation set so using the g 19 we

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.940 
tessellation set so using the g 19 we
can<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> look<00:01:52.600> again<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.140> GPU<00:01:53.740> load

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
can have a look again at the GPU load

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.920 
can have a look again at the GPU load
and<00:01:54.160> sure<00:01:54.369> enough<00:01:54.399> there<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:54.789> go<00:01:54.910> both<00:01:55.210> gpus

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
and sure enough there we go both gpus

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.010 
and sure enough there we go both gpus

frames at the higher setting which is
pretty<00:02:13.540> good<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.780> think

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.300 

so<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.940> fear<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.180> getting<00:02:18.740> people<00:02:19.740> nodding<00:02:20.100> off

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so in fear of getting people nodding off

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.880 
so in fear of getting people nodding off
watching<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.880> I'll<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.960> give<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
watching this I'll just get give you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
watching this I'll just get give you
another<00:02:23.100> quick<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:25.020> actual

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
another quick look at the actual

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.960 
another quick look at the actual
rendering<00:02:25.770> information<00:02:26.460> there<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:26.850> on

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
rendering information there and it's on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.200 
rendering information there and it's on
the<00:02:27.060> left<00:02:27.150> corner<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.680> we'll<00:02:29.210> skip

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
the left corner and then we'll skip

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.420 
the left corner and then we'll skip
ahead<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.810> time<00:02:30.990> well<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.370> about

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
ahead in time well I think it's about

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.990 
ahead in time well I think it's about
10-15<00:02:33.120> minutes<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.890> show<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.130> where<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
10-15 minutes to show you where the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.930 
10-15 minutes to show you where the
temperatures<00:02:36.510> sort<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.020> stabilized<00:02:37.940> and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
temperatures sort of stabilized and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.840 
temperatures sort of stabilized and
where<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> cooling<00:02:39.540> move<00:02:39.720> ended<00:02:40.050> up<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
where the cooling move ended up that

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.870 
where the cooling move ended up that
there<00:02:42.510> i<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.610> six<00:02:44.610> or<00:02:44.730> seven

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
there i think is about six or seven

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.450 
there i think is about six or seven
minutes<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.860> then<00:02:47.240> as<00:02:48.240> if<00:02:48.450> by<00:02:48.660> magic<00:02:49.460> five

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
minutes and then as if by magic five

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.170 
minutes and then as if by magic five
four<00:02:50.670> three<00:02:50.700> two<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:52.610> okay<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
four three two one okay this is so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.670 
four three two one okay this is so
unprofessional

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.130 

come<00:02:57.219> on<00:02:57.340> click<00:02:57.730> your<00:02:57.849> fingers<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.930> will

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
come on click your fingers it will

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.480 
come on click your fingers it will
happen

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
happen

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.970 
happen
but<00:03:00.790> not<00:03:00.940> yet

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
but not yet

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.450 
but not yet
maybe<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.610> minute<00:03:02.959> crap<00:03:03.959> I'm<00:03:04.140> gonna<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.500> is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
maybe in a minute crap I'm gonna do is

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.740 
maybe in a minute crap I'm gonna do is
here<00:03:07.460> we<00:03:07.550> go

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
here we go

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.450 
here we go
so<00:03:09.320> that<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.650> current<00:03:09.920> GPU<00:03:10.250> loop

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
so that was the current GPU loop

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.090 
so that was the current GPU loop

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.760 
degrees is the hottest one
and

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.650 

maybe<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.850> bit<00:03:38.000> where<00:03:38.150> we<00:03:38.180> suddenly

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
maybe this is the bit where we suddenly

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.600 
maybe this is the bit where we suddenly
spring<00:03:39.140> ahead<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.440> time<00:03:39.590> like<00:03:39.860> Doctor<00:03:40.220> Who

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.670 

just<00:03:45.150> twiddle<00:03:45.420> my<00:03:45.450> thumb's<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.870> minute

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.709 

there<00:03:50.340> we<00:03:50.489> go<00:03:51.500> right<00:03:53.299> okay<00:03:54.299> this<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.569> after

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:54.719 
there we go right okay this is after

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.039 
there we go right okay this is after
about<00:03:54.900> 15<00:03:55.319> or<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.040> minutes<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.659> can<00:03:57.780> see

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
about 15 or so minutes as you can see

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.709 
about 15 or so minutes as you can see
the<00:03:58.230> temperatures<00:03:58.620> pretty<00:03:59.340> muched<00:03:59.760> pretty

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
the temperatures pretty muched pretty

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.479 
the temperatures pretty muched pretty

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
much stabilized the hottest it got was

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.580 
much stabilized the hottest it got was
about<00:04:02.609> 60<00:04:03.299> degrees<00:04:03.390> there<00:04:03.870> one<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.200> GPUs

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
about 60 degrees there one of the GPUs

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.459 
about 60 degrees there one of the GPUs
about<00:04:04.859> 60<00:04:05.159> degrees<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.780> if<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.900> flash<00:04:07.200> across

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
about 60 degrees and if I flash across

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.569 
about 60 degrees and if I flash across

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
okay so there's the guilty parties

can<00:04:56.010> see<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.250> dynamically<00:04:56.900> drop<00:04:57.900> right<00:04:58.110> back

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
can see it's dynamically drop right back

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.610 
can see it's dynamically drop right back
to<00:04:58.470> default<00:04:58.650> clocks<00:04:59.160> i<00:04:59.460> have<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.510> bios<00:05:01.080> set<00:05:01.380> so

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
to default clocks i have the bios set so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.910 
to default clocks i have the bios set so
that<00:05:01.650> their<00:05:01.950> clock<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.850> cpu<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:04.050> scale<00:05:04.890> down

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
that their clock the cpu can scale down

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.890 
that their clock the cpu can scale down
when<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.370> not<00:05:05.460> loaded<00:05:05.790> up<00:05:05.910> not<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.660> test

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
when it's not loaded up not the test

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.210 
when it's not loaded up not the test
mark<00:05:07.110> would<00:05:07.260> load<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.500> up<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.740> much<00:05:07.890> anyway

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
mark would load it up that much anyway

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.790 
mark would load it up that much anyway
and<00:05:08.460> there<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.930> quick<00:05:10.290> shot<00:05:10.470> of<00:05:12.740> there's<00:05:13.740> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
and there is a quick shot of there's the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.550 
and there is a quick shot of there's the
GPU<00:05:14.160> loop<00:05:14.310> coming<00:05:14.580> back<00:05:14.760> down<00:05:15.140> and<00:05:16.140> previously

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
GPU loop coming back down and previously

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.260 
GPU loop coming back down and previously
that<00:05:16.740> was<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:16.920> shot<00:05:17.190> of<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.550> multiple

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
that was a shot of the multiple

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.159 
that was a shot of the multiple
temperatures

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
temperatures

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.529 
temperatures
so<00:05:20.830> there<00:05:20.979> you<00:05:21.009> go<00:05:21.099> hopefully<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:21.729> was<00:05:21.909> used

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
so there you go hopefully this was used

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.469 
so there you go hopefully this was used
to<00:05:22.629> some<00:05:22.779> of<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:22.990> very<00:05:23.379> quick<00:05:23.590> look<00:05:23.830> at<00:05:24.479> how

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
to some of you very quick look at how

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.830 
to some of you very quick look at how
war<00:05:25.659> calling<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:27.150> help<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.210> keep<00:05:28.330> your<00:05:28.479> GPUs

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
war calling can help you keep your GPUs

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.769 
war calling can help you keep your GPUs
cooler<00:05:29.469> then<00:05:29.740> stop<00:05:30.219> cooling<00:05:30.659> hope<00:05:31.659> you

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
cooler then stop cooling hope you

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.469 
cooler then stop cooling hope you
enjoyed<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.080> please<00:05:33.069> please<00:05:33.969> feel<00:05:34.210> free<00:05:34.240> to

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
enjoyed it please please feel free to

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.919 
enjoyed it please please feel free to
comment<00:05:35.199> thank<00:05:35.770> you
