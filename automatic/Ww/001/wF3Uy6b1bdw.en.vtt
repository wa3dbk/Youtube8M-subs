00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
cut it to be able to show you this but

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.090 
cut it to be able to show you this but
nonetheless<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.650> easy<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> attach

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
nonetheless it is very easy to attach

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.520 
nonetheless it is very easy to attach
just<00:01:38.250> clip<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.030> plug<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> hard<00:01:40.409> drive

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just clip it on plug in the hard drive

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.170 
just clip it on plug in the hard drive
and<00:01:40.740> screw<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.100> back<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.060> see

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and screw it all back in as you can see

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
and screw it all back in as you can see
it<00:01:42.270> does<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.420> two<00:01:42.750> sodium<00:01:43.049> ram<00:01:43.409> slots<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.890> if

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it does have two sodium ram slots so if

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
it does have two sodium ram slots so if
you<00:01:44.040> did<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.180> make<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> more

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you did want to you know make a more

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
you did want to you know make a more
powerful<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> useful<00:01:47.490> system<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> could<00:01:48.299> add

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
powerful and useful system you could add

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
powerful and useful system you could add
another<00:01:48.659> ram<00:01:49.140> slaw<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.799> also<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.220> change

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
another ram slaw and also you can change

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
another ram slaw and also you can change
out<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> SSD<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> wanted<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.470> also

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
out the SSD if you wanted to this also

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
out the SSD if you wanted to this also
does<00:01:52.920> come<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.430> i5<00:01:53.850> version<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.329> well<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.720> if

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
does come in an i5 version as well so if

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
does come in an i5 version as well so if
you<00:01:54.899> wanted<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.619> bit<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you wanted to get a bit more power and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.149 
you wanted to get a bit more power and
from<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.960> rather<00:01:58.409> incredibly<00:01:58.979> small

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
from this rather incredibly small

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
from this rather incredibly small
form-factor<00:01:59.490> pc<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.960> definitely<00:02:01.140> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
form-factor pc then you definitely can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
form-factor pc then you definitely can
instead<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.820> switch<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.299> ram<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
instead you can switch at the ram and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
instead you can switch at the ram and
that's<00:02:03.840> obviously<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.680> nice<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that's obviously it's really nice to be

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
that's obviously it's really nice to be
able<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.369> customizability<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
able to have customizability and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.240 
able to have customizability and
something<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.020> small<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.740> very<00:02:07.890> similar<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
something so small it's very similar to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
something so small it's very similar to
intel's<00:02:08.849> knucks<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.450> they're<00:02:09.539> actually

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
intel's knucks but they're actually

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
intel's knucks but they're actually
smaller<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.800> my<00:02:10.890> opinion<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.340> one's<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
smaller and in my opinion this one's a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.030 
smaller and in my opinion this one's a
bit<00:02:11.790> nicer<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.450> by

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
bit nicer or by

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.339 
bit nicer or by
one<00:02:13.159> issue<00:02:13.310> which<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.819> have<00:02:14.000> which<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.810> actually

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
one issue which I have which is actually

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.110 
one issue which I have which is actually
the<00:02:15.650> fan<00:02:15.860> inside<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.459> sounds<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:16.969> there's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the fan inside of it sounds like there's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.750 
the fan inside of it sounds like there's
something<00:02:17.269> clicking<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.099> for<00:02:19.099> some<00:02:19.250> reason<00:02:19.609> I

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
something clicking but for some reason I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.149 
something clicking but for some reason I
am<00:02:20.000> even<00:02:20.599> when<00:02:20.719> I<00:02:20.750> took<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.079> off<00:02:21.170> took<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:21.920> apart

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
am even when I took it off took it apart

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.979 
am even when I took it off took it apart
as<00:02:22.340> you'll<00:02:22.459> see<00:02:22.609> in<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.760> second<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.900> know

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
as you'll see in a second and you know

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.009 
as you'll see in a second and you know
it<00:02:24.140> still<00:02:24.530> didn't<00:02:24.920> make<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.340> much<00:02:25.549> noise

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
it still didn't make that much noise

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.910 
it still didn't make that much noise
it<00:02:27.019> didn't<00:02:27.319> look<00:02:27.409> like<00:02:27.469> there<00:02:27.650> was<00:02:27.769> anything

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
it didn't look like there was anything

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.679 
it didn't look like there was anything
in<00:02:28.129> there<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:28.969> doesn't<00:02:29.209> make<00:02:29.359> that

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
in there but and it doesn't make that

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.690 
in there but and it doesn't make that
loader<00:02:30.049> noise<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:30.739> quite<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.280> an<00:02:31.519> an

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
loader noise it's just quite of an an

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.819 
loader noise it's just quite of an an
annoying<00:02:32.120> noise<00:02:32.390> personally<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:33.409> a<00:02:33.439> listen

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
annoying noise personally have a listen

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:48.200 
annoying noise personally have a listen
TV<00:02:34.159> thing

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.120 

no<00:02:48.870> bearing<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.290> mind<00:02:49.320> there's<00:02:49.620> no<00:02:49.740> hard<00:02:49.950> drive

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
no bearing in mind there's no hard drive

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.370 
no bearing in mind there's no hard drive
and<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.640> purely<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.240> fan<00:02:51.570> there<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and so that is purely that fan there and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.350 
and so that is purely that fan there and
I<00:02:52.470> said<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.370> something<00:02:53.640> inside<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.210> sort

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I said it was something inside it sort

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330 
I said it was something inside it sort
of<00:02:54.420> clicking<00:02:54.720> away<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.830> personally<00:02:56.220> this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
of clicking away and personally this

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
of clicking away and personally this
made<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.640> almost<00:02:56.910> unusable<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.930> me<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.320> just

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
made it almost unusable for me and just

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.800 
made it almost unusable for me and just
because<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.160> way<00:02:59.580> my<00:02:59.610> room<00:02:59.940> setup<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
because the way my room setup and as you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.810 
because the way my room setup and as you
can<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> corner<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.460> was<00:03:02.640> very

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
can see it was in the corner it was very

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.420 
can see it was in the corner it was very
sort<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.090> echoing<00:03:03.600> flat<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:05.100> when<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> did

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
sort of echoing flat so but when I did

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.100 
sort of echoing flat so but when I did
have<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.580> downstairs<00:03:06.000> actually<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> lot

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
have it downstairs actually I was a lot

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.680 
have it downstairs actually I was a lot
more<00:03:07.140> impressed<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.710> lot<00:03:07.980> quieter<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.670> seem<00:03:09.660> to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
more impressed a lot quieter and seem to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
more impressed a lot quieter and seem to
just<00:03:10.020> be<00:03:10.080> generally<00:03:10.620> better<00:03:10.890> especially

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
just be generally better especially

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.010 
just be generally better especially
while<00:03:11.820> listening<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.480> something<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.960> a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the use of this this isn't overly

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.240 
the use of this this isn't overly

and<00:03:42.120> game<00:03:42.960> streaming<00:03:43.320> should<00:03:43.650> work<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.100> theory

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and game streaming should work in theory

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.950 
and game streaming should work in theory
if<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.240> know<00:03:45.360> Gigabit<00:03:45.900> Ethernet

if you have a you know Gigabit Ethernet

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.440 
if you have a you know Gigabit Ethernet
but<00:03:46.470> um<00:03:46.740> yeah<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.520> really<00:03:47.910> small<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.420> very

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
but um yeah it is really small it's very

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.450 
but um yeah it is really small it's very
powerful<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:49.230> its<00:03:49.260> size<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.980> got<00:03:50.160> lots<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
powerful for its size it's got lots of

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.760 
powerful for its size it's got lots of
options<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:51.120> very<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.080> know<00:03:52.110> loads<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.500> users

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
options a very you know loads of users

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.470 
options a very you know loads of users
in<00:03:52.890> my<00:03:53.040> opinion<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> nice<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:54.150> know<00:03:54.240> matte

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
in my opinion the nice you know matte

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.270 
in my opinion the nice you know matte
white<00:03:54.660> plastic<00:03:55.230> or<00:03:55.350> black<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:55.920> want<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.220> in

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
white plastic or black if you want it in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.100 
white plastic or black if you want it in
black<00:03:56.460> and<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:57.300> very<00:03:57.480> stylish<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.960> only

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
black and it's very stylish the only

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.890 
black and it's very stylish the only
thing<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.470> from<00:03:58.980> me<00:03:59.300> to<00:04:00.300> compare<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.750> to

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
thing is that from me to compare this to

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.630 
thing is that from me to compare this to
get<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.230> gigabyte<00:04:01.740> bricks<00:04:02.040> well<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> bricks

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
get the gigabyte bricks well the bricks

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.420 
get the gigabyte bricks well the bricks
is<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.850> lot<00:04:03.030> more<00:04:03.180> expensive<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:04.020> comparison<00:04:04.430> it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
is a lot more expensive in comparison it

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.460 
is a lot more expensive in comparison it
didn't<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.030> fan<00:04:06.240> issue<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:07.320> there's

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
didn't have the fan issue and there's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.380 
didn't have the fan issue and there's
very<00:04:07.620> similar<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.040> style<00:04:08.310> options<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.120> also

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
very similar of style options and also

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.110 
very similar of style options and also
stuff<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.930> um<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.550> got<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> compare<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
stuff so um you just got a compare and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.840 
stuff so um you just got a compare and
maybe<00:04:12.690> perhaps<00:04:13.080> my<00:04:13.410> unit<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.800> bit<00:04:14.010> Fe<00:04:14.640> but

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
maybe perhaps my unit is a bit Fe but

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.580 
maybe perhaps my unit is a bit Fe but
anyway<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.720> vote<00:04:15.930> for<00:04:15.960> money<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.320> going<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.500> be

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
anyway and vote for money is going to be

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470 
anyway and vote for money is going to be
a<00:04:16.620> 5<00:04:16.920> as<00:04:17.220> said<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.820> bit<00:04:17.970> cheaper<00:04:18.150> than<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
a 5 as said it's a bit cheaper than the

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.090 
a 5 as said it's a bit cheaper than the
brick<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:18.840> that's<00:04:18.989> always<00:04:19.170> nice<00:04:19.410> performance

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
brick so that's always nice performance

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.920 
brick so that's always nice performance
going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.310> be<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> 4<00:04:20.640> because<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.120> i3<00:04:21.540> version

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
going to be a 4 because the i3 version

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.860 
going to be a 4 because the i3 version
and<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.890> know<00:04:23.010> there's<00:04:23.490> some<00:04:23.870> functionality

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
and you know there's some functionality

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.240 
and you know there's some functionality
of<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> which<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.410> why<00:04:25.530> functionality<00:04:26.130> got

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
of it which is why functionality got

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.680 
of it which is why functionality got
four<00:04:26.460> as<00:04:26.550> well<00:04:26.670> and<00:04:26.970> was<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> little<00:04:27.330> bit<00:04:27.450> iffy

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690

overall it's going to get a tech team GB
score<00:04:31.020> 4<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:32.100> as<00:04:32.430> said<00:04:32.730> um<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.360> as<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:34.050> can
