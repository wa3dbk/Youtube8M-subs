00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:11.940
 that our mayor is projected towards 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 the future so projected by 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.970
 also assume the appearance of one of the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 star trek characters instead of entering 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 and getting out of a blue car I get the feeling 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.590
 that he would prefer to come in and out of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.109
 a flying saucer like the present not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 interest 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 and a few days ago that to a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.610
 journalist he came out of a conference 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 which obviously spoke of the future 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 is a journalist who asked him if the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 however, many citizens say yes in the future 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.120
 they complain that the buses do 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.140
 they see only passing with the wagon 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.059
 tools that we now say from 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 urban garbage has become a big one 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.260
 modern action that will probably be needed 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 as a score for palermo capital 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 of European culture in 2019 2019 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 time passed and told me this and he 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 he replied but to me these things did not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.000
 interest are are discounted I think 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 to the palermo of 2020 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 I understand but you will get a loved one 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780
 Mr. Mayor, but we don't get to the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 2007 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.320
 let's say it's a situation you do n't find a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.829
 he asks embarrassingly 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.030
 now I read that the plan too 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.350
 of which no one felt the need 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 in the meantime because that of orlando if not 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.409
 remember badly it was approved 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.240
 nine years ago 8 9 10 something like that 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.310
 and we have been with the famous for 50 years 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 ciancimino floor 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.810
 the plan approved by the council 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.630
 municipal 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 then all in all we say it was enough 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 realistic 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.910
 I'm not a globalist, I'm alone though 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 that came to the region 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.760
 the plan approved by the council 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.760
 municipal 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.050
 that 's what we say the structures 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.120
 will win easily mouldable is as if 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 to the region suddenly this 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.950
 dough depends on a regulator equipped 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.950
 vito ciancimino precise 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.980
 this is the current situation 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.220
 suddenly our mayor 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.310
 I repeat the taxes that fall on the monuments 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 the biggest decay falls on the floor 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:59.440
 regulator for 2050 children also i 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.290
 look especially for the 6 that this southern 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 we say that often pennant from cars 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.150
 run also there are those who turn for this 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200
 city 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.800
 they know they discover now that in each 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.360
 building there will be 60 70 categorical 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.350
 written for sale for sale 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:25.260
 rent then commute this need 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.260
 of a master plan for 2050 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.630
 no one pictures so why 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.490
 because this plan as it will be 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.450
 where the plan debate takes place 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.050
 office level regulator of 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 experts department 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.930
 I already imagine the new Palermo 2050 forums 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.370
 which is always one of those stories of 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.340
 verne did not come true and probably it was 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.830
 what ingo 2050 is not clear how it will be 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.209
 who knows how to do we are to the prodrome but 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.600
 as far as pro where I get the feeling that 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.660
 this new idea futurist mayor mar 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.580
 reptiles are our this idea 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.609
 futurist than in area completely at the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.620
 flying saucer but in the air 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.620
 who needs it because 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.870
 all heart is a moore barney area is 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.610
 but the feeling I had when I was 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.949
 have communicated this news is the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:39.900
 itself recalled some customs 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:44.919
 civil or military navy 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:51.159
 for which it is embarked neither a vapor with a 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:57.279
 long way he used to leave his own 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:05:00.909
 pregnant wife as well as how she puts it 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:04.360
 the busy hat well this is the 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:09.819
 hat of the regulator plan for the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:14.580
 palermo of 2050 this is the year 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:18.629
 of the year 2013 decidedly 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.629
 unlucky thank you
