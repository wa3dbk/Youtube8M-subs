this<00:00:17.220> one<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.580> everything<00:00:18.330> together

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this one I think everything together

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
this one I think everything together
with<00:00:18.869> shipping<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.619> 80<00:00:19.859> bucks<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.640> I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
with shipping it was like 80 bucks so I

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.890 
with shipping it was like 80 bucks so I
just<00:00:20.910> bought<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.150> they<00:00:21.359> didn't<00:00:21.570> send<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:21.779> this

or<00:00:22.050> anything<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.010> I've<00:00:23.100> been<00:00:23.220> playing<00:00:23.460> around

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580

with<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.060> couple<00:00:24.150> weeks<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.660> probably

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
with it for a couple weeks it's probably

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130

my<00:00:25.920> favorite<00:00:26.430> object<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> own<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.990> now

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
my favorite object that I own right now

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
my favorite object that I own right now
you<00:00:28.500> only<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.949> sort<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.779> 16<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> change

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you only get sort of 16 and change

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.450 
you only get sort of 16 and change
buttons<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> guess<00:00:32.239> 23<00:00:33.239> buttons<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.460> that

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
buttons I guess 23 buttons and that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.430 
buttons I guess 23 buttons and that
determines<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> everything<00:00:37.290> you're

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
determines kind of everything you're

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069 
determines kind of everything you're
gonna<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.510> melodies<00:00:39.840> are

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
gonna do with all the melodies are

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.440 
gonna do with all the melodies are
programmed<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.829> advance<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:42.059> play

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
programmed in in advance so you can play

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
programmed in in advance so you can play
it<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.809> traditional<00:00:43.260> instrument<00:00:43.410> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it like a traditional instrument but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
it like a traditional instrument but
it's<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.270> sort<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.719> supposed

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's really you're sort of not supposed

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's really you're sort of not supposed
to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.760> works<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> program<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
to the way it works is you program the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
to the way it works is you program the
melodies<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> hit<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> button<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> turn

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
melodies in hit a button and you turn

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.529 
melodies in hit a button and you turn
this<00:00:51.780> knob<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.489> says<00:00:53.850> okay<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> want

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this knob and it says okay do I want

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.209 
this knob and it says okay do I want
that<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> C<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.649> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> D

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that to be a C or do I want to be a D

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.380 
that to be a C or do I want to be a D
and<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.460> sort<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> turn<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> knob<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and you sort of turn the knob which is

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
and you sort of turn the knob which is
really<00:00:57.629> awkward<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> takes<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.710> while

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
really awkward and kind of takes a while

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
really awkward and kind of takes a while
but<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> plus<00:01:00.180> side<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.480> once<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> have

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
but the plus side is once you have

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
but the plus side is once you have
programmed<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.559> it'll<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.699> play<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
programmed in it'll just play over and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.490 
programmed in it'll just play over and
over<00:01:03.449> again<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.080> sort<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.320> worry

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
over again and you can sort of worry

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.280 
over again and you can sort of worry
about<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.890> things<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:06.990> I've<00:01:07.140> got

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
about other things so right now I've got

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
about other things so right now I've got
it<00:01:07.320> programmed<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> play<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> bass<00:01:08.580> line<00:01:08.850> from

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it programmed to play the bass line from

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.710 
it programmed to play the bass line from
Billie<00:01:09.390> Jean<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> looks

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
Billie Jean so this is what it looks

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
Billie Jean so this is what it looks
like<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.170> working<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.979> I've

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
like when it's working you know I've

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679 
like when it's working you know I've
done<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> grunt<00:01:14.909> work<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> programming

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
done all the grunt work of programming

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
done all the grunt work of programming
it<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.930> uh<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.820> what

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it in uh you know you can see what

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.340 
it in uh you know you can see what
that's<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.150> I'll<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.600> put<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.140> mode

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that's like I'll just put in right mode

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
that's like I'll just put in right mode
and<00:01:19.759> if<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.909> want<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> change<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> note<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and if I want to change this note to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.480 
and if I want to change this note to
something<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.229> higher<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.159> turn<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
something much higher I just turn the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.690 
something much higher I just turn the
style<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.009> an<00:01:26.250> octave<00:01:26.520> higher<00:01:26.670> than

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
style so now it's an octave higher than

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
style so now it's an octave higher than
what's<00:01:27.060> before<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
what's before you see it's not really a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.789 
what's before you see it's not really a
satisfying<00:01:32.369> way<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:33.990> change<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
satisfying way to you know change the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.499 
satisfying way to you know change the
notes<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.400> sort<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.299> mind

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
notes you have to sort of have in mind

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.219 
notes you have to sort of have in mind
in<00:01:36.720> advance<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.720> effects

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
in advance what you want but the effects

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
in advance what you want but the effects
are<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.799> immediate<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
are much more immediate so if I want to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
are much more immediate so if I want to
add<00:01:42.540> distortion<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.799> same<00:01:44.100> note<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.520> can

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
add distortion in that same note I can

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.389 
add distortion in that same note I can
just

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.950 

I'll<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:54.359> where<00:01:55.159> I'll<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:57.200> always<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
I'll be where I'll be always and see the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
I'll be where I'll be always and see the
baseline<00:02:00.960> starts<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> change<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.039> it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
baseline starts to change but it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.819 
baseline starts to change but it's
better<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.479> well<00:02:04.439> anyway<00:02:04.710> it's

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
better because it's well anyway it's

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
better because it's well anyway it's
different<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.280> its<00:02:05.520> effect<00:02:06.450> what's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
different because its effect what's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.869 
different because its effect what's
changing<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:08.129> punching<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
changing is that I'm punching and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.460 
changing is that I'm punching and
effects<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.269> punching<00:02:09.569> them<00:02:09.750> there's<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
effects or punching them there's this

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.830 
effects or punching them there's this
submarine<00:02:11.269> visualization<00:02:12.269> in<00:02:12.480> front<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
submarine visualization in front of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
submarine visualization in front of
everything<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.319> each<00:02:13.950> torpedo<00:02:14.580> that's

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
everything so each torpedo that's

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.690 
everything so each torpedo that's
getting<00:02:15.150> shot<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.049> beat<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
getting shot out is a beat and the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160 
getting shot out is a beat and the
different<00:02:18.030> machines<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.569> different<00:02:18.840> effects

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
different machines are different effects

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.360 
different machines are different effects
so<00:02:19.260> he's<00:02:19.379> running<00:02:19.680> between<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.099> different

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so he's running between the different

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.920 
so he's running between the different
machines<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.790> sort<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> effects

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
machines to sort of put in the effects

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.660 
machines to sort of put in the effects
that<00:02:21.989> I've<00:02:22.140> already<00:02:22.410> punched<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.400> no

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that I've already punched in I have no

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.500 
that I've already punched in I have no
idea<00:02:24.030> what<00:02:24.299> is<00:02:24.420> going<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:27.060> result<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
idea what is going on so the result is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
idea what is going on so the result is
when<00:02:27.690> you're<00:02:27.810> playing<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.440> mostly<00:02:28.860> what

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
when you're playing it mostly what

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.380 
when you're playing it mostly what
you're<00:02:29.099> doing<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.579> you're<00:02:29.730> punching<00:02:30.030> in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you're doing is you're punching in

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.240 
you're doing is you're punching in
effects<00:02:31.019> which<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> very<00:02:31.739> different<00:02:31.980> way<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
effects which is a very different way to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.710 
effects which is a very different way to
think<00:02:32.370> about<00:02:32.790> music<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.450> sort<00:02:33.660> of

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
think about music and sort of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479 
think about music and sort of
performance<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:34.920> way<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.160> has<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> lot

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
performance and it's a way it has a lot

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.190 
performance and it's a way it has a lot
more<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.090> popular<00:02:36.569> music<00:02:36.900> works

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
more to do with how popular music works

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.780 
more to do with how popular music works
right<00:02:37.500> now<00:02:37.650> when<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> hear<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.459> particularly

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
right now when you hear a particularly

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
right now when you hear a particularly
sort<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.269> rousing<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.870> affecting<00:02:40.260> part<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
sort of rousing or affecting part of a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.530 
sort of rousing or affecting part of a
pop<00:02:40.860> song<00:02:41.099> it's<00:02:41.519> generally<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.209> some<00:02:42.420> new

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
pop song it's generally because some new

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.940 
pop song it's generally because some new
instruments<00:02:42.750> coming<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.380> they're<00:02:43.560> putting<00:02:43.860> in

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
instruments coming in they're putting in

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.250 
instruments coming in they're putting in
some<00:02:44.130> effect<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:45.299> know<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> bass<00:02:45.690> drop<00:02:46.019> that's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
some effect you know a bass drop that's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.979 
some effect you know a bass drop that's
that's<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.799> bass<00:02:46.980> drop<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.519> that's<00:02:48.030> sort

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
that's what a bass drop is that's sort

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.509 
that's what a bass drop is that's sort
of<00:02:49.110> hard<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.739> software<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.190> mean<00:02:50.340> that's

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
of hard to do in software I mean that's

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.850 
of hard to do in software I mean that's
generally<00:02:50.910> how<00:02:50.940> people<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.560> very

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
generally how people do it but it's very

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.129 
generally how people do it but it's very
difficult<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.660> sense<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.079> a

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
difficult to get that sense of a

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.900 
difficult to get that sense of a
performance<00:02:55.799> generally<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:56.670> sort<00:02:56.880> of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
performance generally you're sort of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.240 
performance generally you're sort of
arranging<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:57.600> effects<00:02:58.109> in<00:02:58.230> advance<00:02:58.620> you

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
arranging these effects in advance you

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520 
arranging these effects in advance you
have<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.489> sort<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.940> know<00:03:00.150> what<00:03:00.359> you're<00:03:00.530> going

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
have to sort of know what you're going

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.289 
have to sort of know what you're going
for<00:03:01.560> before<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.190> do<00:03:02.519> it

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
for before you do it

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.120 
for before you do it
whereas<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:04.260> know<00:03:04.319> having<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.769> little<00:03:05.010> guy

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
whereas you know having a little guy

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.069 
whereas you know having a little guy
like<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.549> lets<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.209> really<00:03:06.389> get<00:03:06.660> into<00:03:06.930> it

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
like this lets you really get into it

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.420 
like this lets you really get into it
and<00:03:07.230> feel<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.980> sort<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.220> much<00:03:08.400> more

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
and feel it in a sort of much more

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.390 
and feel it in a sort of much more
visceral<00:03:09.060> way<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.139> don't<00:03:10.680> know<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
visceral way so I don't know I like it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.350 
visceral way so I don't know I like it
and<00:03:11.519> I've<00:03:12.150> had<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.359> lot<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.569> fun<00:03:12.720> with

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360
