we have a lot of trees alright now we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.020 
we have a lot of trees alright now we
want<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.530> able<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.830> use<00:00:11.099> all<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.519> field<00:00:11.820> as

want to be able to use all this field as
you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.269> see<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.750> these<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:12.990> already

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.230 
you can see some of these are already
plowed<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.860> had<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> lay<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.610> new<00:00:14.700> layers<00:00:14.940> down

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
plowed I had to lay some new layers down

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.910 
plowed I had to lay some new layers down
here<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> start<00:00:16.170> over<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> figure

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
here so we had to start over so I figure

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
here so we had to start over so I figure
this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.190> perfect<00:00:17.520> example<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.060> show<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
how we want to be able to use this field

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580

with<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.779> rather<00:00:25.109> than<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.560> having<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
with it and rather than just having the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
with it and rather than just having the
trees<00:00:26.189> take<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> our<00:00:27.119> space<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.380> what

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
trees take up all of our space so what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
trees take up all of our space so what
you<00:00:28.650> need<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.369> obviously<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.359> want

trees now when you see these little red
squares<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> trees<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.860> still

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
squares you can see the trees are still

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
squares you can see the trees are still
there<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:44.969> those<00:00:45.149> at

this point so we're going to ahead and
hit<00:00:46.739> play<00:00:46.890> again<00:00:47.329> allowing<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> game<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
hit play again allowing the game to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020 
hit play again allowing the game to
refresh<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> comes<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.879> it's

that's going to do is we're going to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
that's going to do is we're going to
clear<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> plow<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.060> call<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> once

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
clear the plow is what they call it once

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
clear the plow is what they call it once
it's<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.920> ahead<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.310> delete<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.450> go

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it's down go ahead and delete it now go

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's down go ahead and delete it now go
get<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.200> plowing<00:01:17.189> tool<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.880> to

plow<00:01:23.759> before<00:01:24.320> we've<00:01:25.320> done<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.680> we've<00:01:25.830> cleared

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
plow before we've done is we've cleared

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
plow before we've done is we've cleared
the<00:01:26.369> plow<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.030> some<00:01:27.210> reason<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> glitch

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the plow for some reason it's a glitch

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
the plow for some reason it's a glitch
in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> game<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.130> basically<00:01:29.310> says

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
in the game that just basically says

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.460 
in the game that just basically says
okay<00:01:30.240> well<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.930> put<00:01:31.140> things<00:01:31.320> down

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
okay well now we can put things down

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
okay well now we can put things down
here<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:32.520> must<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.939> any<00:01:33.180> trees<00:01:33.479> here

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
here there must not be any trees here

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140 
here there must not be any trees here
anything<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.829> once<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.369> all<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:36.000> your

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
anything so once you get all of your

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:47.020 
anything so once you get all of your
plowed<00:01:36.450> area<00:01:36.869> down

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.910

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
you can see now that we have the entire

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.810 
you can see now that we have the entire
field<00:01:49.670> plowed<00:01:50.229> okay<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:52.490> go<00:01:52.670> ahead

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
field plowed okay and then we go ahead

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.700 
field plowed okay and then we go ahead
and<00:01:53.330> show<00:01:54.080> our<00:01:54.260> trees<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:57.080> see<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.500> that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
I'm still dealing on the same farm and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.639 
I'm still dealing on the same farm and
there's<00:02:02.210> all<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.450> our<00:02:02.659> trees<00:02:02.930> with<00:02:03.259> all<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.560> our

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
there's all of our trees with all of our

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.040 
there's all of our trees with all of our
plows<00:02:03.920> underneath<00:02:04.430> here<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.720> want<00:02:05.930> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
plows underneath here now if you want to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.650 
plows underneath here now if you want to
do<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.320> with<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:07.090> stacked<00:02:08.090> or<00:02:08.360> layered

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
do this with the stacked or layered

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.650 
do this with the stacked or layered
fields<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.069> exact<00:02:10.459> same<00:02:10.489> thing<00:02:11.030> by

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
fields you do the exact same thing by

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.720 
fields you do the exact same thing by
turning<00:02:11.720> off<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.170> trees<00:02:12.590> reloading<00:02:13.550> this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
turning off the trees reloading this

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.830 
turning off the trees reloading this
farm<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:15.080> starting<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.800> on<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> new<00:02:16.250> tab

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
farm and then starting up on a new tab

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.970 
farm and then starting up on a new tab
just<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.200> would<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:18.440> everything<00:02:18.709> else

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
just like you would do everything else

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.620 
just like you would do everything else
so<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.489> could<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.880> your<00:02:20.060> stacked<00:02:20.390> or

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
so you could have your stacked or

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.930 
so you could have your stacked or
layered<00:02:20.930> fields<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> same<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.880> you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
layered fields here just the same so you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520 
layered fields here just the same so you
can<00:02:23.239> pretend<00:02:23.570> like<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> trees<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.320> even

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
can pretend like the trees don't even

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.650 
can pretend like the trees don't even
exist<00:02:24.680> during<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.310> point<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.760> now<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.390> have

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
exist during that point and now you have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.420 
exist during that point and now you have
your<00:02:26.810> trees<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.769> your<00:02:28.190> plowed

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
