00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello to all today I practiced 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.720
 fishing cat fish being like 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.830
 everyone knows the catfish does not 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 not enjoy a very good 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
 reputation and this is justified because they 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 flow tz2 real imbalances in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 the ponds to which it is present it is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.230
 a fish that has no real 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 predators in our environments and by 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.619
 therefore multiply very 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.920
 quickly and very quickly colonized the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 middle at the expense of other species 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 today I'm going to give you a few 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.340
 tips to make this fishing more 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 fun because the catfish is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 fish that really does not attract 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.239
 many fishermen 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 it's true that it's a fishing 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.610
 tedious a very pungent fish that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 is really hard to pick up 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.129
 I will try to give you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 some tips to make this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.050
 really more fun fishing I practice 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 this fishing because I prefer like here 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 to combine the useful with the pleasant 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.989
 ridding the middle of these few 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.610
 unwanted fish and therefore 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.840
 I keep them all because it's a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 fish that is harmful so we can 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.100
 not put him back in the water and his fish 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 I use them to eat them because their 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.240
 flesh is really delicious for this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 peach 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 I use a number 8 hook up 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 directly on the line body and a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.900
 buckshot lead of 2 g pass to about 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 10 centimes 10 15 cm from the hook 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 then you put a grain of corn 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 you let the edge of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.780
 the grain hook 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.689
 and you place your line is here so 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.890
 to feel better the keys game uses 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.890
 a method like peach 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.880
 and that's a really, really 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.009
 simple that gives great results 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.619
 the problem with this fish is the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.270
 thorns the three thorns that are just 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.250
 behind the head and a have about 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.209
 middle of the back so that this fish does not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.729
 you do not sting your fingers 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.509
 wait until they calm down and you 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.600
 place thorns like this between your 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.880
 fingers so that even if he moves he does not 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.739
 can not wait for your fingers 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.900
 then you pick him up I hold the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.459
 wire always by hand like this so 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.380
 to feel better the keys as for 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.489
 catch fishing and forcing 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.489
 caught fish pop 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.709
 when you hold your son on the finger 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.060
 fish that prevents them from swallowing too much 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.950
 deeply what makes after his 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.940
 stall much more difficult for 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.380
 find more catfish 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.299
 easily I advise you to boot 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.579
 the little posts like here along the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.560
 low walls or just like here the london a 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.850
 tree that is in the shade settle down 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.329
 which are particularly 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.329
 catfish 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.550
 this is a really fun fishing 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.349
 which there is not much technique 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.110
 really special to develop 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.620
 it's a fish biting at about 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.620
 everything we offer him 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.890
 catfish being a species 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.360
 harmful that cause big 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.400
 imbalance in the ponds to which he 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.500
 is present we can not the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.240
 release the catfish 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.900
 the size of this one I keep them 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.900
 to eat them 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.700
 me that 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 this 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.850
 here is the fish a great map 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.230
 it's a shame that she has only one 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.480
 scales because otherwise it would be a 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.030
 leather see she just has a shell on 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.000
 the dollar really have a magnificent 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.990
 really a beautiful fish around 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.310
 three and a half pounds 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.310
 maybe four pounds
