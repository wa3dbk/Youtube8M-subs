until<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> few<00:00:05.490> years<00:00:05.609> ago<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.029> feel<00:00:06.359> like

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
until a few years ago I feel like

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.500 
until a few years ago I feel like
contouring<00:00:06.960> wasn't<00:00:07.410> even<00:00:07.649> really<00:00:07.979> a<00:00:08.129> thing<00:00:08.510> we

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
contouring wasn't even really a thing we

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.480 
contouring wasn't even really a thing we
just<00:00:09.719> kind<00:00:09.930> of<00:00:09.990> got<00:00:10.049> on<00:00:10.379> with<00:00:10.530> our<00:00:10.680> unconscious

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
just kind of got on with our unconscious

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.750 
just kind of got on with our unconscious
and<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.570> slobbered<00:00:12.990> bronzer<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.760> everyone

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
and you slobbered bronzer and everyone

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.320 
and you slobbered bronzer and everyone
was<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:14.939> the<00:00:15.180> wiser<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.949> contouring<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
was on the wiser but contouring is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.939 
was on the wiser but contouring is
massive<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.359> now<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:19.619> pretty<00:00:19.830> much

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
massive but now and I think pretty much

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
massive but now and I think pretty much
everybody<00:00:20.369> knows<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.470> its

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
everybody knows what it is and its

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.189 
everybody knows what it is and its
really<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.220> become<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.779> thing

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
really really become a kind of in thing

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
really really become a kind of in thing
in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.409> beauty<00:00:25.710> industry<00:00:25.740> every<00:00:26.310> company's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.649 
launching our contour products and i
think<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.119> lot<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.419> do<00:00:30.630> with

think you know it's a lot to do with

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.030 
think you know it's a lot to do with
people<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.019> kim<00:00:31.199> kardashian<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.859> kind

people like kim kardashian and that kind

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
people like kim kardashian and that kind
of<00:00:32.070> things<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> shown<00:00:33.150> their

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
of things that have kind of shown their

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.350 
of things that have kind of shown their
contouring<00:00:34.230> routine<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
contouring routine and kind of how it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.630 
contouring routine and kind of how it
can<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.900> really<00:00:37.140> transform<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> face<00:00:37.980> now

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
can really really transform the face now

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160 
can really really transform the face now
I<00:00:38.670> might<00:00:39.060> hear<00:00:39.210> its<00:00:39.300> talk<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.630> you<00:00:39.720> about<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I might hear its talk to you about the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
I might hear its talk to you about the
whole<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> Trump<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.430> what

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
whole kind of Trump you know what

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
whole kind of Trump you know what
triangle<00:00:42.150> under<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.540> prefer<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
triangle under the i prefer kind of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.710 
triangle under the i prefer kind of
in-depth<00:00:44.190> contouring<00:00:44.790> system<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.540> i

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
in-depth contouring system because i

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.330 
in-depth contouring system because i
think<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> type<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.740> contouring<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
think that's the type of contouring that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.890 
think that's the type of contouring that
looks<00:00:47.520> beautiful<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.360> pictures<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> looks

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
looks beautiful in pictures it looks

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.960 
looks beautiful in pictures it looks
really<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.620> sending<00:00:50.010> pictures<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.850> in

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
really really sending pictures but in

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.580 
really really sending pictures but in
real<00:00:51.180> life<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.870> look<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.170> very

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
real life can look very very

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
real life can look very very
over-the-top<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.790> overly<00:00:54.180> made-up<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
over-the-top and overly made-up and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.970 
over-the-top and overly made-up and
that's<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:54.990> something<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.470> like<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> real

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that's not something that I like in real

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's not something that I like in real
life<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.090> definitely<00:00:57.510> always<00:00:57.900> like<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
life but I definitely always like to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
life but I definitely always like to
have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.740> contour<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> spill<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.610> it's<00:00:59.790> not

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
have a contour and spill on it's not

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
have a contour and spill on it's not
kind<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> sound<00:01:00.540> like<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:00.990> know<00:01:01.080> I<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
kind of sound like you know I was in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340 
kind of sound like you know I was in
before<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.610> trend<00:01:02.880> but<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:04.170> always

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
before the trend but I have always

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
before the trend but I have always
wanted<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.400> caught<00:01:05.610> by<00:01:05.759> Ryan<00:01:05.939> face

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
wanted because I've caught by Ryan face

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750 
wanted because I've caught by Ryan face
some<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:06.780> might<00:01:06.900> disagree<00:01:07.400> there's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> big

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
some people might disagree there's a big

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
some people might disagree there's a big
debate<00:01:08.940> going<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.480> it<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.290> my

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
debate going on about it on one of my

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.100 
debate going on about it on one of my
videos<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.980> people<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.760> nuts<00:01:11.909> over<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.870> um

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I have got a round face and I just like

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
I have got a round face and I just like
it's<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.260> her<00:01:16.470> cheekbones<00:01:16.980> look

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's kind of I like her cheekbones look

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's kind of I like her cheekbones look
I<00:01:17.370> like<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.580> face<00:01:17.850> I've<00:01:18.060> got<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> cheek<00:01:18.540> bones

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I like a face I've got the cheek bones

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
I like a face I've got the cheek bones
in<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> feel<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.310> face<00:01:20.520> needs<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
in it so I feel like my face needs a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.980 
in it so I feel like my face needs a
little<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> help<00:01:21.420> achieving<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little bit of help achieving that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
little bit of help achieving that
especially<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> moment<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
especially at the moment because it is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.170 
especially at the moment because it is
so<00:01:23.909> rank<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.990> really<00:01:28.580> rely<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:29.760> contouring

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
so rank so I really rely on contouring

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
so rank so I really rely on contouring
and<00:01:30.390> contour<00:01:30.690> pretty<00:01:30.900> much<00:01:31.020> every<00:01:31.320> day<00:01:31.440> if<00:01:31.500> I'm

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and contour pretty much every day if I'm

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.680 
and contour pretty much every day if I'm
wearing<00:01:31.890> makeup<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> think<00:01:33.180> Jing<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
wearing makeup but I think Jing in a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.630 
wearing makeup but I think Jing in a
subtle<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.470> using<00:01:34.770> subtle<00:01:35.130> products<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
subtle way and using subtle products is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.070 
subtle way and using subtle products is
the<00:01:35.790> way<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.570> need<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.870> kind<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
the way to go you don't need to kind of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.270 
the way to go you don't need to kind of
be<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> top<00:01:37.830> with<00:01:38.159> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
corpore it looks like this it looks

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.330 
corpore it looks like this it looks
really<00:02:36.900> scary<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.740> came<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> post

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
really scary when this came in the post

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.810 
really scary when this came in the post
I<00:02:38.640> looked<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.300> thought<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:41.489> tone<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
I looked at it my thought the tone of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.520 
I looked at it my thought the tone of
this<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.300> odd<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.410> with

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
this is odd because I think with

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.160 
this is odd because I think with
contours<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.130> tend<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.850> work<00:02:45.600> better<00:02:45.870> if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
contours they tend to work better if

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
contours they tend to work better if
they're<00:02:46.380> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> color<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.160> shadows

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
they're kind of the color of shadows

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.520 
they're kind of the color of shadows
that<00:02:47.700> they<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.360> slightly<00:02:48.750> cool<00:02:49.050> little<00:02:49.350> I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that they have a slightly cool little I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.229 
that they have a slightly cool little I
don't<00:02:49.709> necessarily<00:02:49.830> think<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.580> gray<00:02:50.820> ones

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
don't necessarily think the gray ones

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.590 
don't necessarily think the gray ones
work<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:53.150> everyone's<00:02:54.150> skin<00:02:54.390> tone

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
work that well on everyone's skin tone

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.500 
work that well on everyone's skin tone
but<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.080> fat<00:02:55.380> Tlakula<00:02:55.920> tone<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.550> bonds<00:02:56.970> tend<00:02:57.300> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
but a fat Tlakula tone and bonds tend to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
but a fat Tlakula tone and bonds tend to
work<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.989> thought<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:58.530> really

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
work well and I thought it's just really

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.760 
work well and I thought it's just really
really<00:02:59.489> orange<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.330> swap<00:03:00.930> them<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.380> my<00:03:01.560> hand

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
really orange I swap them back my hand

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.220 
really orange I swap them back my hand
there<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.400> looked<00:03:02.610> too<00:03:02.850> warm<00:03:03.180> two<00:03:03.750> lines<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
there it looked too warm two lines I

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.110 
there it looked too warm two lines I

works<00:04:45.130> really<00:04:45.460> well<00:04:45.580> that's<00:04:45.880> what<00:04:46.030> I

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
works really well that's what I

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.240 
works really well that's what I
sometimes<00:04:46.660> doing<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.080> nua<00:04:47.530> one's<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:48.070> great

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
sometimes doing this nua one's a great

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.310 
sometimes doing this nua one's a great
example<00:04:48.460> this<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:48.789> jade<00:04:49.060> number<00:04:49.300> three<00:04:49.570> this

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
example this is jade number three this

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.930 
example this is jade number three this
is<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.740> really<00:04:50.860> nice<00:04:51.100> contour<00:04:51.370> shade<00:04:51.789> I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
is just a really nice contour shade I

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.550 
is just a really nice contour shade I
can<00:04:52.300> wear<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.630> slightly<00:04:52.900> warmer<00:04:53.380> tone

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
can wear the slightly warmer tone

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.409 
can wear the slightly warmer tone
because<00:04:53.949> my<00:04:54.070> skin<00:04:54.310> tone<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.610> slightly<00:04:55.000> warmer

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
because my skin tone is slightly warmer

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.300 
because my skin tone is slightly warmer
if<00:04:55.780> you've<00:04:56.020> got<00:04:56.199> cooler<00:04:56.500> toe<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.130> just

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
if you've got cooler toe and then just

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.830 
if you've got cooler toe and then just
look<00:04:57.490> for<00:04:57.669> something<00:04:57.699> kind<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.449> a<00:04:58.510> little<00:04:58.720> bit

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
look for something kind of a little bit

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.529 
look for something kind of a little bit
more<00:04:59.039> ashy<00:05:00.039> almost<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.270> should<00:05:01.419> work

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
more ashy almost and that should work

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.600 
more ashy almost and that should work
well<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.020> pounders<00:05:02.440> all<00:05:02.740> with<00:05:02.979> Matt<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:03.460> that

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
well but pounders all with Matt so that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.719 
well but pounders all with Matt so that
works<00:05:03.789> great<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:05.770> for<00:05:06.340> little

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
works great and then for little

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.000 
works great and then for little
contouring<00:05:07.240> kits<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:07.990> pallets<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.770> all<00:05:08.860> that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
to why they think that it's really a

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.770 
to why they think that it's really a
great<00:06:12.340> comment<00:06:12.729> or<00:06:12.849> product<00:06:13.150> because<00:06:13.389> the

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
great comment or product because the

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.050 
great comment or product because the
highlighter<00:06:14.260> is<00:06:14.590> gorgeous<00:06:15.130> not<00:06:15.550> very<00:06:15.789> subtle

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
highlighter is gorgeous not very subtle

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.000 
highlighter is gorgeous not very subtle
at<00:06:16.539> all<00:06:16.720> it's<00:06:16.990> kind<00:06:17.169> of<00:06:17.199> a<00:06:17.289> peachy<00:06:17.680> shimmery

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
at all it's kind of a peachy shimmery

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.040 
at all it's kind of a peachy shimmery
color<00:06:18.220> but<00:06:18.400> very<00:06:18.610> pretty<00:06:18.909> and<00:06:19.120> then<00:06:19.599> this<00:06:19.990> one

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
color but very pretty and then this one

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.980 
color but very pretty and then this one
I<00:06:20.650> think<00:06:21.220> it's<00:06:21.490> both<00:06:21.849> feet<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.300> bronzer<00:06:22.780> and

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
I think it's both feet the bronzer and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.469 
I think it's both feet the bronzer and
the<00:06:23.169> contour<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.860> wouldn't<00:06:24.760> contour<00:06:25.210> with<00:06:25.360> that

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
the contour I wouldn't contour with that

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:26.300 
the contour I wouldn't contour with that
I<00:06:25.510> think<00:06:25.659> it's<00:06:25.990> just

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
I think it's just

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.310 
I think it's just
little<00:06:26.550> bit<00:06:26.700> to<00:06:26.910> kind<00:06:27.300> of<00:06:27.330> bronzy<00:06:27.840> a<00:06:27.870> little

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
little bit to kind of bronzy a little

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.970 
little bit to kind of bronzy a little
bit<00:06:28.410> to<00:06:28.590> oranjee<00:06:29.840> for<00:06:30.840> my<00:06:30.990> liking<00:06:31.260> works

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
wouldn't recommend it but it's kind of

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.010

scrubs shimmery highlighter and then the
bird<00:06:48.810> guess<00:06:49.230> when<00:06:49.440> I<00:06:49.470> picked<00:06:49.680> up<00:06:49.830> was<00:06:50.040> the

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
bird guess when I picked up was the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.420 
bird guess when I picked up was the
Maybelline<00:06:51.240> master<00:06:51.660> gulps<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:52.860> I've<00:06:53.040> got<00:06:53.280> it

Maybelline master gulps and I've got it

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.220 
Maybelline master gulps and I've got it
in<00:06:53.550> like<00:06:53.730> medium<00:06:54.150> again<00:06:54.450> because<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:55.020> other

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
in like medium again because the other

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.410 
in like medium again because the other
one<00:06:55.410> looks<00:06:55.950> a<00:06:56.070> little<00:06:56.220> bit<00:06:56.520> dog<00:06:56.730> for<00:06:57.120> me<00:06:57.240> I

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
one looks a little bit dog for me I

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.300 
one looks a little bit dog for me I
don't<00:06:58.170> like<00:06:58.290> a<00:06:58.410> really<00:06:58.650> kind<00:06:58.770> of<00:06:58.890> obvious

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
don't like a really kind of obvious

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.370 
don't like a really kind of obvious
contour<00:06:59.790> as<00:06:59.880> well<00:07:00.030> and<00:07:00.300> this<00:07:00.750> is<00:07:00.960> in<00:07:01.110> like<00:07:01.260> I

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
contour as well and this is in like I

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.310 
contour as well and this is in like I
said<00:07:01.590> light<00:07:02.580> right<00:07:03.240> medium<00:07:03.660> and<00:07:03.930> it<00:07:04.140> looks

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
said light right medium and it looks

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.170 
said light right medium and it looks
like<00:07:04.440> this<00:07:04.890> the<00:07:05.250> packaging<00:07:05.670> of<00:07:05.760> it's<00:07:05.910> quite

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
like this the packaging of it's quite

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.690 
like this the packaging of it's quite
interesting<00:07:06.800> so<00:07:07.800> you<00:07:07.890> just<00:07:08.040> get<00:07:08.220> the<00:07:08.310> contour

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
interesting so you just get the contour

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700 
interesting so you just get the contour
the<00:07:08.880> highlight<00:07:09.270> and<00:07:09.540> then<00:07:09.660> I<00:07:09.870> think<00:07:10.230> will

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
the highlight and then I think will

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.590 
the highlight and then I think will
mirror<00:07:10.950> the<00:07:11.040> back<00:07:11.340> cement<00:07:11.730> little<00:07:12.030> brush<00:07:12.330> that

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 
mirror the back cement little brush that

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600 
mirror the back cement little brush that
they<00:07:12.720> suggest<00:07:13.080> you<00:07:13.200> contour<00:07:13.560> works<00:07:13.770> like<00:07:14.580> that

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
they suggest you contour works like that

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.130 
they suggest you contour works like that
which<00:07:14.880> I<00:07:14.970> could<00:07:15.120> see<00:07:15.240> how<00:07:15.450> it<00:07:15.570> could<00:07:15.720> work<00:07:15.750> but

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
which I could see how it could work but

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.630 
which I could see how it could work but
I've<00:07:16.410> shown<00:07:16.710> you<00:07:16.740> that<00:07:17.070> I<00:07:17.130> just<00:07:17.310> use<00:07:17.430> an<00:07:17.550> angled

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.640 
I've shown you that I just use an angled

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.960 
I've shown you that I just use an angled
brush<00:07:18.350> but<00:07:19.350> I<00:07:19.380> really<00:07:19.710> like<00:07:19.860> this<00:07:20.100> the<00:07:20.580> contour

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
brush but I really like this the contour

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.730 
brush but I really like this the contour
shade<00:07:21.180> is<00:07:21.270> really<00:07:21.600> nice<00:07:21.750> it's<00:07:22.200> kind<00:07:22.470> of<00:07:22.560> nice

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
shade is really nice it's kind of nice

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.100 
shade is really nice it's kind of nice
and<00:07:22.950> neutral<00:07:23.220> enough<00:07:23.700> I've<00:07:24.210> got<00:07:24.420> this<00:07:24.570> on<00:07:24.780> over

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
and neutral enough I've got this on over

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.570 
and neutral enough I've got this on over
the<00:07:25.410> clinic<00:07:25.770> one<00:07:25.980> today<00:07:26.160> which<00:07:26.370> I<00:07:26.520> do

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
the clinic one today which I do

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.130 
the clinic one today which I do
sometimes<00:07:26.880> and<00:07:27.450> I<00:07:27.510> think<00:07:27.690> it<00:07:27.780> looks<00:07:27.930> really

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.140 
sometimes and I think it looks really

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.810 
sometimes and I think it looks really
really<00:07:28.380> pretty<00:07:28.560> I've<00:07:29.220> got<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.460> highlights

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
really pretty I've got the highlights

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.070 
really pretty I've got the highlights
one<00:07:29.970> as<00:07:30.120> well<00:07:30.240> I'm<00:07:30.360> not<00:07:30.480> sure<00:07:30.660> how<00:07:30.780> all<00:07:30.930> that

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 
one as well I'm not sure how all that

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.450 
one as well I'm not sure how all that
shows<00:07:31.260> up<00:07:31.440> it's<00:07:31.590> a<00:07:31.650> very<00:07:31.860> subtle<00:07:32.040> how<00:07:32.280> about

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
shows up it's a very subtle how about

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.860 
shows up it's a very subtle how about
which<00:07:32.580> is<00:07:32.610> nice<00:07:32.880> video<00:07:33.240> in<00:07:33.360> the<00:07:33.480> day<00:07:33.600> but<00:07:33.660> this

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
which is nice video in the day but this
