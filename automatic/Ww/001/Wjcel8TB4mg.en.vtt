00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.330 

alright<00:00:04.210> continuing<00:00:04.860> we're<00:00:05.860> going<00:00:06.069> to<00:00:06.160> look

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.340 
alright continuing we're going to look

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.509 
alright continuing we're going to look
at<00:00:06.490> how<00:00:06.670> to<00:00:06.730> order<00:00:07.180> real<00:00:07.930> numbers<00:00:08.500> all<00:00:09.040> real

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 
at how to order real numbers all real

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.940 
at how to order real numbers all real
numbers<00:00:09.970> not<00:00:10.150> just<00:00:10.210> rational<00:00:10.930> numbers<00:00:11.380> but

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
numbers not just rational numbers but

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.160 
numbers not just rational numbers but
all<00:00:12.219> real<00:00:12.610> numbers<00:00:13.179> so<00:00:13.389> let's<00:00:13.599> see<00:00:13.750> how<00:00:13.839> to<00:00:13.900> do

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
all real numbers so let's see how to do

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.550 
all real numbers so let's see how to do
that<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.890> they're<00:00:18.730> given<00:00:19.510> any<00:00:19.779> two<00:00:20.230> real

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
that so they're given any two real

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.120 
that so they're given any two real
numbers<00:00:21.390> either<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:23.320> are<00:00:23.500> equal<00:00:23.920> to<00:00:23.949> each

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
numbers either they are equal to each

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.490 
numbers either they are equal to each
other<00:00:24.519> or<00:00:24.970> one<00:00:25.449> is<00:00:25.810> bigger<00:00:26.050> than<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.470> other

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
other or one is bigger than the other

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.339 
other or one is bigger than the other
this<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.640> called<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.090> trichotomy<00:00:28.869> property

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
this is called the trichotomy property

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.000 
this is called the trichotomy property
of<00:00:29.500> real<00:00:29.679> numbers<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.449> this<00:00:32.170> property<00:00:32.470> allows

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
of real numbers so this property allows

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.639 
of real numbers so this property allows
us<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.370> order<00:00:33.970> numbers<00:00:34.390> from<00:00:34.660> smallest<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
us to order numbers from smallest to

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.090 
us to order numbers from smallest to
largest<00:00:35.860> or<00:00:36.550> largest<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:37.390> smallest

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
largest or largest to smallest

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.670 
largest or largest to smallest
so<00:00:39.520> ascending<00:00:40.149> or<00:00:40.450> descending<00:00:40.530> order

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
so ascending or descending order

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680 
so ascending or descending order
descending<00:00:42.370> means<00:00:42.640> you're<00:00:43.180> going<00:00:43.390> from

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
descending means you're going from

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.069 
descending means you're going from
largest<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.289> smallest<00:00:45.329> ascending<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.870> means

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
largest to smallest ascending that means

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.520 
largest to smallest ascending that means
you're<00:00:47.200> going<00:00:47.440> from<00:00:47.680> smallest<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.309> largest

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you're going from smallest to largest

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.290 
you're going from smallest to largest
all<00:00:50.530> right<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:50.949> let's<00:00:51.489> say<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.699> want<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.059> order

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
all right so let's say I want to order

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.229 
all right so let's say I want to order
these<00:00:52.690> decimal<00:00:53.230> numbers<00:00:53.590> alright<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:55.059> if<00:00:55.180> you

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
these decimal numbers alright so if you

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.270 
these decimal numbers alright so if you
want<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.600> order<00:00:55.870> decimal<00:00:56.469> numbers<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:57.039> first

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
want to order decimal numbers the first

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.279 
want to order decimal numbers the first
thing<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.879> get<00:00:58.090> them<00:00:58.300> all<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.750> have<00:00:58.899> equal

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
thing is to get them all to have equal

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.380 
thing is to get them all to have equal
number<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.590> digits<00:01:00.070> so<00:01:00.789> if<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.000> look<00:01:01.180> right

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
number of digits so if you look right

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.900 
number of digits so if you look right
now<00:01:01.449> forty<00:01:02.410> five<00:01:02.649> point<00:01:02.890> sixty<00:01:03.399> nine<00:01:03.579> and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
now forty five point sixty nine and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.850 
now forty five point sixty nine and
three<00:01:04.360> point<00:01:04.629> four<00:01:04.870> they<00:01:05.110> do<00:01:05.170> not<00:01:05.440> have<00:01:05.650> the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
three point four they do not have the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.820 
three point four they do not have the
same<00:01:06.100> number<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.490> digits<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:08.350> all<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
same number of digits so in all the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.420 
same number of digits so in all the
missing<00:01:09.280> place<00:01:09.580> values<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.600> insert<00:01:11.080> zeros<00:01:11.430> so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
missing place values you insert zeros so

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.000 
missing place values you insert zeros so
that<00:01:12.640> they<00:01:12.790> all<00:01:12.970> have<00:01:13.330> four<00:01:13.750> digits<00:01:14.260> because

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
that they all have four digits because

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.440 
that they all have four digits because
that's<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.370> largest<00:01:15.640> number<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.030> digits

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
that's the largest number of digits

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.390 
that's the largest number of digits
across<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.050> number<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:17.830> two<00:01:18.040> three<00:01:18.070> four

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
across the number so one two three four

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.060 
across the number so one two three four
one<00:01:19.270> two<00:01:19.330> three<00:01:19.600> four<00:01:19.930> one<00:01:20.500> two<00:01:20.530> three<00:01:20.740> four

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
one two three four one two three four

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.590 
one two three four one two three four
one<00:01:21.610> two<00:01:21.670> three<00:01:21.940> four

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
one two three four

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.530 
one two three four
so<00:01:23.110> anyway<00:01:23.650> that<00:01:23.950> I<00:01:23.980> was<00:01:24.280> missing<00:01:24.580> a<00:01:24.940> digit<00:01:25.150> I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
so anyway that I was missing a digit I

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.040 
so anyway that I was missing a digit I
inserted<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.710> zero<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.250> its<00:01:27.400> place<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.540> now<00:01:28.750> look

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
inserted a zero in its place so now look

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.870 
inserted a zero in its place so now look
for<00:01:29.440> zero<00:01:30.370> two<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:30.970> 0<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.530> clearly<00:01:32.920> zero<00:01:33.550> is

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
for zero two and 0 so clearly zero is

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.390 
for zero two and 0 so clearly zero is
smaller<00:01:34.390> than<00:01:34.720> two<00:01:34.960> right<00:01:35.620> so<00:01:35.860> these<00:01:36.070> two

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
smaller than two right so these two

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.060 
smaller than two right so these two
numbers<00:01:36.760> will<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.270> be<00:01:37.390> switched<00:01:38.070> alright

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
numbers will have to be switched alright

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.730 
numbers will have to be switched alright
so<00:01:39.250> let's<00:01:39.460> do<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.510> start<00:01:40.900> with<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
so let's do that so you start with the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.850 
so let's do that so you start with the
largest<00:01:42.400> place<00:01:42.700> value<00:01:42.870> so<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.110> largest<00:01:44.650> place

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
largest place value so the largest place

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.680 
largest place value so the largest place
value<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.430> our<00:01:45.520> case<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.270> tenths<00:01:46.660> place

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
value in our case is the tenths place

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.170 
value in our case is the tenths place
right<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:48.220> we<00:01:48.310> start<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> tens<00:01:49.030> place

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
right so we start with the tens place

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.360 
right so we start with the tens place
and<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.720> look<00:01:49.990> at<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.290> largest<00:01:50.830> number<00:01:51.220> in

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
and you look at the largest number in

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.100 
and you look at the largest number in
the<00:01:51.490> tens<00:01:51.760> place<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.530> four<00:01:53.530> zero<00:01:54.520> two<00:01:55.110> zero

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
the tens place so four zero two zero

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.780 
the tens place so four zero two zero
four<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.650> in<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.860> largest<00:01:57.160> place<00:01:57.550> so<00:01:57.760> that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
four is in the largest place so that

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.870 
four is in the largest place so that
means<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.330> stay<00:01:58.540> up<00:01:58.660> here<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.430> here<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.790> have

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
means to stay up here but here we have

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.270 
means to stay up here but here we have
zero<00:02:01.210> here<00:02:01.960> we<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.320> two<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:02.770> these<00:02:03.010> two

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
zero here we have a two so these two

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.370 
zero here we have a two so these two
numbers<00:02:03.310> should<00:02:03.670> switch<00:02:04.120> alright<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.200> let's

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
numbers should switch alright so let's

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.290 
numbers should switch alright so let's
do<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:07.259> alright<00:02:08.259> once<00:02:08.560> you've<00:02:08.830> done<00:02:09.009> that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
do that alright once you've done that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140 
do that alright once you've done that
now<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.360> have<00:02:10.539> four<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.230> move<00:02:11.410> zero<00:02:11.890> zero<00:02:12.220> all

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
now we have four to move zero zero all

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
now we have four to move zero zero all
right<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.660> now<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.930> need<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.410> look<00:02:14.560> at<00:02:14.740> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
right but now we need to look at the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.320 
right but now we need to look at the
next<00:02:15.100> digit

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
next digit

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.750 
next digit
clearly<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:17.200> number<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.980> top<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:18.460> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
clearly this number is on top because it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.780 
clearly this number is on top because it
does<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:19.120> share<00:02:19.390> digits<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.080> anybody<00:02:20.470> else

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
does not share digits with anybody else

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.150 
does not share digits with anybody else
the<00:02:21.790> tens<00:02:22.060> place<00:02:22.180> digit<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.530> now<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:23.800> look<00:02:23.980> at

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the tens place digit so now we look at

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.760 
the tens place digit so now we look at
two<00:02:24.340> two<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.420> in<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.570> tens<00:02:25.660> place<00:02:25.990> here<00:02:26.620> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
two two is in the tens place here so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.400 
two two is in the tens place here so
that<00:02:27.460> also<00:02:27.820> stays<00:02:28.090> here<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.720> does<00:02:28.930> not<00:02:29.140> share

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that also stays here it does not share

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
that also stays here it does not share
it<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.800> anybody<00:02:30.040> else<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
it with anybody else and it's the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.810 
it with anybody else and it's the
largest<00:02:31.600> among<00:02:31.840> those<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:33.640> have

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
largest among those but here we have

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.560 
largest among those but here we have
zero<00:02:34.390> zero<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.280> highest<00:02:36.550> place<00:02:37.150> value

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
zero zero if the highest place value

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.260 
zero zero if the highest place value
digits<00:02:37.990> match<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:39.400> means<00:02:39.580> they<00:02:39.700> are<00:02:39.820> equal

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
digits match that means they are equal

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.200 
digits match that means they are equal
then<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.200> look<00:02:41.350> at<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> next<00:02:42.210> so

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
then you have to look at the next so

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.210 
then you have to look at the next so
here's<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.720> next<00:02:44.080> digit<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.830> unit's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
here's the next digit in the unit's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.570 
here's the next digit in the unit's
place<00:02:45.490> or<00:02:45.760> ones<00:02:46.150> place<00:02:46.540> we<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.160> unit's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
place or ones place we have the unit's

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.940 
place or ones place we have the unit's
place<00:02:48.730> here<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.300> three<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.290> unit's<00:02:50.710> place

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
place here is three the unit's place

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.770 
place here is three the unit's place
here<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.430> three<00:02:51.670> they<00:02:51.910> match<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.390> we<00:02:52.540> can't

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
here is three they match so we can't

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.199 
here is three they match so we can't
really<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.140> anything<00:02:53.170> there<00:02:53.800> let's<00:02:54.760> look<00:02:55.030> at

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
really do anything there let's look at

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.949 
really do anything there let's look at
the<00:02:55.480> tenths<00:02:56.020> place<00:02:56.400> they<00:02:57.400> both<00:02:57.670> share<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.360> four

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the tenths place they both share a four

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.260 
the tenths place they both share a four
in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> tenths<00:02:59.709> place<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.640> keep<00:03:00.970> on

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
in the tenths place so you keep on

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.380 
in the tenths place so you keep on
comparing<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.290> until<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.610> have<00:03:03.850> aligned

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
comparing them until you have aligned

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.150 
comparing them until you have aligned
all<00:03:04.630> your<00:03:04.780> numbers<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.350> way<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.560> want<00:03:05.950> them

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
all your numbers the way you want them

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.449 
all your numbers the way you want them
let's<00:03:07.000> look<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.510> next<00:03:07.720> digit<00:03:08.190> okay<00:03:09.190> here

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
let's look at the next digit okay here

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.230 
let's look at the next digit okay here
they<00:03:09.730> are<00:03:09.850> different<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.470> in<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.890> 100th<00:03:12.640> place

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
they are different so in the 100th place

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.140 
they are different so in the 100th place
here<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.410> zero<00:03:14.740> here<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:15.490> have<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> nine

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
here we have a zero here we have a nine

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.340 
here we have a zero here we have a nine
right<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.900> zero<00:03:17.260> nine<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.430> nine<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.540> bigger

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
right is zero nine so nine is bigger

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.610 
right is zero nine so nine is bigger
than<00:03:20.739> zero<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.489> we<00:03:21.610> need<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.910> switch<00:03:22.060> those<00:03:22.620> so

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
than zero so we need to switch those so

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.640 
than zero so we need to switch those so
switching<00:03:23.950> those<00:03:24.280> will<00:03:25.000> give<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.650> now

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
switching those will give you that now

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.800 
switching those will give you that now
there<00:03:26.920> are<00:03:27.070> no<00:03:27.220> more<00:03:27.489> digits<00:03:27.970> or<00:03:28.150> numbers<00:03:28.570> to

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
there are no more digits or numbers to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.560 
there are no more digits or numbers to
compare<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.890> now<00:03:30.130> we<00:03:30.190> have<00:03:30.580> our<00:03:30.880> numbers<00:03:31.360> from

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
compare so now we have our numbers from

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.340 
compare so now we have our numbers from
highest<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.260> lowest<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.790> take<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> look<00:03:34.330> oops<00:03:37.350> so

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
highest to lowest so take a look oops so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.110 
highest to lowest so take a look oops so
take<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.650> look<00:03:38.890> our<00:03:39.100> numbers<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:39.760> are<00:03:39.910> going

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
take a look our numbers then are going

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.840 
take a look our numbers then are going
to<00:03:40.209> be<00:03:40.330> forty<00:03:41.050> five<00:03:41.260> point<00:03:41.620> six<00:03:41.920> nine<00:03:42.070> twenty

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
to be forty five point six nine twenty

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880 
to be forty five point six nine twenty
three<00:03:43.060> point<00:03:43.420> four<00:03:43.750> three<00:03:44.200> point<00:03:44.560> four<00:03:44.860> nine

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
three point four three point four nine

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.560 
three point four three point four nine
three<00:03:45.640> point<00:03:46.000> four<00:03:46.300> highest<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.530> lowest

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
three point four highest to lowest

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.780 
three point four highest to lowest
alright<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.140> keep<00:03:50.470> make<00:03:51.040> sure<00:03:51.340> what's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
alright so you keep make sure what's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.910 
alright so you keep make sure what's
what<00:03:52.030> did<00:03:52.180> we<00:03:52.269> just<00:03:52.300> do<00:03:52.690> I'm<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.650> repeating

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
what did we just do I'm just repeating

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.220 
what did we just do I'm just repeating
the<00:03:54.130> step<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.730> understand<00:03:55.330> all<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
the step so you understand all the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.699 
the step so you understand all the
digits<00:03:56.620> should<00:03:57.489> have<00:03:58.080> something<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.290> them<00:03:59.530> so

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
digits should have something in them so

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.890 
digits should have something in them so
if<00:03:59.830> their<00:04:00.010> digit<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.519> missing<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.420> place<00:04:01.690> for

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
if their digit is missing in a place for

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.560 
if their digit is missing in a place for
you<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.260> add<00:04:02.470> zero<00:04:02.890> in<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.730> all<00:04:03.760> numbers

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
you you add zero in it so all numbers

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.550 
you you add zero in it so all numbers
have<00:04:04.840> equal<00:04:05.880> place<00:04:06.880> values<00:04:07.300> then<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.019> start

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
have equal place values then you start

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.270 
have equal place values then you start
comparing<00:04:08.980> from<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.090> leftmost<00:04:10.510> digit<00:04:11.470> which

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
comparing from the leftmost digit which

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.090 
comparing from the leftmost digit which
is<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.610> highest<00:04:12.850> place<00:04:13.450> value<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.769> start

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
is the highest place value and you start

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.210 
is the highest place value and you start
comparing<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.910> then<00:04:16.090> start<00:04:16.450> arranging<00:04:16.780> them

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
comparing and then start arranging them

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.070 
comparing and then start arranging them
alright<00:04:18.220> let's<00:04:18.400> take<00:04:18.519> another<00:04:18.669> example<00:04:19.080> what

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
alright let's take another example what

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.930 
alright let's take another example what
if<00:04:20.169> they<00:04:20.350> are<00:04:20.470> not<00:04:20.709> written<00:04:21.040> in<00:04:21.160> decimal<00:04:21.370> form

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
if they are not written in decimal form

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.300 
if they are not written in decimal form
they<00:04:22.120> are<00:04:22.150> written<00:04:22.390> in<00:04:22.600> fraction<00:04:23.110> form<00:04:23.310> well

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
they are written in fraction form well

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.580 
they are written in fraction form well
now<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.880> we<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.210> how<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.419> make<00:04:25.720> equivalent

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
now that we know how to make equivalent

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.970 
now that we know how to make equivalent
fractions<00:04:27.090> we<00:04:28.090> will<00:04:28.270> make<00:04:28.450> it

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
fractions we will make it

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.700 
fractions we will make it
infractions<00:04:29.730> for<00:04:30.480> all<00:04:30.660> four<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.290> numbers

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
infractions for all four of the numbers

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.760 
infractions for all four of the numbers
that<00:04:31.740> we<00:04:32.040> have<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.990> have<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.200> three<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.530> a

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
that we have so you have a three and a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.050 
that we have so you have a three and a
five<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.370> 15<00:04:35.940> will<00:04:36.240> be<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.890> common

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
five so 15 will be the common

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.490 
five so 15 will be the common
denominator<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.390> can<00:04:39.960> choose<00:04:40.170> any<00:04:40.410> number

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
denominator you can choose any number

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.860 
denominator you can choose any number
doesn't<00:04:41.160> have<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.640> five<00:04:41.910> just<00:04:42.420> so<00:04:42.630> that

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
doesn't have to be five just so that

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.980 
doesn't have to be five just so that
they<00:04:43.110> all<00:04:43.230> have<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.710> same<00:04:43.910> denominator<00:04:44.990> so

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
they all have the same denominator so

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.060 
they all have the same denominator so
you<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.350> 10<00:04:46.650> 15<00:04:47.180> 9/15<00:04:48.180> negative<00:04:49.140> 12<00:04:49.410> 15s

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
you have 10 15 9/15 negative 12 15s

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.420 
you have 10 15 9/15 negative 12 15s
negative<00:04:50.430> 5<00:04:50.670> 15<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.510> this<00:04:52.140> time<00:04:52.410> we<00:04:53.160> want<00:04:53.370> to

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
negative 5 15 and this time we want to

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.250 
negative 5 15 and this time we want to
arrange<00:04:53.910> them<00:04:54.210> in<00:04:54.360> ascending<00:04:54.780> order<00:04:55.140> so

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
arrange them in ascending order so

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.630 
arrange them in ascending order so
lowest<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.250> highest<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.500> our<00:04:58.680> numbers<00:04:59.160> written

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
lowest to highest so our numbers written

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.880 
lowest to highest so our numbers written
with<00:04:59.910> common<00:05:00.330> denominators<00:05:00.450> are<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.680> this

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
with common denominators are like this

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.530 
with common denominators are like this
now<00:05:02.660> take<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.690> look<00:05:04.160> so<00:05:05.160> when<00:05:05.550> we<00:05:05.970> write<00:05:06.330> our

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
now take a look so when we write our

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.870 
now take a look so when we write our
numbers<00:05:06.960> in<00:05:07.140> ascending<00:05:07.260> order<00:05:07.830> since<00:05:08.670> the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
numbers in ascending order since the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880 
numbers in ascending order since the
denominators<00:05:09.600> are<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.870> same<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.560> just<00:05:10.590> have

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
denominators are the same you just have

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.560 
denominators are the same you just have
to<00:05:11.040> line<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.670> numerator<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.270> we<00:05:12.480> have

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
to line up the numerator so we have

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.850 
to line up the numerator so we have
negative<00:05:12.750> 12<00:05:13.230> negative<00:05:13.670> 5<00:05:14.690> 9<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.230> 10<00:05:16.650> and

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
negative 12 negative 5 9 and 10 and

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.340 
negative 12 negative 5 9 and 10 and
that's<00:05:17.580> how<00:05:17.850> it's<00:05:18.060> going<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.300> look<00:05:18.390> then<00:05:18.660> you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
that's how it's going to look then you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.260 
that's how it's going to look then you
can<00:05:19.530> see<00:05:19.740> negative<00:05:20.190> 12<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.760> less<00:05:21.030> than

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
can see negative 12 is less than

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.770 
can see negative 12 is less than
negative<00:05:21.660> 5<00:05:21.840> why<00:05:22.110> is<00:05:22.170> that<00:05:22.850> because<00:05:23.850> owing

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
negative 5 why is that because owing

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.260 
negative 5 why is that because owing
somebody<00:05:25.050> $12<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.190> worse<00:05:26.430> than<00:05:27.060> knowing

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
somebody $12 is worse than knowing

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.560 
somebody $12 is worse than knowing
somebody<00:05:27.810> just<00:05:28.080> $5<00:05:28.740> right<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.790> when<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.390> think

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
somebody just $5 right so when you think

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.330 
somebody just $5 right so when you think
of<00:05:30.720> negative<00:05:31.140> numbers<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:31.830> can<00:05:32.010> think<00:05:32.250> of

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
of negative numbers you can think of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.540 
of negative numbers you can think of
them<00:05:32.580> as<00:05:32.880> debt<00:05:33.510> or<00:05:33.780> owning<00:05:34.200> something<00:05:34.680> that

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
them as debt or owning something that

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.920 
them as debt or owning something that
will<00:05:35.850> allow<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.650> order<00:05:37.650> them<00:05:37.860> properly

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
will allow you to order them properly

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.250 
will allow you to order them properly
all<00:05:39.930> right<00:05:40.110> let's<00:05:40.320> see<00:05:40.440> if<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:40.620> can<00:05:40.830> do<00:05:40.980> that

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
all right let's see if you can do that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.960 
all right let's see if you can do that
do<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.410> same<00:05:43.620> process<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.460> we<00:05:44.610> did<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
do the same process like we did in the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.030 
do the same process like we did in the
first<00:05:45.150> example<00:05:45.470> I'll<00:05:46.470> give<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.800> a<00:05:46.860> few

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
first example I'll give you a few

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.660 
first example I'll give you a few
moments<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:48.150> pause<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.720> video<00:05:48.960> here<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.560> see

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
moments so pause the video here and see

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:59.000 
moments so pause the video here and see
what<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.790> can<00:05:50.940> do<00:05:53.030> are<00:05:54.030> you<00:05:54.150> pausing<00:05:58.010> all

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
what you can do are you pausing all

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.500 
what you can do are you pausing all
right<00:05:59.160> assuming<00:05:59.280> you've<00:05:59.730> paused<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.300> come

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
right assuming you've paused and come

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.700 
right assuming you've paused and come
back<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:02.490> we<00:06:02.970> put<00:06:03.240> zeros<00:06:03.630> in<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:03.960> places<00:06:04.440> where

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
back so we put zeros in the places where

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.130 
back so we put zeros in the places where
necessary<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.810> then<00:06:07.490> order<00:06:08.490> them<00:06:08.870> negative<00:06:09.870> 4

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
necessary and then order them negative 4

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.980 
necessary and then order them negative 4
should<00:06:10.380> go<00:06:10.590> at<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.860> bottom<00:06:11.570> so<00:06:12.570> that<00:06:12.810> would<00:06:12.900> be

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
should go at the bottom so that would be

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.380 
should go at the bottom so that would be
my<00:06:13.140> first<00:06:13.350> number<00:06:13.700> so<00:06:14.700> let's<00:06:14.850> do<00:06:15.030> that

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
my first number so let's do that

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.560 
my first number so let's do that
and<00:06:15.710> then<00:06:16.710> we<00:06:16.920> have<00:06:17.130> everything<00:06:17.430> in<00:06:17.700> order<00:06:17.850> all

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
and then we have everything in order all

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.970 
and then we have everything in order all
right<00:06:18.690> so<00:06:18.900> then<00:06:19.050> let's<00:06:19.320> take<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.500> look<00:06:19.770> at<00:06:19.860> the

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
right so then let's take a look at the

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.660 
right so then let's take a look at the
next<00:06:20.250> digit<00:06:21.440> so<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:22.680> only<00:06:22.830> two<00:06:23.100> numbers<00:06:23.280> these

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
next digit so the only two numbers these

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.000 
next digit so the only two numbers these
two<00:06:23.910> are<00:06:23.970> already<00:06:24.060> in<00:06:24.330> place<00:06:24.570> but<00:06:25.350> these<00:06:25.710> two

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
two are already in place but these two

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.040 
two are already in place but these two
