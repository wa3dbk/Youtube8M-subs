how to get the most gold from the best

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.400 
how to get the most gold from the best
locations<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:25.700> I've<00:00:26.570> done<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> thorough<00:00:27.169> study

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
locations and I've done a thorough study

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.030 
locations and I've done a thorough study
on<00:00:27.950> this<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:28.460> taking<00:00:29.330> notes<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.869> every<00:00:30.650> quest

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
on this and taking notes of every quest

on this and taking notes of every quest
every<00:00:31.790> chest<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.480> also<00:00:33.200> every<00:00:33.710> tightened

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
every chest and also every tightened

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.910 
every chest and also every tightened
drop<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.640> I've<00:00:35.300> totaled<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.260> amounts<00:00:36.770> and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
drop and I've totaled the amounts and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
drop and I've totaled the amounts and
made<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.730> ratio<00:00:38.240> and<00:00:38.990> which<00:00:39.170> I'll<00:00:39.380> show<00:00:39.650> you<00:00:39.940> now

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
made a ratio and which I'll show you now

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.190 
made a ratio and which I'll show you now
I<00:00:41.270> look<00:00:41.900> at<00:00:42.079> ISA<00:00:42.410> first<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.690> you'll<00:00:44.690> see<00:00:44.960> that

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
I look at ISA first and you'll see that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.770 
I look at ISA first and you'll see that
she<00:00:45.620> has<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.280> best<00:00:46.520> capacity<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:47.630> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
she has the best capacity to get the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.770 
she has the best capacity to get the
most<00:00:47.960> gold<00:00:48.340> because<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.610> her<00:00:49.820> lockpick<00:00:50.360> skills

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
most gold because of her lockpick skills

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.260 
most gold because of her lockpick skills
where<00:00:51.290> she<00:00:51.470> can<00:00:51.650> open<00:00:51.800> small<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.700> medium

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
where she can open small and medium

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.110 
where she can open small and medium
chests<00:00:53.660> for<00:00:53.930> free<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.530> because<00:00:55.220> of<00:00:55.400> that<00:00:55.550> most

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
chests for free and because of that most

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.500 
chests for free and because of that most
people<00:00:56.570> have<00:00:56.750> grind<00:00:57.220> gold<00:00:58.220> with<00:00:58.610> her<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.090> so

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
people have grind gold with her and so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.990 
people have grind gold with her and so
her<00:00:59.810> awakening<00:01:00.200> is<00:01:00.620> higher<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.580> you'll<00:01:01.820> get

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
her awakening is higher so you'll get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.840 
her awakening is higher so you'll get
higher<00:01:02.360> Titan<00:01:02.900> drops<00:01:03.200> so<00:01:04.100> let's<00:01:04.339> look<00:01:04.580> at<00:01:04.729> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
higher Titan drops so let's look at the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.520 
higher Titan drops so let's look at the
results<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.840> sixth<00:01:06.229> place

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
results and in sixth place

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.359 
results and in sixth place
it's<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.280> plains<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.880> coop<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:09.439> gathered

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
it's the plains of coop and I gathered

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.420 
it's the plains of coop and I gathered
four<00:01:11.000> million<00:01:11.360> gold<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.020> then<00:01:12.470> five<00:01:12.799> Titans

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
four million gold and then five Titans

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.660 
four million gold and then five Titans
which<00:01:14.240> equals<00:01:15.020> eight<00:01:15.439> hundred<00:01:15.979> thousand<00:01:16.460> gold

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
which equals eight hundred thousand gold

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.380 
which equals eight hundred thousand gold
a<00:01:16.909> Titan<00:01:17.479> as<00:01:17.749> a<00:01:17.829> ratio<00:01:18.829> and<00:01:19.429> that's<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.210> way<00:01:20.359> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
a Titan as a ratio and that's a way to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.499 
a Titan as a ratio and that's a way to
compare<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.109> different<00:01:22.009> locations<00:01:22.509> so

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
compare the different locations so

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.419 
compare the different locations so
looking<00:01:24.020> at<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.229> pinnacle<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.799> was<00:01:25.130> fifth

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
looking at the pinnacle that was fifth

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.849 
looking at the pinnacle that was fifth
place<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:26.090> got<00:01:26.359> nine<00:01:26.659> million<00:01:26.929> gold<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.649> then

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
place I got nine million gold and then

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.370 
place I got nine million gold and then
nine<00:01:28.159> Titans<00:01:28.729> which<00:01:29.119> makes<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.689> million<00:01:30.109> per

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
nine Titans which makes a million per

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.520 
nine Titans which makes a million per
Titan<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.270> fourth<00:01:32.270> places<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.049> second

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
Titan and fourth places the second

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.010 
Titan and fourth places the second
deserts<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:34.429> it<00:01:34.850> worked<00:01:35.210> out<00:01:35.450> at<00:01:35.719> one<00:01:35.990> point

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
deserts and it worked out at one point

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.819 
deserts and it worked out at one point
two<00:01:36.590> million<00:01:36.829> gold<00:01:37.249> per<00:01:37.789> Titan<00:01:38.439> gems<00:01:39.439> more

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
two million gold per Titan gems more

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.700 
two million gold per Titan gems more
coming<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.429> at<00:01:40.609> third<00:01:40.909> place<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:41.710> 1.3

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
coming in at third place with 1.3

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.059 
coming in at third place with 1.3
million<00:01:43.009> gold<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.850> Titan<00:01:44.389> and<00:01:44.799> broken<00:01:45.799> tower

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
million gold a Titan and broken tower

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.370 
million gold a Titan and broken tower
second<00:01:46.759> place<00:01:46.969> with<00:01:47.329> one<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.749> half<00:01:47.990> million

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
second place with one and a half million

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.219 
second place with one and a half million
gold<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.950> Titan<00:01:49.399> but<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> first<00:01:50.509> place<00:01:50.840> was

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
gold to Titan but the first place was

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.099 
gold to Titan but the first place was
the<00:01:51.439> meatiest<00:01:51.950> Observatory<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.999> that<00:01:53.810> worked

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
the meatiest Observatory and that worked

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.879 
the meatiest Observatory and that worked
out<00:01:54.380> at<00:01:54.670> 1.7<00:01:55.670> million<00:01:55.909> gold<00:01:56.359> of<00:01:56.869> Titan<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.679> you

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
out at 1.7 million gold of Titan if you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.429 
out at 1.7 million gold of Titan if you
total<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.459> all<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.030> although<00:01:59.539> your<00:01:59.929> amounts

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
total it all and although your amounts

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.499 
total it all and although your amounts
will<00:02:00.619> be<00:02:00.770> different<00:02:01.249> it's<00:02:01.459> relative<00:02:02.119> so

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
will be different it's relative so

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.820 
will be different it's relative so
you'll<00:02:02.780> still<00:02:03.109> have<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.679> best<00:02:03.979> from<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
you'll still have the best from the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.999 
you'll still have the best from the
and<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.310> say<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.570> you'll<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.710> with

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
and I say so you'll see that with

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.580 
and I say so you'll see that with
Nietzsche's<00:02:09.520> there's<00:02:09.880> four<00:02:10.330> chests<00:02:10.930> and<00:02:11.050> 4

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
Nietzsche's there's four chests and 4

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.100 
Nietzsche's there's four chests and 4
Titans<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.210> definitely<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
Titans and you can definitely get the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.550 
Titans and you can definitely get the
most<00:02:14.320> gold<00:02:15.130> from<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.330> location<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.500> I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
most gold from this location as I

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.270 
most gold from this location as I
demonstrated<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.810> used<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.320> gold<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.860> Titan

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
demonstrated and I used a gold to Titan

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.850 
demonstrated and I used a gold to Titan
ratio<00:02:21.760> as<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.360> compare<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.170> locations

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
ratio as a way to compare the locations

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.450 
ratio as a way to compare the locations
even<00:02:24.580> though<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.330> total<00:02:25.570> was<00:02:26.200> from<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.160> chest

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
even though the total was from the chest

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.390 
even though the total was from the chest
as<00:02:27.730> well<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> Titan<00:02:29.050> drops<00:02:29.320> now<00:02:30.070> I'll<00:02:30.370> just

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
as well as the Titan drops now I'll just

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.880 
as well as the Titan drops now I'll just
point<00:02:30.820> out<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.600> broken<00:02:31.900> tower<00:02:32.380> if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
point out that with the broken tower if

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
point out that with the broken tower if
you<00:02:33.400> return<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.120> hideout<00:02:34.390> before<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you return to the hideout before the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
you return to the hideout before the
last<00:02:35.500> Titan<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.400> actually<00:02:36.970> gives<00:02:37.210> you<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
last Titan that actually gives you the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.320 
last Titan that actually gives you the
most<00:02:37.720> gold<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.380> worked<00:02:38.830> out<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.340> me<00:02:39.460> at<00:02:39.610> 1.8

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
most gold it worked out for me at 1.8

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.260 
most gold it worked out for me at 1.8
million<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.930> Titan<00:02:41.380> but<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.250> won't<00:02:42.520> go<00:02:42.820> up<00:02:43.000> in

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
million a Titan but you won't go up in

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.750 
million a Titan but you won't go up in
awakening<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.770> if<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.340> want<00:02:45.550> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
awakening so if you don't want to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.060 
awakening so if you don't want to
increase<00:02:46.150> your<00:02:46.209> awakenings<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.560> broken

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
increase your awakenings the broken

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.100 
increase your awakenings the broken
tower<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.580> actually<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> better<00:02:49.450> place<00:02:49.780> if

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
tower is actually the better place if

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.550 
tower is actually the better place if
you<00:02:50.590> go<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.400> hideout<00:02:51.880> before<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:53.200> defeat

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
you go to the hideout before you defeat

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.610 
you go to the hideout before you defeat
the<00:02:53.740> last<00:02:53.950> item<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.810> other<00:02:55.959> point<00:02:56.380> with

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the last item and the other point with

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.590 
the last item and the other point with
the<00:02:56.709> broken<00:02:57.130> tower<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.700> you're<00:02:58.000> prepared<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
the broken tower if you're prepared to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.900 
the broken tower if you're prepared to
pay<00:02:58.900> battleships<00:02:59.709> for<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> large<00:03:00.340> chests

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
pay battleships for the large chests

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.199 
pay battleships for the large chests
then<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.020> defeat<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.650> last<00:03:02.800> Titan<00:03:03.459> then

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
then if you defeat the last Titan then

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.960 
then if you defeat the last Titan then
you'll<00:03:04.870> get<00:03:05.170> access<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> large<00:03:06.190> chest<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
you'll get access to a large chest and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.780 
you'll get access to a large chest and
that<00:03:07.270> is<00:03:07.510> actually<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.200> best<00:03:08.410> location<00:03:09.190> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that is actually the best location the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.650 
that is actually the best location the
gold<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.540> total<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:12.010> also<00:03:12.250> open<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.450> large

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
gold in total if you also open the large

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.530 
gold in total if you also open the large
chest<00:03:14.340> however<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:15.700> you're<00:03:15.970> not<00:03:16.000> going<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.360> pay

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
chest however if you're not going to pay

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.390 
chest however if you're not going to pay
battleships<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.680> want<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.980> increase<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
battleships and you want to increase the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.870 
battleships and you want to increase the
weight<00:03:18.760> means<00:03:19.090> then<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.870> medius<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.459> looking

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
weight means then it's medius so looking

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.870 
weight means then it's medius so looking
at<00:03:22.000> Syrus<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:22.989> he<00:03:23.410> has<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> low<00:03:23.950> awakening<00:03:24.700> and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
at Syrus now he has a low awakening and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.140 
at Syrus now he has a low awakening and
so<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.690> get<00:03:25.959> less<00:03:26.170> from<00:03:26.530> him<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.980> he<00:03:27.489> can't<00:03:27.790> open

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
so I get less from him and he can't open

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.199 
so I get less from him and he can't open
the<00:03:28.239> chest<00:03:28.600> for<00:03:29.290> free<00:03:29.560> however<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.030> do

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the chest for free however if you do

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.850 
the chest for free however if you do
want<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.510> grind<00:03:31.750> with<00:03:32.019> Syrus

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
want to grind with Syrus

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.370 
want to grind with Syrus
then<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.250> dark<00:03:33.519> Citadel<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.840> best<00:03:35.050> place

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
then the dark Citadel is the best place

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.640 
then the dark Citadel is the best place
for<00:03:35.410> him<00:03:35.830> there's<00:03:36.400> 6<00:03:36.760> chests<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.510> 10<00:03:37.959> Titans
