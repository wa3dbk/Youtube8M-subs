we start the process last year beginning
of<00:00:47.610> August<00:00:47.940> August<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.309> completed

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
of August August then it was completed

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.850

when August 6th of this year and you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.180 
when August 6th of this year and you
know<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> bottom<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.270> us<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.660 
know the bottom line I think for us is
practicing<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.489> teaching<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.149> guess<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
practicing and then teaching I guess the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
practicing and then teaching I guess the
perpetuation<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> tradition

perpetuation of the of the tradition
that's<00:01:05.100> really<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> goal<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's really the goal and to do that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's really the goal and to do that
any<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.360> started<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.400> 1982-83

piece of wood and you know not all of
the<00:04:49.250> wood<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.520> usable<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.830> builders<00:04:52.220> will

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
the wood is usable and the builders will

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.210 
the wood is usable and the builders will
usually<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.660> all<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:54.860> their<00:04:54.980> head

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
usually have all of that in their head

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.270 
usually have all of that in their head
and<00:04:55.820> once<00:04:56.000> they<00:04:56.120> see<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.360> piece<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.690> wood<00:04:57.280> they

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
and once they see the piece of wood they

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.700 
and once they see the piece of wood they
get<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:58.970> size<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.420> keel<00:04:59.720> measure<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
get the size of the keel measure the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.160 
get the size of the keel measure the
keel<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.820> wood<00:05:02.240> that's<00:05:02.360> good<00:05:02.630> for<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.900> keel

let's pass down from thousands of years
of<00:05:10.390> canoe<00:05:11.390> building<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.680> know<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:13.090> you

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
of canoe building and you know you you

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.200 
of canoe building and you know you you
have<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:15.530> formulate<00:05:16.100> your<00:05:16.160> plan<00:05:16.820> on<00:05:17.030> building

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
have to formulate your plan on building

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.210 
have to formulate your plan on building
the<00:05:17.420> canoe<00:05:17.990> according<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.560> your<00:05:18.710> materials

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
the canoe according to your materials

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.910 
the canoe according to your materials
available<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:20.500> traditionally<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.620> canoes

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
available and traditionally the canoes

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.860 
available and traditionally the canoes
are<00:05:22.070> composites<00:05:22.730> so<00:05:22.910> you<00:05:22.970> have<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.180> single<00:05:23.480> kill

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
are composites so you have a single kill

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.250 
are composites so you have a single kill
but<00:05:24.290> separate<00:05:24.650> file<00:05:24.860> pieces<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.810> like<00:05:26.810> reset

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
but separate file pieces and like reset

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.380

all<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.520> builders<00:05:28.880> head<00:05:29.120> and

all of that is of the builders head and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.930 
all of that is of the builders head and
so<00:05:29.870> he<00:05:30.200> conforms<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.070> materials<00:05:31.550> rather

so he conforms to the materials rather

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.490 
so he conforms to the materials rather
than<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.240> other<00:05:32.390> way<00:05:32.480> around<00:05:32.690> because<00:05:33.230> you

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
than the other way around because you

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.050 
than the other way around because you
can't<00:05:33.710> always<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:34.310> it<00:05:34.460> was<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.580> good<00:05:34.760> point<00:05:34.970> he

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
can't always and it was a good point he

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.360 
can't always and it was a good point he
made<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.390> can<00:05:35.510> always<00:05:35.780> find<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.860> materials

for the right conditions and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.710 
for the right conditions and
we<00:06:01.889> really<00:06:02.160> want<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.490> take<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.300> there<00:06:03.509> so<00:06:03.690> that

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
we really want to take it there so that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.110 
we really want to take it there so that
Manik<00:06:04.470> so<00:06:04.620> go<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.069> family<00:06:05.639> that<00:06:05.789> gave<00:06:05.910> us

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
the the wood can see it because we said

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.960 
the the wood can see it because we said
if<00:06:09.150> we<00:06:09.270> can<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:09.870> it's<00:06:10.199> Bosco<00:06:10.590> will<00:06:10.740> bring<00:06:11.009> the

it's<00:06:14.160> still<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.520> learning<00:06:15.270> process<00:06:15.660> even<00:06:15.990> for

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
it's still a learning process even for

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.719 
it's still a learning process even for
me<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.710> know<00:06:16.770> I've<00:06:16.830> done<00:06:16.979> a<00:06:17.039> lot<00:06:17.220> of<00:06:17.280> sailing

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
me you know I've done a lot of sailing

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.150 
me you know I've done a lot of sailing
but<00:06:18.229> especially<00:06:19.229> when<00:06:19.560> we<00:06:19.650> sail<00:06:19.889> with<00:06:20.069> the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
but especially when we sail with the

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.330 
but especially when we sail with the
guys<00:06:20.340> from<00:06:20.490> kilowatt<00:06:20.940> I'm<00:06:21.479> even<00:06:21.840> learning

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
guys from kilowatt I'm even learning

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.740 
guys from kilowatt I'm even learning
certain<00:06:23.340> techniques<00:06:23.819> and<00:06:24.000> I<00:06:24.060> either<00:06:24.180> for<00:06:24.569> God

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
certain techniques and I either for God

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.700 
certain techniques and I either for God
or<00:06:25.080> never<00:06:25.410> experienced<00:06:26.240> normally<00:06:27.240> so<00:06:27.449> for<00:06:28.319> ray

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
or never experienced normally so for ray

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.249 
or never experienced normally so for ray
and<00:06:28.919> I<00:06:28.979> were<00:06:29.190> still<00:06:29.550> students<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.750> learning

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
and I were still students and learning

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.159 
and I were still students and learning
them<00:06:31.440> but<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:32.729> know<00:06:32.849> we've<00:06:33.599> learned<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.990> lot

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
them but you know we've learned a lot
