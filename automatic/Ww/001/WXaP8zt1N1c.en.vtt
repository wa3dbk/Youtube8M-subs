00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.150
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.549
 new underwear for fan page and lots of data 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.270
 which made me say some cases for 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.949
 the sandwiches in the book you asked us to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.779
 tell you about a case that actually 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.789
 do not go too far to change the appearance 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 of the iPad and above all come 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 go too thick 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 that's why I started a little 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 internet search for various accessories 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 available on a committee on the website of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 coverstyle where I found this that is 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.120
 a case for the back of the sandwiches 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.219
 made of plastic lasts very long 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 thin that absolutely does not go to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.050
 thicken the device but that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.899
 obviously it protects it in the back and in the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 edges as you apply with this cover is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.079
 really very simple, very fine 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.100
 we already know it does not go so and so 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 here is the cover was put on the ipad 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 weight and thickness of the device not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 they are absolutely altered 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.619
 obviously the cover to a minimum thickness 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 which you can see here 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 but it is right that it should not be so otherwise 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.939
 it would protect ipad ming from bumps and falls 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.619
 accidental of course within the limits 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.390
 also in this cover thanks to a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 micro dentinho that you can see along i 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.000
 edges of the cover itself what it does succeeds 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.009
 to virtually protect the display of the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.780
 tablet when it is supported in this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.490
 way on a surface because thanks to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.439
 this is practically the dentinho 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 not a little display surface 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.229
 physically the surface where it comes from 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.869
 leaning 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 obviously all system buttons 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.479
 they are easily accessible see 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.060
 that of the volume is that of the block 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
 of the screen or news are reached 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.619
 without problems the camera is free 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.649
 free microphones in place you see you can 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.600
 easily reach the ignition is a 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.090
 ufe jack in low speaker and hollow 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 lightning are practically accessible 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.259
 as if it didn't exist 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.450
 I must say that this is the type of cover 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.140
 which I like better because it is the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 feeling 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.679
 when using the device with itself 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140
 there was no difference cover 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.300
 of that book or in short all the others 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.030
 even the smart cover that goes 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.129
 a little change also let's say the fish 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.840
 to the size of the device 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.090
 obviously I recommend you with this one 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.500
 cover to use a film for 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.260
 protect yourself otherwise yes 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.209
 risks scratching it without realizing it 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.799
 I bought the film it seemed 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.180
 coverstyle is as you can see from the 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.760
 bubbles studio have put a real one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.780
 crap but it does n't matter a little to the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.299
 hurry a little to get there 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.430
 videorecensione I am nursery nurseries 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.349
 I send you a hug I hope this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.709
 video was helpful to find the 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.780
 your ideal cover I found it and you 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.860
