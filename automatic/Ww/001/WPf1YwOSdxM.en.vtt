00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.450
 starting this video tutorial I would like 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.599
 tell you about temporary files right away 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.090
 temporary files take up a lot of space on 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 your computer because you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 open various sites see 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.029
 video and so on and all these files 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 downloaded to your computer 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.769
 some files are deleted after 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.859
 reloads some remain and how 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 time in this video lesson you can part 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 of files 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.219
 clean up on your computer immediately 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.290
 looking ahead what else is waiting for you video 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.450
 lesson with which you can still 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.660
 more clear files 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.399
 but we will understand right now about 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 standard windows tools so for 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 this go my computer click 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.300
 right click on drive c and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 choose Properties, and here once in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.930
 General tab, press the clear button 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 the disk after that happens small 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.059
 analysis that is, see how much 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 files can be deleted 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.640
 and how where and when it's you 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.470
 You will immediately see a small report 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 disk cleaning programs may free 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.990
 up to almost 5 gigabytes 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 but we have to check which ticks 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.159
 are worth then to accidentally remove the wrong 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.600
 what is needed and so temporary files 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.900
 internet we will leave here also 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 leave a tick here and skip it 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 temporary files are most important 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.200
 see 3 gigabytes 27 megabytes this 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 A lot of sketch sketches can be removed in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.920
 principle, you can not clear that is all 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 chapter temporary files pay 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 attention to this on so looked 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.810
 click ok message you will appear 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.000
 really want to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.509
 irreversible i will underline irreversibly 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.200
 delete these files yes i'm going to hit 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.630
 and the whole program automatically at once 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 deletes these files we wait when 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.099
 the program will completely remove 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.439
 little left because not much 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.260
 many files you may have 20 20 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:25.519
 gigabytes or 15 it will be longer 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.950
 click ok closing the window and back 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.720
 openable computer 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.480
 right mouse button properties 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.650
 what to see now how much 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.329
 retired or even stayed 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.090
 further we see that already 10 less written 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.780
 the number that is was almost 5 gigabytes 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.780
 now only half a gigabyte so 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.870
 view temporary files here are zero 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.579
 byte everything is fine click ok 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.700
 but not okay to cancel well as all further file 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.069
 ok 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.709
 that is, we cleaned these files now 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 we just retired from the computer 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.889
 from disk c 20 where we pressed right 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.040
 mouse click 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:18.739
 almost there are 2 with something gigabyte there are three 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.449
 something well 300 wiki size and just 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.720
 so removed it is very cool that is, we 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:26.209
 cleaned up your computer and so 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.489
 see the next lesson about how else 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.879
 you can free up space on your 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.879
 computer
