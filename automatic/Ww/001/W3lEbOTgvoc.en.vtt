00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.060 
grid I thought that was a guy over there
was<00:02:21.840> actually<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.500> their<00:02:22.620> body<00:02:22.860> and

we've been given off the grid which is

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.440 
we've been given off the grid which is
completely<00:02:25.890> useless<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.120> got<00:02:27.330> an

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
completely useless because we got an

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.410 
completely useless because we got an
answer<00:02:27.690> press<00:02:27.840> weapons<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.560> we're<00:02:28.800> hidden

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
here and my other perks are I believe

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.000 
here and my other perks are I believe
the<00:02:59.340> flashbang<00:02:59.850> resistant<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.010> gambler

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the flashbang resistant one and gambler

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410 
the flashbang resistant one and gambler
which<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.340> pretty<00:03:02.550> pointless<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.240> that

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
which is pretty pointless and that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.300 
which is pretty pointless and that
appears<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.200> random<00:03:04.740> care<00:03:04.920> package

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
appears there is a random care package

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.570 
appears there is a random care package
in<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.550> middle<00:03:05.700> with<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.810> helicopter<00:03:07.710> behind
