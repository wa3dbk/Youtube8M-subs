hello<00:00:00.930> Zach<00:00:01.290> mandu<00:00:01.650> through<00:00:01.829> if<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:02.040> bring<00:00:02.310> you

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hello Zach mandu through if I bring you

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.940 
hello Zach mandu through if I bring you
another<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:04.110> made<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.710> little

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
another video and today I made a little

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.039 
another video and today I made a little
something<00:00:05.400> well<00:00:05.670> huge<00:00:06.150> something<00:00:06.569> in

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
something well huge something in

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.290 
something well huge something in
Minecraft<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.429> made<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> Minecraft

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
Minecraft and I made a Minecraft

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.980 
Minecraft and I made a Minecraft
calculator<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.139> um<00:00:10.610> here<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:14.389> works<00:00:15.389> pretty

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
calculator so um here it is works pretty

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
calculator so um here it is works pretty
well<00:00:16.139> takes<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.680> little<00:00:16.770> bit<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.300> know

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
well takes a little bit for the you know

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.960 
well takes a little bit for the you know
calculating<00:00:19.199> everything<00:00:19.670> works<00:00:20.670> pretty<00:00:20.850> well

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
calculating everything works pretty well

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.470 
calculating everything works pretty well
I<00:00:22.460> just<00:00:23.460> kind<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:23.730> bored<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> had<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I just kind of got bored and had a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.400 
I just kind of got bored and had a
random<00:00:25.050> idea<00:00:26.390> I'd<00:00:27.390> seen<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:27.900> other<00:00:28.019> people's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
random idea I'd seen some other people's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540 
random idea I'd seen some other people's
stuff<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.130> YouTube<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:31.279> cited<00:00:32.279> two<00:00:32.399> might

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
stuff on YouTube and I cited two might

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
stuff on YouTube and I cited two might
as<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:32.790> try<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:34.770> didn't<00:00:34.950> look<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.160> any

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
as well try it and I didn't look at any

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
as well try it and I didn't look at any
like<00:00:35.430> tutorials<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.090> anything<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.420> figured<00:00:36.660> out

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
like tutorials or anything I figured out

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
like tutorials or anything I figured out
all<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.350> stuff<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:37.770> own<00:00:38.239> yeah<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> don't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
all this stuff on my own yeah I don't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
all this stuff on my own yeah I don't
watch<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> tour<00:00:40.320> else<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.890> started<00:00:41.190> make

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
watch the tour else I just started make

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.000 
watch the tour else I just started make
like<00:00:41.730> making<00:00:42.270> selfish<00:00:42.719> Donna<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> week

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like making selfish Donna about a week

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
like making selfish Donna about a week
ago<00:00:45.020> well<00:00:46.020> lag<00:00:46.770> hate<00:00:47.489> leg<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.690> i'll

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
ago well lag hate leg okay so I i'll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
ago well lag hate leg okay so I i'll
show<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> works<00:00:52.879> first<00:00:53.879> I'll<00:00:54.059> show

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
show you how it works first I'll show

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.580 
show you how it works first I'll show
you<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> lights<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:57.079> see<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.230> happens

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you how the lights work see what happens

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
you how the lights work see what happens
is<00:00:58.920> uh<00:00:58.949> whatever<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> hit<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:01.170> travels

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is uh whatever when you hit it travels

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
is uh whatever when you hit it travels
through<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.550> lights<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> ones

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
through here and it lights the ones

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
through here and it lights the ones
before<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> go

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
before it out up to so it has to go

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
before it out up to so it has to go
through<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> without<00:01:07.200> being<00:01:07.650> able<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> come

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
through that without being able to come

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
through that without being able to come
back<00:01:08.460> through<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
back through here so you have to have a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
back through here so you have to have a
repeater<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> work<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
repeater there for it to work as a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
repeater there for it to work as a
resistor<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:14.010> through

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
resistor also and I will come through

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
resistor also and I will come through
here<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.240> currents<00:01:16.140> inverted<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
here and the currents inverted so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.980 
here and the currents inverted so
usually<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> hit<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
usually they're off but when you hit the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
usually they're off but when you hit the
button<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.090> turns<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.930> redstone

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
button it's it's just turns the redstone

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.359 
button it's it's just turns the redstone
torches<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.860> does<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> same<00:01:26.220> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
torches on and it does the same with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
torches on and it does the same with
ball<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.250> more

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
ball so just this one use a lot more

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.950 
ball so just this one use a lot more
redstone<00:01:29.610> sand<00:01:30.090> used<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.420> around<00:01:30.600> further

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
redstone sand used to get around further

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.090 
redstone sand used to get around further
and<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> deal<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.290> current

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and what I have a deal is the current

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.920 
and what I have a deal is the current
travels<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:38.840> comes<00:01:39.840> through<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
travels up here comes through here and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
travels up here comes through here and
what<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.200> over<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.780> 25

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
what I have over here is just 25

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.950 
what I have over here is just 25
different<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.649> gates<00:01:50.270> free<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.540> amount<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
different and gates free the amount of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.940 
different and gates free the amount of
possible<00:01:52.590> outcomes<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.600> calculations<00:01:55.380> so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
possible outcomes of the calculations so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.300 
possible outcomes of the calculations so
um<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.490> hit<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.329> two<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.990> here's<00:01:58.829> two<00:01:59.100> plus

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
um I hit two and two so here's two plus

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.899 
um I hit two and two so here's two plus
two<00:01:59.340> right<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.890> when<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:02.070> gate<00:02:02.310> does<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.729> both

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
two right here when an gate does if both

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.109 
two right here when an gate does if both
of<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.479> true<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.350> it'll<00:02:05.119> execute

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of these are true then it'll execute

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.380 
of these are true then it'll execute
this<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.640> I'll<00:02:08.759> put<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> current

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this right here and I'll put a current

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
this right here and I'll put a current
out<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.530> let's<00:02:10.950> follow<00:02:11.160> this

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
out here so let's follow this

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.059 
out here so let's follow this
there's<00:02:12.819> 25<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.390> these<00:02:13.750> things<00:02:14.019> these<00:02:14.319> giant

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
there's 25 of these things these giant

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.410 
there's 25 of these things these giant
bridges<00:02:15.459> coming<00:02:15.760> over<00:02:15.879> here<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:19.269> can<00:02:19.299> see

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
bridges coming over here as you can see

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.740 
bridges coming over here as you can see
there's<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.840> lot<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.379> redstone
