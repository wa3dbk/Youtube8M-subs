00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
buzz about well the carbon fibers are

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
buzz about well the carbon fibers are
permanently<00:01:21.509> intentioned<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> the

unique visible rib geometry through the
taper<00:01:25.700> basically<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.880> means<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
taper basically this means that it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
taper basically this means that it
requires<00:01:27.689> less<00:01:28.020> effort<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> fibers
