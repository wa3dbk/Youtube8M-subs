00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.640 
desert dagger okay now let's talk about
the<00:01:31.430> gun<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.540> think<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:32.930> long<00:01:33.020> hard<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:33.500> this

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the gun and I think a long hard on this

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.620 
the gun and I think a long hard on this
because<00:01:33.800> I'm<00:01:33.980> like<00:01:34.100> go<00:01:34.250> on<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.430> handgun<00:01:34.850> or<00:01:35.480> not

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
because I'm like go on a handgun or not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.380 
because I'm like go on a handgun or not
I<00:01:35.990> almost<00:01:36.770> went<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:37.310> my<00:01:37.430> sig<00:01:37.880> here

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
I almost went with my sig here

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.910 
I almost went with my sig here
this<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.110> sig<00:01:39.320> p226<00:01:41.560> p226<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.740> leaved

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
this is the sig p226 p226 it leaved

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.160 
this is the sig p226 p226 it leaved
actually<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.730> this<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.000> about<00:01:44.180> safety<00:01:44.420> 226

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
actually so this is about safety 226

millimeter
would<00:01:50.570> be<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.690> great<00:01:50.960> weapon<00:01:51.230> for<00:01:51.260> carrying

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
would be a great weapon for carrying

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.210 
would be a great weapon for carrying
it's<00:01:51.950> good<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.280> close<00:01:52.460> range<00:01:52.790> it's<00:01:53.630> easy<00:01:53.840> to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
it's good for close range it's easy to

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.040 
it's good for close range it's easy to
use<00:01:55.220> on<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.550> run<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:56.360> would<00:01:56.540> probably<00:01:56.750> need

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
use on the run this would probably need

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.660 
use on the run this would probably need
my<00:01:57.170> first<00:01:57.380> choice<00:01:57.620> as<00:01:57.770> far<00:01:57.800> as<00:01:58.070> pistols<00:01:58.490> go

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
my first choice as far as pistols go

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.880 
my first choice as far as pistols go
it's<00:01:58.970> not<00:01:59.090> my<00:01:59.240> favorite<00:01:59.659> gun<00:01:59.900> but<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.620> one

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
it's not my favorite gun but it is one

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.500 
it's not my favorite gun but it is one
the<00:02:01.010> one<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.159> would<00:02:01.220> probably<00:02:01.430> choose<00:02:01.760> for<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
the one I would probably choose for the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.270 
the one I would probably choose for the
zombie<00:02:02.810> apocalypse<00:02:02.870> now<00:02:03.770> if<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.920> had<00:02:04.040> something

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
zombie apocalypse now if I had something

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.010 
zombie apocalypse now if I had something
that<00:02:04.430> was<00:02:04.670> polymer<00:02:05.120> 9-millimeter<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.810> might

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that was polymer 9-millimeter I might

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.570 
that was polymer 9-millimeter I might
choose<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.409> for<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:06.979> kind<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.400> situation

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
choose that for that kind of a situation

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
choose that for that kind of a situation
but<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.090> don't<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.319> then<00:02:09.440> again<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.709> might<00:02:09.769> not

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
but I don't but then again it might not

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.920 
but I don't but then again it might not
durability<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.280> steel<00:02:11.579> so<00:02:12.299> that<00:02:12.749> would<00:02:12.870> be

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
durability of the steel so that would be

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.179 
durability of the steel so that would be
my<00:02:13.049> choice<00:02:13.079> if<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.739> was<00:02:13.859> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> choose<00:02:14.099> a

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
my choice if I was going to choose a

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.280 
my choice if I was going to choose a
handgun<00:02:14.549> but<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.719> sake<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.989> video<00:02:16.109> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
handgun but for the sake of the video I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.209 
handgun but for the sake of the video I
