00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 new video of me and this time 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 with a new microphone 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 well that's not that direct headset 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.429
 and no classic stand nico 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
 phone but one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 Well it is microphone that can be 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 Any headphones build from it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.340
 to make a headset and talk here 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 from the duckling mod mike in the version 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.890
 2.0 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 that has arrived today with me 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
 and of course I wanted to go now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 trying to buy it was the thing 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 unfortunately not here why me that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.779
 had to import from the usa but that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.710
 was not really a problem I have 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.570
 now directly with the manufacturer 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 ordered me 30 euros including 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 shipping cost and was now after two 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.140
 Weeks without problems there so I was at 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.730
 inch stopped or something else na 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 yes and if you unpack that then receives 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 this stylish box here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.829
 and then you unpack them again 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 you get this very very simple 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 microphone 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.670
 it is really unspectacular indeed 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.160
 really just a microphone with 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 adequate long cable and so two clips 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.910
 gizmos with these clips things you can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.050
 That's easy on everyone 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.270
 mount headphones on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.719
 I have my super lux 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 this is a hd 681 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.080
 and just clicked on this page 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.180
 So or 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 it was first made this adhesive film and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 then a noob can get you to the side 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.479
 use it and with a magnet can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 you just put the microphone to this place 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.240
 then dock behind and easily 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 also at any time decrease again if you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 just want to have the headphones 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 this does not work without problems i 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 I'm super satisfied and that's what you are doing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 straight out like a fancy headset and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.829
 Of course, it works that way too 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 sound of the micro, I am direct 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.400
 I must say enthusiastic because I have 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.140
 Of course there are two other headsets here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 as always had my bed in the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 mx2 and my creator for pellets and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.189
 not 1 of them comes close to this 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 voice quality to it and therefore I am 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.340
 incredibly excited about it 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.049
 in my opinion therefore also 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.680
 definitely to record injured player too 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.540
 recommend 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.520
 Of course, the whole thing has 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.799
 one more drawback i do not know if 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 you hear it so well though, this is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.909
 Microphone by this high quality 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.340
 Similar to almost the big membrane 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.259
 very sensitive and very sensitive 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.570
 Although in this sense that you any 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.770
 record noise when I am now 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.719
 Just have a look on my table here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.970
 A little rum knock that will immediately with 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.869
 and of course you will 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.410
 also a bit of my space 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.060
 Hall 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.590
 because if I'm here now 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.120
 walk a little further into the room 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.720
 you will probably get some of that 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.250
 take 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240
 whether that is disturbing or not 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.980
 probably depends on yours 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.630
 Recording situation from but with me 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 the relatively large room in this here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.120
 Of course, that's the way it is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.490
 one thing 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.790
 to compare directly with the times 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.040
 her now in the following the mmx 2 as 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.570
 announced you hear here the mmx 2 of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 beyerdynamic in my opinion always 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.140
 still a very good microphone but im 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.570
 it's just not that clear 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.220
 dissolved like now the duckling microphone 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.750
 That's why I feel the duckling 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
 microphone as much better though 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.930
 as I said, it is also more sensitive 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.090
 because I am in the same now 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 like the hall and the room 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 it hardly stops here 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.850
 this microphone now if you can do that now 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 whole times directly in the price comparison must 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.520
 To say that borrowed me 30 euros 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.230
 tasted 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.380
 in combination with the super lux 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.990
 headphones it then 50 euros and for even 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.100
 this price is also the mmx 2 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.870
 the reason is in my opinion 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.220
 quite an alternative to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.200
 consider if you are not such a small one 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.850
 I would like to make my own headset 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.110
 find the sound of borrowing easy 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.600
 way better than anything i did 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.650
 far from similar microphones resp 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.650
 heard headsets
