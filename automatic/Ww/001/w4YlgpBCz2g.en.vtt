00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.700
 in this video we will also look at you 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.750
 several applications that are available with 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.570
 start screen 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.010
 it is clear that some of them are still theirs 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.029
 no on the start screen therefore 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.170
 offers to add 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:20.050
 go to all applications and add on 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.769
 start screen 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.769
 calculator also viewers 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.480
 and the alarm program now let's 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.840
 let's see how with these applications 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 I can start working with the application 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.809
 which is already on the start screen 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.140
 this weather app after installation 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.379
 the operating system in my weather 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 is demonstrated 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.840
 Moscow to change this business 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 I will go to this application and me 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.510
 asks if the program can 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.790
 weather use my location 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.050
 if i press the button to allow it 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.630
 means that the program will 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.180
 automatically detect my 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.920
 location and accordingly 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 take weather information 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.600
 based on this data how 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 the program will determine my 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 location is that everyone has 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.210
 computer that connects to the network 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 the Internet is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 ip address is a unique address 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 computer when working on the network therefore api 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.190
 the address is very easy to install. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 exactly the location of the computer is not that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.240
 so you can calculate so and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.660
 address right square 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.880
 meters but accurate to the city or even 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.010
 before the district in the city is quite real 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 determine your location therefore 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.870
 if we now allow you 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.550
 the program will try to detect my 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.800
 I look at the location that she is not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.560
 It turned out and therefore I am offered 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.630
 enter locations manually but probably 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 there was just some kind of temporary glitch 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 there is a button here that will allow us 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.560
 in forced mode again 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.780
 make the program define our 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 location presses this button and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.160
 Now the program has identified mine 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 location is absolutely right i am now 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.690
 I am in Pilsen 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.390
 Iâ€™m clicking on this city 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 confirm and now the information 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.200
 will be displayed 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.239
 it is in my town here as well as 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.519
 in the previously reviewed applications 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.650
 there is such a runner having paid which we 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.420
 can scroll 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.580
 information information this program 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 consists of several sections of this 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.140
 for example an hourly forecast map log 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.370
 weather and so on also we can 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.840
 go to 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.870
 Namu us section taking advantage 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.090
 button minus reducing all information 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.280
 up to such tiles here and choosing this tile 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.220
 which we are interested in is an example coming 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 just ski resorts and choose that resort 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.129
 for example, which we are interested in getting 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.069
 information about him closing the application 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.190
 weather and now let's reverse our 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.349
 attention to the next alarm clock this 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.599
 a program that allows us to start 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.849
 computer alarm clock and not one but 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.790
 they may be somewhat very simple 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.780
 application to start 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.299
 alarm clock just click on it 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.120
 further set the time using here 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.659
 there are such switches 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.370
 further install it will be a one-time 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.650
 alarm clock or it will be by day pick 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.739
 those days when it should work 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.989
 further select the call that is sound 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.060
 a signal that will be well, in general, all 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.069
 it's very simple here and when we all 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.930
 set up click save and 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.909
 respectively, so that the alarm clock worked 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.230
 But we need our device and our 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.150
 the computer was the key to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.530
 we can reset any alarm 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.480
 We can install several 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.090
 alarm clocks for this I press 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.959
 button with a plus sign, respectively, here 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.819
 can customize 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.879
 another alarm for example by day 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:03.239
 choose tuesday choose some other 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:06.150
 the call is not picked here and so and so is 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.040
 save it with this program all 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.230
 it is clear there is nothing complicated well 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.819
 if on the nuances as i said for 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.340
 to make the computer work 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.190
 The following application must be enabled. 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.500
 this application calculator is very simple 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.090
 the application here is nothing difficult for her 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.550
 standard engineering calculator 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 calculator with more solution extended 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.760
 functional and converter which us 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.250
 allows for example 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.199
 translate different units as 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.050
 for example, a unit of volume length and weight 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.780
 energy temperatures and so on to us 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.419
 here it is enough to choose for example 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.720
 temperature example degrees Kelvin and 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:47.160
 here indicate another unit 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.690
 r fahrenheit further we just enter 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.240
 how many degrees do we want and at the output 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.000
 we get the information very simple 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.010
 application and also it is very similar to 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.750
 standard calculator which is available 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.960
 on the desktop and the latest application 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.930
 which we will cover in this lesson is 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.850
 windows 8 viewer appeared 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.400
 special program for reading pdf 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.440
 there was no such program before 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.790
 so you had to download 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.490
 additional programs and 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.350
 accordingly use them and we 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.530
 you can click on the review button for 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.360
 order to find that folder on the computer 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.450
 where we have pdf-files and 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.400
 accordingly download and read them 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.410
 I specifically copied to the computer 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.230
 pdf document to open it 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.470
 in this program I choose this computer 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.900
 then go to disk d on disk d 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.270
 I have this document saved in my folder 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.190
 documents and here we are here 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.200
 I say open and now you see with me 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.940
 a pdf document opens in such 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.860
 viewer where I can read 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.810
 read its content here 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.050
 there is a simple tool which 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.940
 allows to reduce or increase the given 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.010
 go to some other page 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.340
 page and so on in general all 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.320
 just well the last application that 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.200
 I propose to consider in this video is 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.110
 card application this application has become 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.560
 original answer google maps service 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.500
 who developed google this 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.630
 by and large, their counterpart 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.820
 the functionality of this application is not very 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.520
 big you can big score 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:32.110
 increase decrease 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.810
 objects of interest on the map all 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.610
 information is taken from the internet therefore 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.560
 accordingly in order to 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.450
 view the whole thing you need 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.000
 internet connection because the whole 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.000
 this information is taken from the site benq
