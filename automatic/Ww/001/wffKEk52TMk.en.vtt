00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 It is very important that if you stay for 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.110
 inside everything that happens here in the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.689
 hairstyle for girls 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 good so you separate a wick from the part 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.520
 from the front makes a normal twig and goes 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.250
 start drawing as you take a wick 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.130
 from the top along with the side and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.920
 passes under the middle wick makes the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 same thing on the front takes a 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.789
 with the side and passes through the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.789
 down the middle strand 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.479
 the technique is this girls you always go 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.869
 would do if we get shines to join with 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.280
 and pass under the wick of the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.130
 half the same on the front 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.070
 handle together with the side and 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.109
 goes under the middle strand I go 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 put the video but soon like that 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.990
 because otherwise the technique is too long 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.200
 It's always the one you have to understand. 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.420
 You pick up some cookies along with the side 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.520
 passed under the middle wick to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.490
 Same thing on the top stone 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.310
 with the side and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.300
 under the middle table underneath the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.240
 because a braid in the middle 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.430
 inverted tinga because if you want 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.360
 make the braid normal what is the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.270
 difference 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.430
 girls the only difference is that you will 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.910
 pick up in china joined with the side and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.850
 go over the middle goal the braid 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.950
 you go over the top of the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.160
 middle goal and the built-in child 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.650
 inverted you go under the wick 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.630
 the middle is clear that at the beginning it will hurt 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.770
 a little your arm if you do 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.910
 yourself 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.890
 so you're going to have a little bit of 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.860
 difficulty but over time I guarantee the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.840
 you that you can if you do not 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.170
 you have nothing else to do 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.720
 determine there with a normal twig 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.300
 of the basic that everyone knows how to do 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.550
 and fasten with color silicone elastic 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.280
 of your hair is very important that the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 your hair is untangled first 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.720
 to untangle hair before 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.550
 make the braid now to look like 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.360
 with laura's I'll put those 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 candy-colored fruit straps such as 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.250
 laura wore it and I very much hope that you
