should help train your upper chest to

the bench press so rather than just make

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.040 
the bench press so rather than just make
the<00:03:25.030> upper<00:03:25.239> chest<00:03:25.480> stronger<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:25.959> more

bottom now the only safe way to do a
bench<00:04:17.200> press<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.979> make<00:04:18.130> sure<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.580> bar

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
bench press is to make sure that the bar

bench press is to make sure that the bar
is<00:04:19.229> below<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.410> nipple<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.890> is<00:04:20.979> either<00:04:21.099> at

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
is below the nipple so it is either at

the nipple line or lower and what you

they're tucked in even more but you will

bottom if the bar is low enough down
that's<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.729> easiest<00:04:43.030> solution<00:04:43.440> you're

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that's the easiest solution you're

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.870 
that's the easiest solution you're
flaring<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.890> elbows<00:04:45.190> out<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.550> bottom

flaring the elbows out of the bottom

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.390 
flaring the elbows out of the bottom
there's<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.750> ninety-nine<00:04:47.470> percent<00:04:47.680> chance<00:04:48.099> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
there's a ninety-nine percent chance the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.040 
there's a ninety-nine percent chance the
bar<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.700> too<00:04:48.880> high<00:04:49.030> up<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.300> your<00:04:49.450> chest<00:04:49.750> and

bar is too high up on your chest and
it's<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> same<00:04:50.890> with<00:04:51.250> dumbbells<00:04:51.640> it's<00:04:51.849> people

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
it's the same with dumbbells it's people

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.240 
it's the same with dumbbells it's people
who<00:04:52.180> are<00:04:52.330> turning<00:04:52.539> their<00:04:52.710> dumbbells<00:04:53.710> out<00:04:53.950> to

who are turning their dumbbells out to
90<00:04:54.789> degrees<00:04:54.910> like<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.570> who<00:04:56.560> are<00:04:56.590> hurting

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
90 degrees like this who are hurting

90 degrees like this who are hurting
their<00:04:57.070> shoulders<00:04:57.580> because<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.940> elbow<00:04:58.210> flare

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
their shoulders because of elbow flare

their shoulders because of elbow flare
at<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.599> bottom<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:59.020> need<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.289> have<00:04:59.500> the

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
at the bottom you need to have the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.310 
at the bottom you need to have the
dumbbells<00:05:00.520> supinated<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.330> bit<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:02.169> you<00:05:02.260> can

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
dumbbells supinated a bit so you can

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960 
dumbbells supinated a bit so you can
either<00:05:02.500> do<00:05:02.710> them<00:05:02.830> at<00:05:02.890> 45<00:05:03.370> or<00:05:03.580> even<00:05:03.729> all<00:05:03.849> the<00:05:03.880> way

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
either do them at 45 or even all the way

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.820 
either do them at 45 or even all the way
down<00:05:04.180> at<00:05:04.360> 90<00:05:04.720> for<00:05:04.900> your<00:05:05.020> chest<00:05:05.289> presses<00:05:05.680> it's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
down at 90 for your chest presses it's

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.550 
down at 90 for your chest presses it's
the<00:05:05.919> same<00:05:06.130> thing<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:07.479> has<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.990> do<00:05:08.140> with<00:05:08.320> hand

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
the same thing it has to do with hand

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.800 
the same thing it has to do with hand
position<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.340> power<00:05:09.820> position<00:05:10.419> more<00:05:10.660> than

anything<00:05:11.020> else<00:05:11.260> so<00:05:11.590> if<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.430> create<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:12.760> bar

anything else so if you create a bar

anything else so if you create a bar

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
path that makes it physically impossible

path that makes it physically impossible
for<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.430> flare<00:05:15.700> your<00:05:15.910> elbows<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:17.140> can't
