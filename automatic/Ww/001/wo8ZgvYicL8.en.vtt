00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
piece and just curl the pieces and then

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.569 
piece and just curl the pieces and then
spritz<00:01:47.779> it<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:48.289> it'll<00:01:48.439> hold<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:49.009> then<00:01:49.219> add<00:01:49.399> it

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
spritz it so it'll hold and then add it

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.929 
spritz it so it'll hold and then add it
with<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.819> rest<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.179> hair<00:01:50.349> maybe<00:01:51.429> if<00:01:52.429> that

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
with the rest of the hair maybe if that

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.569 
with the rest of the hair maybe if that
works<00:01:53.439> but<00:01:54.439> yeah<00:01:54.740> I'm<00:01:55.189> not<00:01:55.490> gonna<00:01:55.700> um<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:57.579> don't

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
works but yeah I'm not gonna um I don't

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.179 
works but yeah I'm not gonna um I don't
think<00:01:58.700> I'm<00:01:58.969> gonna<00:01:59.560> record<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.740> process

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
think I'm gonna record the process

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.989 
think I'm gonna record the process
because<00:02:01.729> I'm<00:02:01.939> not<00:02:02.179> doing<00:02:02.689> anything<00:02:03.999> different

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
that i had like a few months back it was

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.690 
that i had like a few months back it was
the<00:03:34.010> natural<00:03:34.760> curly<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:37.070> had<00:03:37.310> some<00:03:37.489> pieces

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
and then I think I end up using like

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.270 
and then I think I end up using like
another<00:03:41.930> two<00:03:42.200> pieces<00:03:42.560> from<00:03:42.709> her<00:03:42.830> hair<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.160> it

hair then glue the apart again chroma

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.460 
hair then glue the apart again chroma
here<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.270> forth<00:04:29.539> and<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.900> one<00:04:30.200> and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
here and so forth and so on one and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.460 
here and so forth and so on one and
that's<00:04:31.280> how<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.430> got<00:04:31.580> this<00:04:31.789> this<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.840> actually

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
that's how I got this this is actually

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.400 
that's how I got this this is actually
not<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
not the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.100 
not the
original<00:04:36.410> curl<00:04:36.740> pattern<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:38.420> hair<00:04:38.660> Jana

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
original curl pattern of the hair Jana

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.650 
original curl pattern of the hair Jana
Harris<00:04:39.590> its<00:04:40.190> natural<00:04:40.700> curly<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.210> it's<00:04:41.390> more

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
Harris its natural curly but it's more

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.170 
Harris its natural curly but it's more
of<00:04:41.720> like<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:42.230> tight<00:04:42.590> wave<00:04:42.920> instead<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:43.910> a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
of like a tight wave instead of like a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.390 
of like a tight wave instead of like a
spiral<00:04:45.140> curl<00:04:45.910> so<00:04:46.910> again<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:48.370> i<00:04:51.370> manipulated<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
spiral curl so again I i manipulated the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.460 
spiral curl so again I i manipulated the
Carlson<00:04:52.970> what<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.240> didn't<00:04:53.630> stray<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.110> didn't

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
Carlson what I didn't stray I didn't

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.590 
Carlson what I didn't stray I didn't
straighten<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> hair<00:04:54.950> at<00:04:55.070> all<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:55.760> i<00:04:56.030> just

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
straighten the hair at all but i just

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.630 
straighten the hair at all but i just
took<00:04:56.720> my<00:04:56.780> curlers<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.470> it's<00:04:57.980> like<00:04:58.370> it's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
took my curlers and it's like it's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.540 
took my curlers and it's like it's
natural<00:04:59.150> curly<00:05:00.020> stage<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.560> just<00:05:00.800> curled<00:05:01.430> a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
natural curly stage I just curled a

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.690 
natural curly stage I just curled a
regular<00:05:01.970> with<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.590> give<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.920> more<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.460> I

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
regular with that to give it more of a I

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.840 
regular with that to give it more of a I
don't<00:05:05.120> know<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.830> can't<00:05:06.830> explain<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.310> really<00:05:07.460> but
