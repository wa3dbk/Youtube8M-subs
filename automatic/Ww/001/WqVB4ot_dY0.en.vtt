00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
workout and also up through our back

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.059 
workout and also up through our back
because<00:02:32.599> that's<00:02:32.750> me<00:02:32.900> hop<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.799> have<00:02:33.950> to

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
because that's me hop we have to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.589 
because that's me hop we have to
stabilize<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.760> through<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> back<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
stabilize up through the back the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.530 
stabilize up through the back the
shoulders<00:02:35.989> next<00:02:36.860> thing<00:02:37.069> we<00:02:37.489> do<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:38.209> turn<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
shoulders next thing we do we turn it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.240 
shoulders next thing we do we turn it
right<00:02:38.659> around<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:40.459> pulled<00:02:41.049> on<00:02:42.049> our<00:02:42.230> hands<00:02:42.650> up

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
right around we pulled on our hands up

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.369 
right around we pulled on our hands up
on<00:02:43.519> our<00:02:43.640> toes<00:02:43.879> we're<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:44.720> sort<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.110> plank

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
on our toes we're in sort of a plank

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.910 
on our toes we're in sort of a plank
position<00:02:45.530> here<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:47.360> walk<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:47.810> out<00:02:47.930> okay

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
position here and we walk it out okay

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.580 
position here and we walk it out okay
savings<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.760> think<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.930> reverse<00:02:51.290> pattern

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
savings I think in a reverse pattern

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.520 
savings I think in a reverse pattern
that<00:02:51.860> we<00:02:51.980> did<00:02:52.190> with<00:02:52.549> our<00:02:52.640> legs<00:02:52.940> really<00:02:53.840> pushing

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that we did with our legs really pushing

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.170 
that we did with our legs really pushing
it<00:02:55.269> again<00:02:56.379> working<00:02:57.379> your<00:02:57.650> core<00:02:58.090> pushing<00:02:59.090> with

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
it again working your core pushing with

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.229 
it again working your core pushing with
your<00:02:59.299> upper<00:02:59.480> body<00:03:00.489> up<00:03:01.489> against<00:03:01.879> a<00:03:01.970> lot<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
your upper body up against a lot of

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.819 
your upper body up against a lot of
resistance<00:03:02.829> got<00:03:03.829> your<00:03:03.950> triceps<00:03:04.489> worked<00:03:04.790> in

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
resistance got your triceps worked in

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:15.399 
resistance got your triceps worked in
your<00:03:06.829> chest<00:03:12.069> okay<00:03:13.069> 30<00:03:13.549> seconds<00:03:14.000> then<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:15.140> drop

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
your chest okay 30 seconds then you drop

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.220 
your chest okay 30 seconds then you drop
it<00:03:15.620> down<00:03:15.799> now<00:03:16.659> we're<00:03:17.659> going<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> pull<00:03:18.109> the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
it down now we're going to pull the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.080 
it down now we're going to pull the
middle<00:03:18.379> towards<00:03:18.829> us<00:03:18.950> almost<00:03:19.640> like<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.790> lat

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
middle towards us almost like a lat

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.009 
middle towards us almost like a lat
pulldown

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
pulldown

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:35.370 
pulldown
so<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:22.370> arm<00:03:22.549> walks<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:23.000> down<00:03:31.150> good<00:03:32.150> reach<00:03:32.530> pull

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
so one arm walks it down good reach pull

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.650 
so one arm walks it down good reach pull
you<00:03:36.380> see<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:36.650> whole<00:03:36.829> back<00:03:37.069> working<00:03:37.660> good

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
you see your whole back working good

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.879 
you see your whole back working good
posture<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.380> don't<00:03:39.440> want<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.709> round

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
posture here you don't want to round

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:48.599 
posture here you don't want to round
your<00:03:40.069> back<00:03:46.120> okay<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.840> we're<00:03:47.989> working<00:03:48.109> push

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
work and pull we're really integrating a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.309 
work and pull we're really integrating a
lot<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.819> muscles<00:03:53.150> at<00:03:53.239> once<00:03:53.450> which<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.049> what

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
lot of muscles at once which is what

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.159 
lot of muscles at once which is what
athlean-x<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.459> all<00:03:55.579> about<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:56.959> need<00:03:57.139> a

treadmill a broken treadmill that to do
athleanx<00:04:00.530> no<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.209> is<00:04:02.359> just<00:04:02.510> integrating

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
athleanx no but this is just integrating

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.900 
athleanx no but this is just integrating
a<00:04:03.440> lot<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.799> principles<00:04:03.949> of<00:04:04.760> what

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
a lot of the principles of what

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.449 
a lot of the principles of what
athlean-x<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.449> all<00:04:05.569> about<00:04:05.840> being<00:04:06.349> able<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.709> get

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
athlean-x is all about being able to get

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.860 
athlean-x is all about being able to get
multiple<00:04:07.940> muscle<00:04:08.209> groups<00:04:08.239> working<00:04:08.599> together

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
multiple muscle groups working together

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.559 
multiple muscle groups working together
at<00:04:09.410> one<00:04:09.590> time<00:04:09.799> it's<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.609> function<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.150> stronger

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
at one time it's a function is stronger

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.599 
at one time it's a function is stronger
way<00:04:11.799> until<00:04:12.799> night<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.099> build<00:04:13.370> more<00:04:13.549> muscle

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
way until night you build more muscle

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.330 
way until night you build more muscle
Sam<00:04:14.329> last<00:04:15.109> gotta<00:04:15.410> eat<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.620> legs<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:16.160> come

generally don't train the hamstrings

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.430 
generally don't train the hamstrings
away<00:05:46.190> they<00:05:47.030> need<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.330> be<00:05:47.420> trained<00:05:47.750> which<00:05:48.230> is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
away they need to be trained which is

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.950 
away they need to be trained which is
closed<00:05:49.160> chain<00:05:49.490> so<00:05:49.760> again<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.360> lot<00:05:50.840> of
