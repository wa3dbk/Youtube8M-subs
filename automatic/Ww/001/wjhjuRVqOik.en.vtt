Montreal and Shanghai and that allows us

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.089 
Montreal and Shanghai and that allows us
to<00:00:22.869> really<00:00:22.930> do<00:00:23.230> things<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.649> we<00:00:23.739> wouldn't<00:00:23.860> be

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
to really do things that we wouldn't be

to really do things that we wouldn't be
able<00:00:24.189> to<00:00:24.340> do<00:00:24.460> as<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.669> single<00:00:25.000> studio<00:00:25.649> so<00:00:26.649> I<00:00:26.680> think

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
able to do as a single studio so I think

collaboration on quite you know all of

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.110 
collaboration on quite you know all of
our<00:00:32.169> big<00:00:32.349> franchises<00:00:32.920> since<00:00:33.460> assassins<00:00:33.940> creed

two<00:00:34.180> that<00:00:34.540> was<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.809> first<00:00:35.050> game<00:00:35.770> where<00:00:36.040> we

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
two that was the first game where we

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.980 
two that was the first game where we
really<00:00:36.450> started<00:00:37.450> working<00:00:37.810> collaboratively

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
really started working collaboratively

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.530 
really started working collaboratively
across<00:00:38.470> studios<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.280> we<00:00:39.970> have<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> pretty<00:00:40.480> good

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
across studios and we have a pretty good

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.990 
across studios and we have a pretty good
system<00:00:40.870> for<00:00:41.110> making<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.680> work<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.220> it<00:00:42.790> really

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
system for making it work and it really

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700 
system for making it work and it really
you<00:00:43.330> know<00:00:43.450> I<00:00:43.480> think<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.020> way<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.140> we<00:00:44.380> do<00:00:44.530> it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
you know I think the way that we do it

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.740 
you know I think the way that we do it
the<00:00:45.100> key<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.490> really<00:00:45.760> giving<00:00:45.940> each<00:00:46.300> studio

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
the key is really giving each studio

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.440 
the key is really giving each studio
their<00:00:47.020> own<00:00:47.940> chunk<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:49.120> they<00:00:49.270> can

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
their own chunk that they can

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.569 
their own chunk that they can
autonomously<00:00:49.750> work<00:00:50.410> on<00:00:50.620> with<00:00:51.220> their<00:00:51.490> own

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
autonomously work on with their own

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.130 
autonomously work on with their own
creative<00:00:52.000> input<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.750> know<00:00:52.840> that's<00:00:53.020> how<00:00:53.079> you

get great things so those teams can

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.940 
get great things so those teams can

thing<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.840> think<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.140> really<00:03:13.440> cool<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
thing I think is really cool is the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.620 
thing I think is really cool is the
scope<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:14.910> seamlessly

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
scope and that it's seamlessly

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.480 
scope and that it's seamlessly
integrated<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:17.070> going<00:03:17.220> into

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
integrated so it's not like going into

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.130 
integrated so it's not like going into
your<00:03:17.730> menu<00:03:17.880> anymore<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.600> saying<00:03:18.810> okay<00:03:19.050> I'm

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
your menu anymore and saying okay I'm

so it's all kind of the world is
literally<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:51.510> oyster<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.080> it's<00:03:52.230> all

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
literally your oyster and it's all

literally your oyster and it's all
seamlessly<00:03:52.590> integrated<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.519> that's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
seamlessly integrated and that's

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.120 
seamlessly integrated and that's
something<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> single<00:03:55.530> economy<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.070> a

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
something with a single economy in a

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.340 
something with a single economy in a
single<00:03:56.430> upgrade<00:03:56.730> system<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.630> that's<00:03:58.170> really

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
single upgrade system so that's really

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.259 
single upgrade system so that's really
something<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.040> haven't<00:03:59.310> seen<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.670> games

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
something that we haven't seen in games

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.030 
something that we haven't seen in games
yet<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.720> kind<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.050> scope<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.680> really

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
yet that kind of scope like really

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.440 
yet that kind of scope like really
integrated<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:02.940> we're<00:04:03.060> going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> see<00:04:03.269> it

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
integrated I think we're going to see it

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.150 
integrated I think we're going to see it
a<00:04:03.510> lot<00:04:03.600> more<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.170> next-gen<00:04:04.560> systems<00:04:04.980> but

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
a lot more with the next-gen systems but

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.229 
a lot more with the next-gen systems but
it's<00:04:05.310> something<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.730> we're<00:04:05.850> already<00:04:06.030> doing

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
it's something that we're already doing

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.540 
it's something that we're already doing
on<00:04:06.600> blacklist<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.890> I'm<00:04:08.100> pretty<00:04:08.340> excited

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
on blacklist that I'm pretty excited

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.610 
on blacklist that I'm pretty excited
about<00:04:08.940> with<00:04:09.600> conviction<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.290> Max<00:04:10.500> and

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
about with conviction you know Max and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.640 
about with conviction you know Max and
Alex<00:04:11.010> came<00:04:11.549> on<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.000> conviction<00:04:12.480> team<00:04:13.320> and

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
Alex came on to the conviction team and

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.410 
Alex came on to the conviction team and
they<00:04:14.220> kind<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.489> had<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> get<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.880> shipped<00:04:15.239> it

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
they kind of had to get it shipped it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.080 
they kind of had to get it shipped it
was<00:04:15.570> off<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.959> different<00:04:16.109> direction<00:04:16.290> that

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
was off in a different direction that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.280 
was off in a different direction that
was<00:04:18.090> quite<00:04:18.299> different<00:04:18.720> than<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.959> original

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
was quite different than the original

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
was quite different than the original
splinter<00:04:19.590> cells<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:19.919> they<00:04:19.950> came<00:04:20.160> on<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.489> they

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
splinter cells so they came on and they

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.540 
splinter cells so they came on and they
did<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> vision<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.780> but<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.740> know<00:04:22.830> it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
did have a vision and but you know it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.040 
did have a vision and but you know it
had<00:04:23.700> already<00:04:23.850> been<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.360> development<00:04:24.539> for<00:04:24.900> a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
had already been in development for a

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.440 
had already been in development for a
couple<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.320> years<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.770> they<00:04:25.860> only<00:04:26.010> had<00:04:26.220> so

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
couple of years and they only had so

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.180 
couple of years and they only had so
much<00:04:26.570> time<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.200> kind<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.560> wrap<00:04:27.710> it<00:04:27.890> up<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.070> get

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
much time to kind of wrap it up and get

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.770 
much time to kind of wrap it up and get
it<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.490> shelves<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.180> really<00:04:29.660> with

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
it on the shelves so really with

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.230 
it on the shelves so really with
blacklist<00:04:30.320> they're<00:04:30.590> getting<00:04:30.920> to<00:04:31.210> kind<00:04:32.210> of

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
blacklist they're getting to kind of

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.580 
blacklist they're getting to kind of
follow<00:04:32.450> through<00:04:32.600> with<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.140> whole<00:04:33.290> vision

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
follow through with the whole vision

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.980 
follow through with the whole vision
which<00:04:34.130> isn't<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:34.910> expanding<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> type<00:04:35.960> of

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
which isn't just expanding the type of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.720 
which isn't just expanding the type of
gameplay<00:04:36.380> options<00:04:36.800> which<00:04:37.280> i<00:04:37.370> think<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.610> know

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
gameplay options which i think you know

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.490 
gameplay options which i think you know
they<00:04:37.940> started<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.390> do<00:04:38.510> on<00:04:38.630> conviction<00:04:39.080> but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
they started to do on conviction but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.410 
they started to do on conviction but
really<00:04:39.860> innovating<00:04:40.730> from<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.060> roots<00:04:41.240> of

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
really innovating from the roots of

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.940 
really innovating from the roots of
splinter<00:04:41.750> cell<00:04:41.930> bringing<00:04:42.290> back<00:04:42.440> all<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.770> these

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
splinter cell bringing back all of these

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.280 
splinter cell bringing back all of these
stealth<00:04:43.340> elements<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:44.090> ghost<00:04:44.690> play<00:04:44.960> style

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
stealth elements the ghost play style
