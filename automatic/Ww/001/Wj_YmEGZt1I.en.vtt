00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
case but to be perfectly honest I'm not

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
case but to be perfectly honest I'm not
happy<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.449> review<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.840> once<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
happy with that review and once this is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.410 
happy with that review and once this is
proposed<00:00:32.189> I'll<00:00:32.460> probably<00:00:32.759> actually<00:00:33.059> be

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
proposed I'll probably actually be

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
proposed I'll probably actually be
taking<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.989> down<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:35.340> because<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
taking that one down just because the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.200 
taking that one down just because the
camera<00:00:37.020> quality<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.500> bad<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.969> wanted

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
camera quality was bad and I just wanted

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
camera quality was bad and I just wanted
to<00:00:39.239> pretty<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:41.070> actually

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to pretty much we do it and I actually

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.979 
to pretty much we do it and I actually
got<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> good<00:00:41.850> deal<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> couple<00:00:42.870> weeks

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
got a good deal on this a couple weeks

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
got a good deal on this a couple weeks
ago<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> picked<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.640> started<00:00:44.700> using

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
ago so I picked it up and started using

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.590 
ago so I picked it up and started using
it<00:00:45.660> again<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> case

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it again and I do look like this case

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
it again and I do look like this case
now<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.649> its<00:00:49.770> flaws<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.610> I'll

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
now it does have its flaws which I'll

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
now it does have its flaws which I'll
touch<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> close<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> camp<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.489> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
touch on in the close of camp but you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.889 
touch on in the close of camp but you
know<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.030> jump<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.270> close-up<00:00:54.719> camera

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
know let's just jump up close-up camera

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
know let's just jump up close-up camera
and<00:00:55.170> touch<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.500> those<00:00:55.590> flaws<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> good

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and touch on those flaws and the good

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270 
and touch on those flaws and the good
parts<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.879> case<00:00:57.559> okay<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.010> many<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
parts of this case okay so as many of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
parts of this case okay so as many of
you<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.090> incase<00:01:00.629> slider<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:01.320> pretty

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you know the incase slider was pretty

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
you know the incase slider was pretty
much<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> original<00:01:02.969> cases<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
much one of the original cases for the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.700 
much one of the original cases for the
iphone<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.549> i<00:01:05.549> must<00:01:05.880> admit<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:06.810> stood<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
iphone and i must admit it was stood the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210 
iphone and i must admit it was stood the
test<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.330> exceedingly<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:10.040> in<00:01:11.040> case

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
test of time exceedingly well in case

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
test of time exceedingly well in case
has<00:01:11.430> pretty<00:01:11.700> much<00:01:11.909> made<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.540> entire<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
has pretty much made this an entire this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.140 
has pretty much made this an entire this
line<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> cases<00:01:15.420> pretty<00:01:16.380> much<00:01:16.500> its<00:01:16.680> own<00:01:16.860> little

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
line of cases pretty much its own little

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
line of cases pretty much its own little
dynasty<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:19.110> different<00:01:19.259> styles<00:01:19.860> it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
comment box but let's just get into the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.850 
comment box but let's just get into the
actual<00:01:49.920> case<00:01:50.250> itself<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.350> does<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
actual case itself what just does pretty

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.319 
actual case itself what just does pretty
much<00:01:52.920> anything<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.579> case<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> cuts<00:01:54.210> are

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
much anything with in case the cuts are

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
much anything with in case the cuts are
really<00:01:54.600> nice<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.110> camera<00:01:55.439> hole<00:01:55.649> could<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
really nice the camera hole could be a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.920 
really nice the camera hole could be a
little<00:01:56.759> smaller<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:57.420> opinion<00:01:57.750> because

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
little smaller in my opinion because

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.289 
little smaller in my opinion because
with<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:58.530> excess<00:01:58.979> space<00:01:59.299> you're

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
with all this little excess space you're

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.289 
with all this little excess space you're
going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.170> getting<00:02:01.259> lint<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.640> dust

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
going to be getting lint and just dust

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
going to be getting lint and just dust
and<00:02:03.509> crap<00:02:03.719> between<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> phone<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> case

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
too much hassle here because I'll call

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.979 
too much hassle here because I'll call
her<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:40.819> but<00:03:41.819> as<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.419> guys<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.660> tell<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
her back but as you guys can tell that

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.379 
her back but as you guys can tell that
does<00:03:43.379> take<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.579> bit<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.819> effort<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.269> get

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
does take a little bit of effort to get

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.670 
does take a little bit of effort to get
that<00:03:45.510> off<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:45.750> doesn't<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.169> slide<00:03:46.260> right<00:03:46.410> off

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
that off it doesn't just slide right off

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.890 
that off it doesn't just slide right off
which<00:03:47.639> is<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:48.480> doesn't<00:03:48.720> slide<00:03:48.840> off

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
which is good that it doesn't slide off

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.589 
which is good that it doesn't slide off
because<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.169> means<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.739> not<00:03:50.010> going<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
because that means it's not going to

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.119 
because that means it's not going to
just<00:03:51.599> fall<00:03:51.810> apart<00:03:51.900> while<00:03:52.500> you're<00:03:52.650> using<00:03:52.859> it

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.240 
off of there now just a little bit of
design<00:04:00.690> though<00:04:00.930> if<00:04:01.470> they<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.799> have<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.129> in

second slider I've had both of them
pretty<00:04:08.010> much<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> same<00:04:08.430> design<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.690> you

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
pretty much the same design so if you

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.629 
pretty much the same design so if you
get<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.079> bamboo<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.859> floor<00:04:11.190> oh<00:04:11.220> I'm<00:04:11.519> not

get the bamboo or the floor oh I'm not

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.030 
get the bamboo or the floor oh I'm not
sure<00:04:11.879> if<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.209> logo<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.870> still<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.440> or<00:04:13.590> if

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
sure if the logo is still here or if

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.219 
sure if the logo is still here or if
it's<00:04:14.160> moved<00:04:14.459> somewhere<00:04:14.760> else<00:04:15.919> but<00:04:16.919> guys<00:04:17.820> I've

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
really happy with this case the only

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.060 
really happy with this case the only
downside<00:04:21.239> i<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:21.870> which<00:04:22.140> i<00:04:22.380> had<00:04:22.890> with

the first one I tried I had
the<00:04:24.699> power<00:04:24.939> slide<00:04:25.330> or<00:04:25.509> so<00:04:25.689> it's<00:04:26.560> not<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.800> mine

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
the power slide or so it's not just mine

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.059 
the power slide or so it's not just mine
is<00:04:27.550> these<00:04:28.060> things<00:04:28.360> destroy<00:04:29.169> screen<00:04:29.680> shields

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
is these things destroy screen shields

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
is sgp i was wondering i was actually

going to go buy some SGPS while order

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.649 
going to go buy some SGPS while order
them<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.610> can<00:04:42.759> actually<00:04:42.879> buy<00:04:43.090> them<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.389> stores

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
them you can actually buy them in stores

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.309 
them you can actually buy them in stores
but<00:04:45.150> I've<00:04:46.150> tried<00:04:46.509> them<00:04:46.629> before<00:04:46.719> I<00:04:46.930> wasn't

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
but I've tried them before I wasn't

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.899 
but I've tried them before I wasn't
really<00:04:47.500> too<00:04:47.590> impressed<00:04:48.039> with<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.400> quality<00:04:48.610> of

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
really too impressed with the quality of

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.179 
really too impressed with the quality of
them<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.539> might<00:04:50.080> have<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.319> revisit<00:04:50.710> them<00:04:51.009> though

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
them I might have to revisit them though

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.839 
them I might have to revisit them though
but<00:04:52.680> that's<00:04:53.680> pretty<00:04:54.009> much<00:04:54.129> the<00:04:54.280> reason<00:04:54.580> I

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
but that's pretty much the reason I

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.850 
but that's pretty much the reason I
won't<00:04:55.270> be<00:04:55.629> using<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:55.960> case<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.229> ton<00:04:56.530> because<00:04:56.680> I

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
won't be using this case a ton because I

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.499 
won't be using this case a ton because I
like<00:04:57.190> having<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> screen<00:04:57.699> shield<00:04:57.879> on<00:04:58.120> my<00:04:58.300> phone

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
like having a screen shield on my phone

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.649 
like having a screen shield on my phone
and<00:04:59.250> with<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.520> get<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:00.940> watermarks<00:05:01.539> on

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
and with this you get the watermarks on

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.540 
and with this you get the watermarks on
the<00:05:01.780> side<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.199> get<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.469> but<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.979> air<00:05:03.129> bubbles

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
the side you get the but the air bubbles

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.209 
the side you get the but the air bubbles
and<00:05:03.819> it's<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:05.080> just<00:05:05.289> pretty<00:05:05.680> much<00:05:05.770> destroys

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
and it's it just pretty much destroys

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:07.709 
and it's it just pretty much destroys
your<00:05:06.370> screen<00:05:06.699> shields<00:05:07.090> unless<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.479> do<00:05:07.599> have

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
your screen shields unless you do have

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.379 
your screen shields unless you do have
the<00:05:07.750> sgp<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.560> even<00:05:09.099> if<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.280> have<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.639> sgp<00:05:10.210> you

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
the sgp and even if you have the sgp you

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.059 
the sgp and even if you have the sgp you
have<00:05:10.599> to<00:05:10.750> pretty<00:05:10.990> much<00:05:11.110> install<00:05:11.469> the<00:05:11.650> screen

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
have to pretty much install the screen

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.469 
have to pretty much install the screen
shield<00:05:12.250> with<00:05:12.969> the<00:05:13.509> case<00:05:13.900> on<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.409> phone<00:05:14.650> and

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
shield with the case on the phone and

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.850 
shield with the case on the phone and
the<00:05:16.479> last<00:05:16.719> real<00:05:17.050> issue<00:05:17.259> I<00:05:17.379> have<00:05:17.650> with<00:05:17.680> this

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
the last real issue I have with this

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.180 
the last real issue I have with this
case<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.840> kind<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.199> clicks<00:05:20.620> on<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.979> side

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
case is it kind of clicks on the side

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.339 
case is it kind of clicks on the side
and<00:05:21.460> let<00:05:22.029> me<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.659> if<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:22.810> can't<00:05:23.020> get<00:05:23.139> some

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
at the connecting points it kind of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.219 
at the connecting points it kind of
squeaks<00:05:30.789> it<00:05:31.000> kind<00:05:31.150> of<00:05:31.210> creaks<00:05:31.569> clicks

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
squeaks it kind of creaks clicks

but don't expect it to stay all nice
looking<00:06:07.810> because<00:06:08.229> what<00:06:09.009> I<00:06:09.039> actually<00:06:09.190> found

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
looking because what I actually found

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.040 
looking because what I actually found
out<00:06:09.699> is<00:06:09.879> this<00:06:10.000> is<00:06:10.150> actually<00:06:10.479> just<00:06:10.629> a<00:06:10.779> soft

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
out is this is actually just a soft

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.469 
out is this is actually just a soft
coating<00:06:11.620> over<00:06:12.310> the<00:06:12.400> actual<00:06:12.550> plastic<00:06:12.940> itself

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
coating over the actual plastic itself

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.119 
coating over the actual plastic itself
and<00:06:13.810> this<00:06:13.930> can<00:06:14.199> get<00:06:14.379> nicked<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:14.830> can<00:06:15.009> get

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
and this can get nicked and it can get

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.990 
and this can get nicked and it can get
peeled<00:06:15.550> so<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:17.860> you're<00:06:18.159> someone<00:06:18.460> who<00:06:18.639> is<00:06:18.699> going

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
looking this way that might be a
