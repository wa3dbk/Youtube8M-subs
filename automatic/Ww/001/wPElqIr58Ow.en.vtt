three ads in the game I think they had

another<00:04:54.180> two<00:04:54.449> in<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.050> pregame<00:04:55.259> show<00:04:55.800> right<00:04:56.069> I

another two in the pregame show right I

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.540 
another two in the pregame show right I

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
that's a lot of ads is it worse a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.300 
that's a lot of ads is it worse a
company<00:05:00.199> sort<00:05:01.199> of<00:05:01.289> saturating<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:01.979> Super

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
company sort of saturating the Super

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.189 
company sort of saturating the Super
Bowl<00:05:02.340> as<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.849> were<00:05:02.969> I<00:05:03.300> think<00:05:03.659> for<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.870> company

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
Bowl as it were I think for a company

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.869 
Bowl as it were I think for a company
like<00:05:04.289> them<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.949> their<00:05:05.069> up<00:05:05.279> and<00:05:05.370> coming<00:05:05.460> I

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
like them and their up and coming I

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.730 
like them and their up and coming I
think<00:05:05.939> that<00:05:06.330> they<00:05:06.509> get<00:05:06.930> their<00:05:07.080> name<00:05:07.110> out<00:05:07.289> there

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
think that they get their name out there

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.159 
think that they get their name out there
you<00:05:08.460> know<00:05:08.580> then<00:05:09.029> they've<00:05:09.539> been<00:05:09.569> kind<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.990> like

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
you know then they've been kind of like

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.899 
you know then they've been kind of like
hidden<00:05:10.589> for<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> long<00:05:10.949> time<00:05:11.189> and<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.490> think<00:05:11.550> now

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
hidden for a long time and I think now

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.059 
hidden for a long time and I think now
they<00:05:12.569> are<00:05:12.750> being<00:05:12.900> coming<00:05:13.169> more<00:05:13.379> confident<00:05:13.919> I

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
they are being coming more confident I

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.019 
they are being coming more confident I
think<00:05:14.250> they're<00:05:14.400> getting<00:05:14.580> their<00:05:14.699> name<00:05:14.849> up

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
think they're getting their name up

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.239 
think they're getting their name up
there<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.300> idea<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.839> Sonata<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:17.009> know<00:05:17.099> and

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:17.249 
there the idea of Sonata you know and

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:19.010 
there the idea of Sonata you know and
how<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.460> used<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.879> very<00:05:18.089> simple<00:05:18.719> way<00:05:18.990> of

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
how they used it very simple way of

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.480 
how they used it very simple way of
getting<00:05:19.409> that<00:05:19.499> name<00:05:19.979> out<00:05:20.189> there<00:05:20.370> to

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
getting that name out there to

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.070 
getting that name out there to
communicate<00:05:20.969> that<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.419> I<00:05:21.479> think<00:05:21.839> there<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:21.990> a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
communicate that and I think there is a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.439 
communicate that and I think there is a
confidence<00:05:22.589> there<00:05:22.830> so<00:05:23.270> for<00:05:24.270> them<00:05:24.419> a

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
confidence there so for them a

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.610 
confidence there so for them a
particular<00:05:24.779> it<00:05:25.050> might<00:05:25.169> not<00:05:25.289> be<00:05:25.349> right<00:05:25.560> for

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
particular it might not be right for

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.290 
particular it might not be right for
other<00:05:25.860> car<00:05:26.129> companies<00:05:26.159> at<00:05:26.699> this<00:05:26.849> point<00:05:27.120> but

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
other car companies at this point but

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.820 
other car companies at this point but
for<00:05:27.479> them<00:05:27.659> I<00:05:27.689> think<00:05:27.839> they're<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:28.710> hitting

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
for them I think they're just hitting

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.929 
for them I think they're just hitting
their<00:05:29.009> stride<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.520> think<00:05:29.729> it<00:05:29.819> was

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
their stride and I think it was

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.700 
their stride and I think it was
worthwhile<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:30.360> what's<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.199> cost<00:05:31.349> to<00:05:31.560> do<00:05:31.680> a

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
worthwhile for what's it cost to do a

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.350 
worthwhile for what's it cost to do a
