00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
himself and he's been steadily drinking

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.120 
himself and he's been steadily drinking
it<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.760> he's<00:02:43.330> quite<00:02:43.510> happy<00:02:43.720> with<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.110> yeah<00:02:45.069> of

it and he's quite happy with it yeah of

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.610 
it and he's quite happy with it yeah of
course

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.020 

because<00:02:48.660> eczema<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.930> something<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:51.030> can

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
because eczema is not something that can

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.089 
because eczema is not something that can
be<00:02:52.090> cured<00:02:52.390> all<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> doctor<00:02:53.590> says<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:54.010> you

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
be cured all the doctor says that you

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.170 
be cured all the doctor says that you
can<00:02:54.220> only<00:02:54.250> control<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.730> prepared<00:02:58.090> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
can only control it so we prepared that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.009 
can only control it so we prepared that
it's<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> lifetime<00:02:59.110> thing<00:02:59.739> yeah

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
it's going to be a lifetime thing yeah

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.840 
it's going to be a lifetime thing yeah
this<00:03:02.019> what<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> sauce<00:03:02.470> list<00:03:03.370> at<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.580> point

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
this what the sauce list at this point

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.309 
this what the sauce list at this point
of<00:03:04.000> time<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.360> see<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.959> notice<00:03:05.230> that

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
of time you see that you notice that

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.580 
of time you see that you notice that
there's<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.560> huge<00:03:06.370> improvement<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.989> path<00:03:08.200> she

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
there's a huge improvement the path she

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.380 
there's a huge improvement the path she
has<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.920> go<00:03:09.069> through<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.519> lot<00:03:09.849> of<00:03:09.940> moisturizing

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
has to go through a lot of moisturizing

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.380 
has to go through a lot of moisturizing
so<00:03:11.049> if<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.380> had<00:03:11.709> lots<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.640> moisturizer<00:03:13.150> at

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
so if you had lots of moisturizer at

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.130 
so if you had lots of moisturizer at
home<00:03:13.980> sure<00:03:14.980> has<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> control<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
home sure has a control to that so I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.350 
home sure has a control to that so I
think<00:03:17.230> even<00:03:17.890> over<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.430> long<00:03:18.640> term<00:03:18.970> what

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
think even over the long term what

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.780 
think even over the long term what
immediate<00:03:19.780> benefit<00:03:20.170> will<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.640> use<00:03:21.640> less

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
immediate benefit will be I use less

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.930 
immediate benefit will be I use less
moisturizer<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:23.170> know<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.239> has<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.269> much

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.050 

see<00:03:30.420> because

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
see because

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.910 

I<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.630> need<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.840> channel<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.260> fall<00:03:34.500> sick<00:03:34.740> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
I just need one channel to fall sick and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.610 
I just need one channel to fall sick and
we<00:03:35.069> were<00:03:35.100> infected<00:03:36.260> because<00:03:37.260> children

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
we were infected because children

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.559 
we were infected because children
humidity<00:03:38.160> level<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:39.260> one<00:03:40.260> very<00:03:41.360> redevelop<00:03:42.360> it

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
humidity level is one very redevelop it

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.470 
humidity level is one very redevelop it
is<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.170> ch3<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.610> they<00:03:44.670> tend<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> fall<00:03:45.270> sick

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480

babies<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.500> children<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:47.130> quite<00:03:47.310> effective

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.240 

they<00:03:52.500> couldn't<00:03:52.800> tell<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.220> difference

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
they couldn't tell the difference

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.530 
they couldn't tell the difference
actually<00:03:53.850> please<00:03:56.090> tell<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.210> difference

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
actually please tell the difference

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.200 
actually please tell the difference
between<00:03:58.320> t1<00:03:59.280> city<00:03:59.580> have<00:03:59.700> been<00:03:59.730> drinking<00:04:00.150> on

between t1 city have been drinking on

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.630 
between t1 city have been drinking on
the<00:04:00.360> wild<00:04:00.630> with<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.530> what's<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.830> sauce<00:04:02.040> also

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the wild with so what's the sauce also

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.460 
the wild with so what's the sauce also
the<00:04:02.820> people<00:04:02.970> who<00:04:03.090> are<00:04:03.330> considering<00:04:03.930> checking

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
the people who are considering checking

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
the people who are considering checking
out<00:04:04.590> or<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> sauce<00:04:05.870> they<00:04:06.870> should<00:04:07.080> definitely

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
out or the sauce they should definitely

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.640 
out or the sauce they should definitely
definitely<00:04:08.490> take<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> closer<00:04:09.150> look<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:10.020> believe

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
definitely take a closer look I believe

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.350 
definitely take a closer look I believe
their<00:04:10.860> website<00:04:11.220> has<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.580> lot<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.850> information

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
their website has a lot of information

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.090 
their website has a lot of information
and<00:04:12.450> more<00:04:12.810> importantly<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.350> think<00:04:13.500> they<00:04:13.920> should

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
and more importantly I think they should

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.930 
and more importantly I think they should
go<00:04:14.220> down<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.580> showroom<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:16.790> look<00:04:17.790> at<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
go down to the showroom and look at the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.000 
go down to the showroom and look at the
demonstration<00:04:18.540> which<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.840> quite<00:04:19.080> remarkable

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
demonstration which is quite remarkable

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.100 
demonstration which is quite remarkable
if<00:04:20.610> they<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:21.000> for<00:04:21.180> themselves<00:04:21.330> the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
if they see for themselves the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.100 
if they see for themselves the
demonstration<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.750> alkalinity<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
demonstration of the alkalinity and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.460 
demonstration of the alkalinity and
acidity<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.680> water<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:28.230> water

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
acidity of the water and this water

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.540 
acidity of the water and this water
looks<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.010> same

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
looks the same

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.450 
looks the same
it<00:04:30.090> looks<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.480> same<00:04:30.830> but<00:04:31.830> when<00:04:32.130> they<00:04:32.220> do<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
it looks the same but when they do the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.980 
it looks the same but when they do the
test<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.850> actually<00:04:33.090> see<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.360> difference<00:04:33.750> and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
test you actually see the difference and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.430 
test you actually see the difference and
so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.770> think<00:04:35.160> they<00:04:35.550> should<00:04:35.730> definitely<00:04:36.440> for

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
so I think they should definitely for

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.290 
so I think they should definitely for
their<00:04:37.560> health<00:04:37.770> think<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.670> those<00:04:38.850> out<00:04:39.270> there

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
their health think to those out there

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.160 
their health think to those out there
who<00:04:39.840> are<00:04:39.990> still<00:04:40.170> considering<00:04:41.630> whether<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.780> buy

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
who are still considering whether to buy

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.620 
who are still considering whether to buy
to<00:04:43.650> purchase<00:04:43.980> money<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.030> also<00:04:45.180> nice<00:04:45.420> or

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
to purchase money what is also nice or

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.290 
to purchase money what is also nice or
not<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:47.310> think<00:04:47.580> about<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:49.020> benefits<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.980> has

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
not just think about the benefits it has

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.010 
not just think about the benefits it has
more<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.140> he'll<00:04:52.380> sit<00:04:53.280> up<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:54.020> it's

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
more for you he'll sit up this it's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.190 
more for you he'll sit up this it's
still<00:04:55.350> cheaper<00:04:56.220> than<00:04:56.250> fine<00:04:57.150> distilled<00:04:57.990> water

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
still cheaper than fine distilled water

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.160 
still cheaper than fine distilled water
and<00:04:59.190> also<00:04:59.340> time<00:04:59.730> we<00:04:59.850> don't<00:05:00.030> see<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.960> price

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
and also time we don't see the price

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.570 
and also time we don't see the price
difference<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.680> we<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.920> bite<00:05:02.160> there's<00:05:02.430> still

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
difference if we just bite there's still
