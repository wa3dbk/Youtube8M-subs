this to really really really simple way

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.740 
this to really really really simple way
for<00:00:10.320> laying<00:00:11.309> out<00:00:11.519> your<00:00:11.550> barracks<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
for laying out your barracks so the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.360 
for laying out your barracks so the
problem<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.139> find<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> new<00:00:13.740> barracks<00:00:14.130> is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
problem i find with the new barracks is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.829 
problem i find with the new barracks is
when<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.759> open<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.269> they<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> course

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
when you open them up they of course

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
when you open them up they of course
have<00:00:16.080> these<00:00:16.379> relatively<00:00:16.920> new<00:00:17.190> arrows<00:00:17.580> go<00:00:17.880> left

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
have these relatively new arrows go left

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
have these relatively new arrows go left
and<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.480> between<00:00:18.660> them<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.619> i<00:00:19.890> find<00:00:20.250> that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and right between them but i find that

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980 
and right between them but i find that
sort<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> confusing<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.570> barracks<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sort of confusing to which barracks that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
sort of confusing to which barracks that
switches<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.800> here's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.400> easy<00:00:23.640> way

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
switches to so here's a really easy way

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
switches to so here's a really easy way
just<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.630> order<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.529> map<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
just to order them on the map so it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
just to order them on the map so it
always<00:00:26.340> makes<00:00:26.670> sense<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:27.660> so

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
always makes sense which one is which so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.410 
always makes sense which one is which so
i'm<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.609> open<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.000> random

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
i'm going to go to just open up a random

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
i'm going to go to just open up a random
one<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.920> train<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.279> first<00:00:32.550> unit<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.120> i'm

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
one and train the first unit then i'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.220 
one and train the first unit then i'm
going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> train<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> second<00:00:33.930> unit<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
going to train the second unit in the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to train the second unit in the
second<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.280> third<00:00:35.309> unit<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
second one and the third unit in this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.180 
second one and the third unit in this
third<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.260> second<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> second

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
third one so here we go second a second

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
third one so here we go second a second
third<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> third<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> fourth<00:00:40.020> okay

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
third and the third and fourth okay

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.900 
third and the third and fourth okay
perfect<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.920> worked<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:41.820> going

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
perfect that worked out now we're going

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.250 
perfect that worked out now we're going
to<00:00:41.969> zoom<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> look<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
to zoom out and we're going to look at

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
to zoom out and we're going to look at
which<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> where<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.430> here's<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
which is one is where so here's the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.720 
which is one is where so here's the
first<00:00:45.079> here's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:46.680> here's<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> third

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
first here's a second here's the third

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
first here's a second here's the third
and<00:00:48.000> here's<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> fourth<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and here's the fourth so I'm going to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
and here's the fourth so I'm going to
put<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.680> order<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:51.230> 12<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:53.460> need<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
put them in order over here 12 I need to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
put them in order over here 12 I need to
get<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> torch<00:00:54.750> three<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.390> four<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
get that off the torch three and four so

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
get that off the torch three and four so
now<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.460> ahead

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
now that that's there now I can go ahead

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
now that that's there now I can go ahead
and<00:00:59.640> cancel<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.270> those<00:01:00.480> units<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> case

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and cancel out all those units in case

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
and cancel out all those units in case
you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.800> faster<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> don't

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you can go a little faster if you don't

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.280 
you can go a little faster if you don't
want<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.480> complete<00:01:03.809> or<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.140> fill<00:01:04.260> out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
want them to complete or just fill out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
want them to complete or just fill out
your<00:01:04.409> army<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.000> cancel<00:01:06.360> them

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
your army first so I just cancel them

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
your army first so I just cancel them
out<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.260> they're<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.619> order<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
out and now they're in order so if I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000 
out and now they're in order so if I
select<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.270> one's<00:01:09.600> number<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.080> two<00:01:10.500> three

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
select this one's number one two three

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.440 
select this one's number one two three
and<00:01:11.159> four<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.390> way

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and four or you can think of it this way

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
and four or you can think of it this way
this<00:01:12.720> ones<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.020> blowing<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> leftmost<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
this ones are blowing on the leftmost if

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920 
this ones are blowing on the leftmost if
I<00:01:14.310> hit<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.700> arrow<00:01:14.760> goes<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I hit the right arrow goes this right

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
I hit the right arrow goes this right
arrow<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.380> goes<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.250> arrow

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
arrow again goes to this and right arrow

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
arrow again goes to this and right arrow
again<00:01:17.670> goes<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:18.990> simply<00:01:19.259> I'm

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
again goes to this so very simply I'm

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
again goes to this so very simply I'm
going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> lay<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.280> left<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> right

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
going to lay this out from left to right

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
going to lay this out from left to right
and<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.780> logical<00:01:22.409> because

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and this is very logical because

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
and this is very logical because
whenever<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.130> come<00:01:23.280> into<00:01:23.310> any<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
whenever you come into any of them in
