00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
thread and bring it over top of that

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.390 
thread and bring it over top of that
little<00:00:07.830> round<00:00:08.540> thing<00:00:09.540> right<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:10.280> and<00:00:11.280> then

little round thing right here and then
hold<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> thread<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.540> hands<00:00:14.240> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
hold the thread with two hands the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.210 
hold the thread with two hands the
thread<00:00:15.949> goes<00:00:16.949> underneath<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.949> round

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
thread goes underneath the little round

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.359 
thread goes underneath the little round
silver<00:00:20.760> part<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:22.140> should<00:00:22.439> click<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.070> right

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
silver part and it should click in right

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.519 
silver part and it should click in right
here<00:00:23.820> towards<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:25.310> can<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.609> that

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
here towards the back can you see that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
here towards the back can you see that
okay<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.820> comes<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.420> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
okay so and then it comes out just in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.959 
okay so and then it comes out just in
this<00:00:31.109> little<00:00:31.489> notch<00:00:32.489> here<00:00:32.600> and<00:00:34.370> then<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.640> pull

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this little notch here and then you pull

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
this little notch here and then you pull
the<00:00:36.090> thread<00:00:36.239> down<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.739> goes<00:00:37.950> through<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the thread down and it goes through this

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
the thread down and it goes through this
little<00:00:38.730> loop<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.629> clicks<00:00:39.930> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
little loop and it just clicks in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
little loop and it just clicks in
through<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> loop<00:00:41.420> then<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> bring<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
through the loop then you bring the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
through the loop then you bring the
thread<00:00:43.140> straight<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:46.039> there's<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
thread straight down and there's a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.729 
thread straight down and there's a
little<00:00:47.430> lip<00:00:47.700> right<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:52.110> goes<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
little lip right here and it goes in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.819 
little lip right here and it goes in
front<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.360> lip<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.820> around<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
front of this little lip and around the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
front of this little lip and around the
tensioner<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.350> through<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.239> there

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
tensioner and through the thing there

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.850 
tensioner and through the thing there
and<00:01:04.519> then<00:01:05.519> there's<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.860> thing

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and then there's this little thing

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
and then there's this little thing
sticking<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.210> hole<00:01:09.570> in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
sticking up here with a little hole in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
sticking up here with a little hole in
it<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> thread

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it and then you got to get the thread

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.460 
it and then you got to get the thread
through<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> hole<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.479> push<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.200> from

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
through the hole so you push it in from

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.719 
through the hole so you push it in from
right<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.369> left<00:01:18.770> through<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> hole<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.460> pull

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
right to left through the hole and pull

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.960 
right to left through the hole and pull
it<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.549> I'm<00:01:23.549> holding

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it out the other side and I'm holding

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
it out the other side and I'm holding
this<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> rest<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> thread<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.530> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this the rest of the thread over here so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
this the rest of the thread over here so
it<00:01:25.890> doesn't<00:01:26.220> actually<00:01:26.420> accidentally<00:01:27.420> get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it doesn't actually accidentally get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.859 
it doesn't actually accidentally get
caught<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.869> anything<00:01:28.229> else<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
caught on anything else so now you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.580 
caught on anything else so now you
should<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> thread<00:01:32.009> spool<00:01:33.590> through

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
should have the thread spool through

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
should have the thread spool through
this<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.159> silver<00:01:35.430> guy<00:01:36.049> around<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this little silver guy around the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.380 
this little silver guy around the
tensioner<00:01:38.210> through<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.619> silver

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
tensioner through this little silver

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.260 
tensioner through this little silver
holder<00:01:42.390> through<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> eye<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:44.970> goes

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
holder through the eye and then it goes

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.899 
holder through the eye and then it goes
back<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> silver<00:01:46.500> holder<00:01:48.049> and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
back down through the silver holder and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.130 
back down through the silver holder and
then<00:01:50.909> through<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.600> clip<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.079> here

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
then through a little clip right here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
then through a little clip right here
towards<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> bottom<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> white<00:01:54.000> part<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
towards the bottom of the white part of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
towards the bottom of the white part of
the<00:01:54.450> machine<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.740> tool<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.670> should<00:01:56.880> go

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the machine just tool and it should go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.109 
the machine just tool and it should go
in<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.649> then<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> last<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.340> piece<00:01:59.700> before

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
in and then the last little piece before

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
in and then the last little piece before
the<00:02:00.509> needle<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.200> there's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.549> loop

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the needle is there's a little loop

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
the needle is there's a little loop
right<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.329> loop<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.140> I'm

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
right here you see a little loop and I'm

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.190 
right here you see a little loop and I'm
having<00:02:08.369> two<00:02:08.879> parts<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> string<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.050> my

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
having two parts of the string and my

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.589 
having two parts of the string and my
fingers<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.979> it's

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
fingers so it's

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.979 
fingers so it's
some<00:02:11.780> tension<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.379> it<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.689> clips

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
some tension on it and it just clips

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:23.110 
some tension on it and it just clips
right<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.829> through<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.489> loop<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.730> bring<00:02:22.999> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
right in through that loop just bring it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.539 
right in through that loop just bring it
down<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.560> should<00:02:24.590> come<00:02:25.129> in<00:02:25.159> because

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
down and it should come in because

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.220 
down and it should come in because
there's<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.969> little<00:02:26.209> space<00:02:26.569> in<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.870> back<00:02:27.049> of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
there's a little space in the back of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.490 
there's a little space in the back of
the<00:02:27.290> loop<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:29.629> just<00:02:29.810> pull<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.260> thread

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the loop you just pull the thread

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.020 
the loop you just pull the thread
through<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.010> then<00:02:31.189> you<00:02:31.310> thread<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:31.730> needle

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
through and then you thread the needle

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.690 
through and then you thread the needle
from<00:02:32.209> back<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.450> four<00:02:32.750> from<00:02:33.049> front<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.409> back

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
from back to four from front to back

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.170
