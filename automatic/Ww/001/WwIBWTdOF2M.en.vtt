00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
this smell is very similar to them and

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.310 
this smell is very similar to them and
it's<00:03:38.250> okay<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.610> mean<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.510> blush<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.290> know

it's okay I mean for the blush you know
I'm<00:03:40.680> all<00:03:40.860> about<00:03:40.890> how<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.489> blush<00:03:41.790> looks<00:03:42.090> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
I'm all about how the blush looks I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.670 
I'm all about how the blush looks I
don't<00:03:42.239> really<00:03:42.540> care<00:03:42.750> how<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:42.959> smells<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
don't really care how it smells but if I

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.259 
don't really care how it smells but if I
had<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.860> preference<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.489> would<00:03:44.940> definitely

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
had a preference I would definitely

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.840 
had a preference I would definitely
choose<00:03:45.450> unscented<00:03:46.170> blush<00:03:46.709> smells<00:03:47.220> because<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
choose unscented blush smells because it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.550 
choose unscented blush smells because it
just<00:03:47.970> mixes<00:03:48.390> with<00:03:48.660> everything<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.290> smell

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
just mixes with everything and I smell

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.259 
just mixes with everything and I smell
it<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.800> time<00:03:50.070> it's<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.640> my<00:03:50.760> cheeks<00:03:51.030> right

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
it all the time it's on my cheeks right

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.979 
it all the time it's on my cheeks right
so<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.320> despite<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> smell<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.780> an

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
it's a peachy blush and I wouldn't say I

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.780 
it's a peachy blush and I wouldn't say I
mean<00:04:10.230> there's<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.530> tinge<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.010> pink<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.519> but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
mean there's a tinge of pink in it but

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.880 
mean there's a tinge of pink in it but
on<00:04:12.030> when<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.810> apply<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.140> on<00:04:13.290> your<00:04:13.350> cheeks<00:04:13.709> but

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.469 
mostly it's a very peachy blush and the
best<00:04:17.010> thing<00:04:17.250> about<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.450> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479

super<00:04:19.109> pig

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
super pig

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.949 
super pig
I<00:04:20.220> would<00:04:20.459> say<00:04:20.609> more<00:04:20.849> pigmented<00:04:21.449> than<00:04:21.509> the<00:04:21.720> NARS

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.529 
I would say more pigmented than the NARS
blushes<00:04:22.439> the<00:04:23.280> first<00:04:23.490> time<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.789> use<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.150> with

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
blushes the first time I use this with

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
this small brush and I applied I was

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.790 
this small brush and I applied I was
like<00:04:26.460> whoa<00:04:26.610> hold<00:04:27.509> on<00:04:27.659> I<00:04:27.960> have<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.409> rub<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.620> away
