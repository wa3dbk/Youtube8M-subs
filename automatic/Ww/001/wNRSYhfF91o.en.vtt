of<00:01:05.780> squad-based<00:01:06.590> turn-based<00:01:07.220> strategy<00:01:07.490> so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
of squad-based turn-based strategy so

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.649 
of squad-based turn-based strategy so
I've<00:01:09.350> played<00:01:09.710> just<00:01:09.890> about<00:01:10.040> every<00:01:10.520> turn<00:01:11.390> based

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
I've played just about every turn based

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.600 
I've played just about every turn based
strategy<00:01:11.720> game<00:01:12.140> out<00:01:12.500> there<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.580> all

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
strategy game out there I think we all

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.820 
strategy game out there I think we all
had<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.270> lot<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.570> ideas<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.350> things<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.740> we

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
had a lot of ideas and things that we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.260 
had a lot of ideas and things that we
wanted<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.159> do<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.490> things<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:16.910> liked<00:01:17.120> about

wanted to do and things we liked about
all<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.870> games<00:01:18.050> that<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.320> played<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
all of the games that we played in the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.430 
all of the games that we played in the
past<00:01:19.010> I'm<00:01:19.640> just<00:01:20.060> really<00:01:20.330> finding<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.200> fun

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
past I'm just really finding the fun

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.140 
past I'm just really finding the fun
things<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.040> eliminating<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.730> things<00:01:22.940> that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
things and eliminating the things that

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.460 
things and eliminating the things that
you<00:01:23.360> know<00:01:23.480> we<00:01:23.660> didn't<00:01:23.870> really<00:01:23.900> care<00:01:24.230> so<00:01:24.410> much

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
you know we didn't really care so much

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.050 
you know we didn't really care so much
for<00:01:24.620> so<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.250> start<00:01:25.490> with<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.640> original<00:01:25.790> game

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
for so we start with the original game

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.150 
for so we start with the original game
and<00:01:26.510> we<00:01:26.570> play<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.050> we<00:01:27.140> say<00:01:27.320> okay<00:01:27.500> well<00:01:27.920> we

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
diehards like we find this concert we

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.940 
diehards like we find this concert we
can<00:01:32.480> improve<00:01:32.690> this<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> little<00:01:33.170> bit<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:33.860> of

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
can improve this a little bit and one of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.620 
can improve this a little bit and one of
the<00:01:34.010> first<00:01:34.250> things<00:01:34.370> we<00:01:34.670> looked<00:01:34.880> at<00:01:35.030> was<00:01:35.240> time

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
the first things we looked at was time

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.940 
the first things we looked at was time
units<00:01:36.020> when<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.230> idea<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:36.680> your

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
units when the idea is that your

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.740 
units when the idea is that your
soldiers<00:01:37.430> had<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.820> certain<00:01:38.210> number<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.480> time

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
soldiers had a certain number of time

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.570 
soldiers had a certain number of time
units<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.350> move<00:01:39.530> around<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.830> battlefield<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
units to move around the battlefield to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.430 
units to move around the battlefield to
perform<00:01:41.060> abilities<00:01:41.510> take<00:01:41.780> shots<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.290> things

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
perform abilities take shots and things

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.470 
perform abilities take shots and things
like<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.950> actually<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.000> worked<00:01:44.240> great

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
like that and actually it worked great

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.750 
like that and actually it worked great
in<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.870> sense<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:45.410> had<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:46.100> resource

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
in the sense that you had this resource

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.580 
in the sense that you had this resource
that<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.270> were<00:01:47.420> hoarding<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.230> that<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.500> had

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
that you were hoarding and that you had

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.140 
that you were hoarding and that you had
to<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.770> careful<00:01:48.800> because<00:01:49.400> when<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.730> spent<00:01:50.000> too

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
to be careful because when you spent too

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.840 
to be careful because when you spent too
many<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.510> could<00:01:50.690> find<00:01:50.900> yourself<00:01:51.580> exposed<00:01:52.580> and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
many you could find yourself exposed and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.190 
many you could find yourself exposed and
in<00:01:52.970> dangerous<00:01:53.330> situations<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.960> there<00:01:54.110> was

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
in dangerous situations so there was

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.899 
in dangerous situations so there was
this<00:01:54.260> great<00:01:54.440> risk<00:01:54.770> reward<00:01:54.950> mechanic

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.940 

you<00:02:02.909> said<00:02:03.119> okay<00:02:03.360> how<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:04.079> simplify<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you said okay how can we simplify that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
you said okay how can we simplify that
and<00:02:05.250> sort<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.700> free<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.180> all<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.689> headspace

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and sort of free up all that headspace

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
and sort of free up all that headspace
that<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.680> takes<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> players<00:02:08.610> head

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that that takes up in the players head

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.320 
that that takes up in the players head
we<00:02:09.509> sort<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> turned<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.920> time<00:02:11.580> units<00:02:11.940> into<00:02:12.300> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
we sort of turned the time units into a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.270 
we sort of turned the time units into a
simplified<00:02:13.080> version<00:02:13.110> where<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> player<00:02:14.010> has

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
simplified version where the player has

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.190 
simplified version where the player has
a<00:02:14.310> number<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.880> moves<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.050> perform

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
a number of moves that they can perform

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.620 
a number of moves that they can perform
per<00:02:16.800> turn<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.459> they<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.090> choose<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.450> move

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
per turn and they can choose to move

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.210 
per turn and they can choose to move
they<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.110> choose<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.440> move<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.769> shoot<00:02:19.980> they

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
they can choose to move and shoot they

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.339 
they can choose to move and shoot they
can<00:02:20.340> choose<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.610> move<00:02:20.760> really<00:02:21.090> far<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.200> then

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
can choose to move really far and then

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.050 
can choose to move really far and then
based<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.890> different<00:02:23.280> abilities<00:02:23.760> their

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
based on different abilities their

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.580 
based on different abilities their
soldiers<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.630> maybe<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.319> use<00:02:25.470> those

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
soldiers have maybe they can use those

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
soldiers have maybe they can use those
abilities<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.160> do<00:02:26.280> different<00:02:26.580> things<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
abilities to do different things but it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.699 
abilities to do different things but it
still<00:02:27.480> has<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.690> great<00:02:28.110> risk<00:02:28.530> reward

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
still has that great risk reward

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.589 
still has that great risk reward
mechanic<00:02:29.340> look<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.610> need<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.880> run<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.360> far

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
mechanic look I need to run really far

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.720 
mechanic look I need to run really far
this<00:02:30.780> time<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.519> you're

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this time but when you do that you're

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
this time but when you do that you're
always<00:02:32.880> taking<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.330> cost<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.900> you're<00:02:34.230> not

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
always taking the cost that you're not

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.330 
always taking the cost that you're not
going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.590> able<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.830> shoot<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.280> then

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
going to be able to shoot and then

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
going to be able to shoot and then
you're<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> find<00:02:35.850> yourself<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.269> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you're going to find yourself in the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.090 
you're going to find yourself in the
difficult<00:02:36.810> tactical<00:02:37.319> position<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.920> other

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
difficult tactical position the other

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
difficult tactical position the other
big<00:02:44.670> thing<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.030> think<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.569> did<00:02:45.780> was<00:02:45.959> was<00:02:46.350> we

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
big thing I think that we did was was we

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.559 
big thing I think that we did was was we
added<00:02:46.620> cover<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> game<00:02:47.459> now<00:02:47.880> tactically

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
added cover to the game now tactically

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.030 
added cover to the game now tactically
you<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.840> lot<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.140> important<00:02:49.590> decisions

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you have a lot more important decisions

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.949 
you have a lot more important decisions
to<00:02:50.160> make<00:02:50.310> based<00:02:50.610> off<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.880> being<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.480> low<00:02:51.660> cover

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
to make based off of being in low cover

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.190 
to make based off of being in low cover
and<00:02:52.230> high<00:02:52.380> cover<00:02:52.880> flanking<00:02:53.880> aliens<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.900> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and high cover flanking aliens so in

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.900 
and high cover flanking aliens so in
some<00:02:55.709> ways<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.010> feel<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.459> made<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> game

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
some ways we feel like we made the game

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.479 
some ways we feel like we made the game
more<00:02:57.530> tactical<00:02:58.530> won<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> advantage<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.340> think

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
more tactical won the advantage I think

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.729 
more tactical won the advantage I think
we<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.610> is<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> turn-based<00:03:00.269> game<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.620> we

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
we have is a turn-based game is that we

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.870 
we have is a turn-based game is that we
can<00:03:01.860> move<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.099> camera<00:03:02.280> around<00:03:02.400> wherever<00:03:02.670> we

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
can move the camera around wherever we

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.600 
can move the camera around wherever we
want<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.959> you're<00:03:04.110> making<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> game<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.280> has

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
want if you're making a game that has

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.789 
want if you're making a game that has
real-time<00:03:05.970> response<00:03:06.420> players<00:03:07.410> get<00:03:07.620> really

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
real-time response players get really

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.810 
real-time response players get really
upset<00:03:07.890> when<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> take<00:03:08.430> control<00:03:08.549> away<00:03:08.700> from

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
upset when you take control away from

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.520 
upset when you take control away from
them<00:03:09.060> well<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.780> do<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.019> every<00:03:10.140> other<00:03:10.290> turn

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
them well we do that every other turn

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
them well we do that every other turn
there's<00:03:11.100> been<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> very<00:03:11.489> cinematic<00:03:11.880> approach

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
there's been a very cinematic approach

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.420 
there's been a very cinematic approach
the<00:03:12.480> game<00:03:12.630> we're<00:03:12.810> making<00:03:13.109> now<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:14.190> wasn't

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the game we're making now that wasn't

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.610 
the game we're making now that wasn't
available<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.260> simply<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.410> we<00:03:16.440> can

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
available then simply because we can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.720 
available then simply because we can
move<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.829> camera<00:03:17.010> around<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.280> take<00:03:17.430> advantage

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
move the camera around to take advantage

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.520 
move the camera around to take advantage
of<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> 3d<00:03:18.660> game<00:03:18.690> we're<00:03:19.320> still

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
of back we have a 3d game we're still

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.039 
of back we have a 3d game we're still
leveraging<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.609> 3d<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.690> tech<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.989> we

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
leveraging the 3d and the tech that we

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.370 
leveraging the 3d and the tech that we
have<00:03:22.170> available<00:03:22.290> now<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.820> make<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.380> much

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
have available now to to make it a much

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.420 
have available now to to make it a much
more<00:03:25.530> compelling<00:03:25.799> experience<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.400> think

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
more compelling experience I think

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.090 
more compelling experience I think
visually<00:03:27.390> than<00:03:28.049> they<00:03:28.290> were<00:03:28.350> able<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.709> back

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
visually than they were able to do back

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.699 
visually than they were able to do back
then<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.640> glam<00:03:29.880> cam<00:03:30.060> was<00:03:30.269> our<00:03:30.420> way<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.870> kind<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
then the glam cam was our way of kind of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.699 
then the glam cam was our way of kind of
making<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.459> turn-based<00:03:33.150> strategy<00:03:33.450> game<00:03:33.840> sexy

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
making a turn-based strategy game sexy

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009 
making a turn-based strategy game sexy
it<00:03:34.859> was<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> way<00:03:35.160> for<00:03:35.190> us<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> take<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.569> camera

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
it was a way for us to take the camera

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.530 
it was a way for us to take the camera
and<00:03:37.230> put<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.280> put<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.579> in<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.970> environment<00:03:39.420> in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
and put it put it in the environment in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.110 
and put it put it in the environment in
a<00:03:40.049> way<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:41.069> of<00:03:41.130> got<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.609> out<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
a way that kind of got you out of the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.580 
a way that kind of got you out of the
normal<00:03:42.390> gameplay<00:03:42.600> mode<00:03:43.019> but<00:03:43.230> let<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.440> see

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
normal gameplay mode but let you see

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.539 
normal gameplay mode but let you see
things<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.859> little<00:03:43.950> clearer<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> little

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
things a little clearer and a little

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.039 
things a little clearer and a little
more<00:03:44.639> up<00:03:44.730> close<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.269> feel<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:45.840> you're<00:03:45.989> a

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
more up close and feel like you're a

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.020 
more up close and feel like you're a
little<00:03:46.079> more<00:03:46.319> part<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.650> action<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.700> idea

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
little more part of the action the idea

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.090 
little more part of the action the idea
is<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.209> when<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:49.019> soldier<00:03:49.410> goes<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.859> take<00:03:50.069> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
is that when your soldier goes to take a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.819 
is that when your soldier goes to take a
cool<00:03:50.430> shot<00:03:50.760> then<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> camera<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.319> drop<00:03:52.620> in

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
cool shot then the camera can drop in

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.559 
cool shot then the camera can drop in
we've<00:03:53.010> got<00:03:53.130> these<00:03:53.250> great<00:03:53.549> dramatic<00:03:53.819> scenes

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
we've got these great dramatic scenes

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.569 
we've got these great dramatic scenes
where<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.200> know<00:03:55.290> your<00:03:55.470> snipers<00:03:55.920> line<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:56.430> this

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
where you know your snipers line up this

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.520 
where you know your snipers line up this
super<00:03:57.239> long<00:03:57.420> shot<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.900> you'll<00:03:58.019> see<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.319> fall

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
super long shot and you'll see it fall

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
super long shot and you'll see it fall
it<00:03:58.709> right<00:03:58.920> down<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.280> barrel<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.730> what<00:04:00.329> that

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it right down the barrel and what that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.080 
it right down the barrel and what that
does<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.440> allows<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:02.340> little<00:04:02.760> more<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.000> an

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
does is it allows a little more of an

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.789 
does is it allows a little more of an
intimate<00:04:03.359> connection<00:04:03.660> between<00:04:04.139> you<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> your

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
intimate connection between you and your

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.680 
intimate connection between you and your
soldiers<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:05.790> course<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.209> increases<00:04:06.600> the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
soldiers and of course it increases the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.140 
soldiers and of course it increases the
drama<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> actual<00:04:07.889> comment<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.910> glam

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
drama of the actual comment and the glam

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.240 
drama of the actual comment and the glam
cam<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:10.139> great<00:04:10.470> way<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.680> do<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.040> that's

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
cam is is a great way to do that that's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.650 
cam is is a great way to do that that's
just<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.790> ways<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.150> we<00:04:12.209> sort<00:04:12.449> of<00:04:12.479> get

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
just one of the ways that we sort of get

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.360 
just one of the ways that we sort of get
the<00:04:12.720> camera<00:04:13.139> down<00:04:13.350> there<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.889> player<00:04:14.160> can

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the camera down there so the player can

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.440 
the camera down there so the player can
sort<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.669> see

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
sort of see

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.780 
sort of see
combat<00:04:16.260> from<00:04:16.470> their<00:04:16.590> soldiers<00:04:16.980> perspective

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.159 

the<00:04:20.790> base<00:04:21.000> was<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.209> really<00:04:21.450> unique<00:04:21.570> challenge

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
the base was a really unique challenge

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.800 
the base was a really unique challenge
for<00:04:22.410> us<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.650> design<00:04:23.060> when<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:24.180> started<00:04:24.510> on<00:04:24.660> it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
for us to design when we started on it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
for us to design when we started on it
it<00:04:24.960> was<00:04:25.050> flattened<00:04:25.530> more<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> level<00:04:26.070> in

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
it was flattened more like a level in

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.520 
it was flattened more like a level in
the<00:04:26.430> game<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.810> really<00:04:28.020> want<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.230> have<00:04:28.320> base

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
the game and we really want to have base

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.900 
the game and we really want to have base
building<00:04:28.830> but<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:29.280> ran<00:04:29.490> into<00:04:29.580> some<00:04:29.669> really

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
building but we ran into some really

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.210 
building but we ran into some really
difficult<00:04:30.600> challenges<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.680> being<00:04:31.860> flat

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
difficult challenges on it being flat

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.370 
difficult challenges on it being flat
and<00:04:32.550> working<00:04:33.510> more<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.840> level<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.350> a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
and working more like a level and a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.980 
and working more like a level and a
certain<00:04:35.370> point<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.850> couple<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.479> my<00:04:36.570> guys<00:04:36.720> had

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
certain point a couple of my guys had

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.300 
certain point a couple of my guys had
come<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.290> they<00:04:37.470> said<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.860> know<00:04:37.979> what<00:04:38.160> we

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
come in and they said you know what we

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.500 
come in and they said you know what we
keep<00:04:38.460> talking<00:04:38.639> about<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:39.180> an<00:04:39.270> ant<00:04:39.450> farm

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
keep talking about this as an ant farm

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.200 
keep talking about this as an ant farm
why<00:04:40.169> don't<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:40.410> make<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.160> like<00:04:41.340> an<00:04:41.490> ant<00:04:41.669> farm<00:04:41.760> it

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
why don't we make it like an ant farm it

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.210 
why don't we make it like an ant farm it
is<00:04:42.510> very<00:04:42.720> much<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.380> know<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.650> GI<00:04:43.800> Joe<00:04:43.889> base

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
is very much you know the GI Joe base

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.680 
is very much you know the GI Joe base
that<00:04:44.400> ever<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.729> kid<00:04:44.970> down<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> street<00:04:45.330> had

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
that ever the kid down the street had

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.450 
that ever the kid down the street had
that<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.740> didn't<00:04:46.979> have<00:04:47.040> that<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.280> got<00:04:47.370> to

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that you you didn't have that you got to

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.650 
that you you didn't have that you got to
play<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:47.760> everyone<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.270> well<00:04:48.389> if<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.510> went

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
play with everyone so well if you went

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.190 
play with everyone so well if you went
to<00:04:48.690> his<00:04:48.810> house<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.530> when<00:04:49.979> we<00:04:50.070> when<00:04:50.370> we<00:04:50.400> made<00:04:50.669> it

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
to his house so when we when we made it

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.969 
to his house so when we when we made it
that<00:04:52.200> was<00:04:52.320> one<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> things<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.830> think

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
that was one of the things I think

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.710 
that was one of the things I think
really<00:04:53.280> really<00:04:53.639> stands<00:04:54.090> out<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.389> I<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:54.600> it's

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
really really stands out it I think it's

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.390 
really really stands out it I think it's
a<00:04:54.750> really<00:04:54.780> unique<00:04:55.260> features<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.919> game<00:04:56.100> it

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
a really unique features to the game it

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.100 
a really unique features to the game it
allows<00:04:56.850> us<00:04:57.060> a<00:04:57.180> lot<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.360> flexibility<00:04:57.900> for

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
allows us a lot of flexibility for

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.379 
allows us a lot of flexibility for
optimization<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.220> for<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> player<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.270> be

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
optimization and for the player to be

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.750 
optimization and for the player to be
able<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.570> build<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.200> expand<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:02.610> in

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
able to build and expand and it's in

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.000 
able to build and expand and it's in
it's<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.970> really<00:05:03.240> different<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.990> haven't<00:05:04.889> seen

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
it's a really different I haven't seen

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.400 
it's a really different I haven't seen
represented<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.580> way<00:05:05.900> really<00:05:06.900> ever<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.320> on

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
represented that way really ever and on

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.230 
represented that way really ever and on
top<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.860> they're<00:05:08.160> actually<00:05:08.310> expanding

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
top of that they're actually expanding

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.480 
top of that they're actually expanding
the<00:05:09.330> structure<00:05:09.870> customizing<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.919> facilities

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
the structure customizing the facilities

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.280 
the structure customizing the facilities
that<00:05:11.760> their<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.450> they're<00:05:12.600> adding<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.139> their

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
that their that they're adding to their

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.590 
that their that they're adding to their
base<00:05:13.500> we<00:05:13.800> want<00:05:14.100> them<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.580> be<00:05:14.729> able<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:15.090> see

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
base we want them to be able to see

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.000 
base we want them to be able to see
their<00:05:15.780> soldiers<00:05:16.139> interacting<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:16.889> their

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
their soldiers interacting and their

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.000 
their soldiers interacting and their
scientists<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:18.900> it's<00:05:19.740> this

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
scientists and and so I think it's this

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.040 
scientists and and so I think it's this
really<00:05:20.070> neat<00:05:20.820> moment<00:05:21.180> where<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.690> get<00:05:21.870> into

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
really neat moment where you get into

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.690 
really neat moment where you get into
the<00:05:22.139> game<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.860> have<00:05:23.100> this<00:05:23.400> physical

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
the game and you have this physical

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.820 
the game and you have this physical
structure<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.450> you've<00:05:24.600> customized<00:05:25.289> and

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
structure that you've customized and

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.800 
structure that you've customized and
you've<00:05:26.370> made<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.760> decisions<00:05:27.240> about<00:05:27.360> what<00:05:27.690> you

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
you've made the decisions about what you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.570 
you've made the decisions about what you
want<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.050> focus<00:05:28.260> on<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.830> then<00:05:28.950> you<00:05:29.100> can<00:05:29.310> see

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
want to focus on and then you can see

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.820 
want to focus on and then you can see
your<00:05:29.970> soldiers<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.990> you've<00:05:31.139> leveled<00:05:31.380> up<00:05:31.650> and

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
your soldiers that you've leveled up and

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.080 
your soldiers that you've leveled up and
you've<00:05:31.919> grown<00:05:32.130> attached<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.789> can<00:05:32.940> see

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
you've grown attached to you can see

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.670 
you've grown attached to you can see
them<00:05:33.300> interacting<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.169> it's<00:05:34.350> something<00:05:34.560> that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
them interacting and it's something that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.050 
them interacting and it's something that
I<00:05:34.830> think<00:05:34.889> we're<00:05:35.160> really<00:05:35.340> proud<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.669> really

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
I think we're really proud of really

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.920 
I think we're really proud of really
excited<00:05:36.450> for<00:05:36.600> people<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.870> see

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.960 

Oh
