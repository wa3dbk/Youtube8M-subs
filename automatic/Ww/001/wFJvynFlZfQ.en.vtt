00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.590

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.689
 First of all, what is the question 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.189
 current home depot lists surf person 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.680

00:00:33.680 --> 00:01:03.230
 best presents itself but not with it 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.030
 Of course, enough deadpool is not 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.620

 more of course, by such small ones 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.350
 also presented films for 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.950
 Comics newbies let the story be good 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.950
 understand 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.140
 how was that the duty of the x-men 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.140
 blackbirds no problem 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.340
 but we will come back for the first time 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.080
 to play the game consists of several 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.550
 Share the largest part of the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.740
 fighting the fight takes place above all else 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.420
 city ​​with qatar one swords and two 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.070
 guns after that you can have more 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.800
 Unlock things among them 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.930
 For example, the penny is the one before 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.700
 good for everything big and long 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.770
 make combo chains and you like that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.110
 slowly but surely your opponents completely 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.110
 just bleed and play 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.829
 then comes the heavy banging with the 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.480
 especially good opponents 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.010
 can control and minor 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.010
 opponents can easily come to 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:42.200
 his pistols join and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:48.380
 after shotgun little minute and one 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 There are still laser pulses 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.790
 all kinds of stun grenade blast 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 Skating bears fall and fall 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.510
 Of course, these weapons can also be 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.640
 upgrade accordingly and as I said 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.260
 unlock first I have here already 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 all weapons and objects 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.319
 unlocked but they let themselves 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.760
 of course, of course 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.620
 you can improve your life energy 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.480
 you can improve your ammunition 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.190
 capacity for best minds new skills 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.720
 you can you can you 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.500
 You can do so much and so much 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.390
 unlock 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.819
 There you will definitely get some 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.500
 have to do so collects 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.480
 while playing a big one 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 arsenal and so you can then 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.130
 each situation differently and with 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.910
 another weapon has different tactics 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.680
 strike 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.410
 every now and then comes in something 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.090
 bigger around the drops bigger 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.100
 opponent because he does not just fight here 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.319
 against normal opponents most of the time 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.019
 make cannon fodder but also against 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.060
 slightly larger and stronger opponents and im 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.579
 later gameplay then against 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.150
 bossgegner then a smaller tactics 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.150
 desire 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.560
 in addition to the fight the most part 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.910
 There is still a lot to take in the game 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.190
 different jumping craft and 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.540
 switch puzzle among others here one 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.120
 hop insert I 'll show you once 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.819
 The more spectacular succeeded 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.860
 is the others are something of him 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.300
 easier nature later in the course 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.040
 you can then too 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.410
 different places porten if you 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.049
 got the long board and so will 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.730
 the jumping puzzles are still something 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:29.580
 spectacular and something 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:31.560
 more varied during the course 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.690
 the game does not take place at any time 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.820
 serious and so goes in the middle of the game that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 budget for lids out and it gets too 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.740
 an 8 bit jump'n'run game 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.260
 not only does the game take itself 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.150
 on the arm but the whole gaming and 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.210
 Comic culture and that makes the game 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.770
 really good, but there are, too 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.450
 Some things do not do the game so well 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.910
 makes the graphics so maximum 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.250
 mediocre and the fighting system is too 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.720
 nothing new from the technical point of view 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.880
 The game makes this an acceptable one 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 fig it runs on the hill engine and 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.390
 the relatively fluid it comes here and there 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.450
 times as a few frame burglars but 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.710
 they are not worth talking about 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.750
 Thus, the question arises 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.760
 play something for me and this question is 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.590
 relatively easy to answer if you 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.360
 with humor could do something and 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.100
 here at the setting or while the 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.390
 instead of a little smile 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.310
 then the game to definitely 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.440
 really recommend that it consistently 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.230
 funny and not repeated in 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.360
 you should be particularly funny on komik 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.100
 the marvel universe should be yours 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.700
 being familiar is the game too 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.040
 recommend 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.540
 It is not a simple license crutch like 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.580
 maybe other games 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.930
 you should only have the gameplay 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.150
 I would rather be interested then 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.070
 current games like batman or devil 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.810
 May cry tend because they do that 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.910
 fight a little better 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.650
 but if you are crazy 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.110
 could make friends then you should 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.790
 mm ogh to beat because there is that 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.370
 play for free and then send 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:47.020
 you the game on a long journey the 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.280
 you certainly will not forget 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.930
 I thank all the audience 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.300
 and I hope you could do a little 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.860
 insight into the game we get to see 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.870
 We will definitely be back next time 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.490
 mmo via video if you like the whole 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.490
 People liked until then
