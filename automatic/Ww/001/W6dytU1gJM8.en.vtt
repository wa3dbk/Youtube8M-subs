and I'm sure it was stolen that at the
time<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.869> turnover<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.579> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
administration it's two years old I'm

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.289 
administration it's two years old I'm
sure<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.520> they've<00:01:46.640> been<00:01:46.820> holding<00:01:47.030> it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
sure it is and they've been holding it

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.600 
sure it is and they've been holding it
for<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.570> juicy<00:01:48.020> time<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.219> think<00:01:49.280> they've

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
for a juicy time and I think they've

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.670 
for a juicy time and I think they've
thrown<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:49.969> out<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.240> effect<00:01:50.570> Hatfield

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
thrown it out to effect Hatfield

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.850 
thrown it out to effect Hatfield
on<00:01:52.100> estimate<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:53.510> it's<00:01:53.540> it's<00:01:54.200> something<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
on estimate but it's it's something that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.740
