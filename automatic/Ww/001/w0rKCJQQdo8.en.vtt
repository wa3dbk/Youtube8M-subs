changer in there and see this one is an
option<00:03:41.660> grade<00:03:41.900> four<00:03:42.230> B

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.539 

I'm<00:03:50.060> sure<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:50.599> probably<00:03:50.750> hear<00:03:51.549> the

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
I'm sure you can probably hear the

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.910 
I'm sure you can probably hear the
aircon<00:03:52.970> works<00:03:53.239> nicely

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
aircon works nicely

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.589 
aircon works nicely
I<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.640> quickly<00:03:55.849> show<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.300> all<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
I just quickly show you that all the

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.000 
I just quickly show you that all the
windows<00:03:56.750> work<00:03:57.530> we<00:03:58.430> got<00:03:58.580> one<00:03:58.790> touch<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.770> see<00:04:00.980> a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
windows work we got one touch and see a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.290 
windows work we got one touch and see a
little<00:04:01.280> bit<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.520> tent<00:04:01.790> on<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.910> back<00:04:02.120> one

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
little bit of a tent on the back one

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.180 
little bit of a tent on the back one
there<00:04:02.950> like<00:04:03.950> was<00:04:04.190> on<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.520> other<00:04:04.670> side<00:04:06.190> we've

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
there like was on the other side we've

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:22.090 
there like was on the other side we've
also<00:04:07.370> got<00:04:12.069> power<00:04:13.069> windows<00:04:13.100> there<00:04:20.950> I'll<00:04:21.950> just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
also got power windows there I'll just

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.350 
also got power windows there I'll just
give<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> engine<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.700> little<00:04:22.880> bit<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.150> rev

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
give the engine a little bit of a rev

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.610 
give the engine a little bit of a rev
and<00:04:23.630> we'll<00:04:23.720> hop<00:04:23.840> out<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.020> have<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> look<00:04:24.410> at<00:04:24.500> it

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
and we'll hop out and have a look at it

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.560 
and we'll hop out and have a look at it
so<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.550> two<00:04:25.820> point<00:04:26.120> six<00:04:26.870> liter

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.750 

six-cylinder<00:04:31.570> engine<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> like<00:04:32.590> over<00:04:32.920> 4,000

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
six-cylinder engine I like over 4,000

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.890 
six-cylinder engine I like over 4,000
but<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:33.910> can<00:04:34.030> see<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.360> can<00:04:34.510> hold<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.870> there

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
but you can see if I can hold it there

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.510 
but you can see if I can hold it there
it's<00:04:35.230> just<00:04:35.440> running<00:04:35.620> beautifully<00:04:38.190> out<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.400> all

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
it's just running beautifully out of all

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.360 
it's just running beautifully out of all
the<00:04:39.610> C<00:04:39.820> classes<00:04:40.800> certainly<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.890> is<00:04:42.040> probably

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
the C classes certainly this is probably

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.210 
the C classes certainly this is probably
the<00:04:42.490> most<00:04:42.640> reliable<00:04:43.530> out<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.740> all<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.070> them

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
the most reliable out of all of them

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.340 
the most reliable out of all of them
because<00:04:45.460> there<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.940> least<00:04:46.480> strain<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.260> the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
because there is the least strain on the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.150 
because there is the least strain on the
engine<00:04:47.680> for<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.010> size<00:04:48.340> car<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:49.950> little<00:04:50.950> bit

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
engine for this size car a little bit

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160 
engine for this size car a little bit
hard<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.430> see<00:04:51.730> but<00:04:51.760> there's<00:04:52.120> no<00:04:52.570> oil<00:04:52.600> leaks

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
hard to see but there's no oil leaks

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.060 
hard to see but there's no oil leaks
down<00:04:53.530> there

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
down there

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.670 
down there
it's<00:04:54.760> spotlessly<00:04:55.300> clean

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.939 

so<00:05:01.680> they<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.250> beautiful<00:05:02.520> see<00:05:03.000> 240<00:05:03.949> thanks

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
so they have it beautiful see 240 thanks

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.370 
so they have it beautiful see 240 thanks
for<00:05:05.040> watching
