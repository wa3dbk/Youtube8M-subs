00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
here and into the project will choose

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
here and into the project will choose
first<00:01:29.340> PMG<00:01:30.740> go<00:01:31.740> down<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.520> tab

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
first PMG go down here this is our tab

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.810 
first PMG go down here this is our tab
to<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> same<00:01:34.860> thing<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.280> label<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> down

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to do the same thing we label it down

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.030 
to do the same thing we label it down
here<00:01:36.150> tab<00:01:36.450> 2<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:40.820> we'll<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> image

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
here tab 2 and we'll make the image

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.999 
here tab 2 and we'll make the image
second<00:01:44.040> PNG<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.829> don't<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> label<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
second PNG I don't put a label in on the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.440 
second PNG I don't put a label in on the
label<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:51.890> tab<00:01:52.890> 2<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:56.299> will<00:01:57.299> also

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
label this one tab 2 and will also

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.100 
label this one tab 2 and will also
change<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> color<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> background<00:02:00.110> meat

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
change the color of the background meat

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.690 
change the color of the background meat
is<00:02:01.259> purple<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:03.530> we'll<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:07.489> gray

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
is purple and we'll make this one gray

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.440 
is purple and we'll make this one gray
okay<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.040> basically<00:02:12.220> how<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:13.000> set<00:02:13.330> up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
okay so that's basically how we set up

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.080 
okay so that's basically how we set up
two<00:02:13.660> tabs<00:02:14.849> if<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.000> want<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.239> add<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> third<00:02:16.660> tab

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
two tabs if you want to add a third tab

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.320 
two tabs if you want to add a third tab
it's<00:02:19.090> pretty<00:02:19.330> straightforward<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.910> remove

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
it's pretty straightforward will remove

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.259 
it's pretty straightforward will remove
these<00:02:22.450> out<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> way<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.730> we'll<00:02:24.730> drag<00:02:25.030> in

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
these out of the way and we'll drag in

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.750 
these out of the way and we'll drag in
from<00:02:25.720> our<00:02:25.840> objects<00:02:26.410> another<00:02:26.800> view<00:02:26.980> controller

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.710 

you'll<00:02:30.760> go<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.970> your<00:02:31.150> tab<00:02:31.420> bar<00:02:31.690> controller

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you'll go to your tab bar controller

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.320 
you'll go to your tab bar controller
hold<00:02:32.680> down<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.950> control<00:02:33.640> key<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:34.209> your

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
hold down the control key on your

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.070 
hold down the control key on your
computer<00:02:35.110> click<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.980> drag<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.760> release<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
computer click and drag and release and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.270 
computer click and drag and release and
choose<00:02:38.380> relationship<00:02:39.160> view<00:02:40.000> controllers

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
choose relationship view controllers

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.089 
choose relationship view controllers
then<00:02:42.280> we'll<00:02:42.400> add<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.880> third<00:02:43.120> tab<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.950> we'll

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
then we'll add in a third tab so we'll

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.610 
then we'll add in a third tab so we'll
go<00:02:45.250> down<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.640> here<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.709> we'll<00:02:48.190> call<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.610> tab

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
go down to here and we'll call this tab

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.680 
go down to here and we'll call this tab
3<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.900> we'll<00:02:52.900> give<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:55.950> another

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
3 and we'll give this one another

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.699 
3 and we'll give this one another
graphic<00:03:00.209> we'll<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.390> dragging<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.290> this

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
graphic we'll just dragging then this

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:11.729 
graphic we'll just dragging then this
time<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:04.500> round<00:03:06.000> rectangle<00:03:07.000> button<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.170> we'll

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
time a round rectangle button and we'll

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:21.740 
time a round rectangle button and we'll
