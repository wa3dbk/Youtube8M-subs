00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 how to run the procedure 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.380
 recovery on laptops 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.680
 almost everyone 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.770
 so do not specifically indicate 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.070
 specific model include start need 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.630
 get into bios such step 2 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.080
 Immediately after turning it on, press it for now. 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.220
 will not beep sound run into bios 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.940
 We are either looking for us on the security tab for 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.850
 boot tab 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.220
 looking for the secure boot line 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.090
 here it is on the tab we will have them we 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.030
 see the secure boot line 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.390
 she is not active with us 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.580
 but in order to change its status 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 we just need to change the boot mode 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:07.820
 choose not to leave legacy good 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.979
 legacy I fight choose a line a 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.240
 secure boot gets really we 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.380
 reboot and alt keyboard shortcut 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.159
 f10 we start directly utility 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.159
 of setting 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.390
 Further we select the equipment on 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.990
 keyboard layout 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.640
 Further diagnosis options here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 turn off the computer continue 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 use windows 8 as usual 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.010
 either use a boot device 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.910
 Well, in principle, we can choose what 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:02.930
 there is in the utility further recover 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.480
 you can try to install the download 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.610
 if broken 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.190
 here you can return to its original state 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.190
 at the wedding is an end in itself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.290
 brandy but rumors 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.150
 and you can mean two options just 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.569
 Pour my files as I understand it fast 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 formatting and completely cleans the disk 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.129
 this is a full format fragment in 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.319
 principle, we are full to nothing it will take 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.540
 much more time we just remove 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.599
 delete the files and click the button 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.260
 return to the original state further to us 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.840
 it remains to wait for the end 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.890
 the reset procedure here will seem a percentage 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.970
 up to 100 percent comes and roughly speaking 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.150
 he will return to the factory settings your 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.980
 computer after the procedure 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.739
 restore or reset 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.290
 prese mgu as it was written can 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.299
 give you this message is not exactly 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.160
 maybe he will fly out means 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.280
 correct it as follows will return 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 back legacy bios to boot mode to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.049
 mode and milestones 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.049
 save and reload 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 now we see the download went from and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.299
 it remains only to perform the initial 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.220
