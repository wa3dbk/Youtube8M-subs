00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
called the Zeppelin mod I have done a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.370 
called the Zeppelin mod I have done a
video<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> past<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.020> taken

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
video on this in the past it was taken

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.810 
video on this in the past it was taken
down<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.710> i<00:00:22.740> figured<00:00:23.160> i<00:00:23.310> would<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.580> ahead<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
down so i figured i would go ahead and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.099 
down so i figured i would go ahead and
re-upload<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> different<00:00:24.960> orientation

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
re-upload a different orientation

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.349 
re-upload a different orientation
different<00:00:25.859> viewpoint<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.699> video<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
different viewpoint of this video so

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.250

of size 10 that means that found nine

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
of size 10 that means that found nine
will<00:01:25.170> blocks<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.070> i<00:01:26.100> found<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.369> craft

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
will blocks and i found this craft

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
will blocks and i found this craft
controller<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.259> controllers<00:01:28.740> are<00:01:28.829> pretty

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
controller so the controllers are pretty

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.450 
controller so the controllers are pretty
easy<00:01:29.280> easy<00:01:29.790> said<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> done<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:32.130> use<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
easy easy said and done you use the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.819 
easy easy said and done you use the
number<00:01:32.610> pad<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.329> keyboard<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> that's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
number pad on your keyboard and that's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.530 
number pad on your keyboard and that's
the<00:01:34.950> only<00:01:34.979> way<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.310> far<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.329> think

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the only way so far to use it i think

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.480 
the only way so far to use it i think
you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.810> rearrange<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.409> numbers<00:01:37.439> within<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you can rearrange the numbers within a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
you can rearrange the numbers within a
text<00:01:38.759> file<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.150> i'm<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> sure<00:01:39.420> haven't<00:01:39.960> done

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
text file but i'm not sure haven't done

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.310 
text file but i'm not sure haven't done
it<00:01:40.200> yet<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.790> anyways<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.360> plus<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.140> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it yet so anyways you use plus to go up

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
it yet so anyways you use plus to go up
or<00:01:43.560> ascend<00:01:44.899> use-<00:01:45.899> 2d<00:01:46.500> send<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.430> gets<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
or ascend use- 2d send you gets even a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
or ascend use- 2d send you gets even a
word<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> use<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.820> left<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:52.409> six

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
word you use for to go left and then six

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
word you use for to go left and then six
to<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:53.970> by<00:01:54.320> incremental

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to go right and it's all by incremental

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
to go right and it's all by incremental
so<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:56.040> keep<00:01:56.219> pressing<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.700> it'll<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.000> faster

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
so if i keep pressing it it'll go faster

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
so if i keep pressing it it'll go faster
I<00:01:57.689> keep<00:01:58.560> pressing<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> other<00:01:59.040> way<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I keep pressing the other way and you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
I keep pressing the other way and you
can<00:01:59.969> also<00:02:00.119> use<00:02:00.420> five<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.439> stop<00:02:01.920> everything<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
can also use five to stop everything and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.959 
can also use five to stop everything and
eight<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.200> forward<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.369> no<00:02:05.549> reverse

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
eight to go forward there is no reverse

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.180 
eight to go forward there is no reverse
I'm<00:02:06.600> guessing<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.140> f1's<00:02:07.560> never<00:02:07.829> did<00:02:08.069> have

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I'm guessing because f1's never did have

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.089 
I'm guessing because f1's never did have
reverses<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.030> reverse<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.920> probably

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
reverses so reverse so that's probably

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.020 
reverses so reverse so that's probably
why<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.400> wasn't<00:02:11.550> implemented<00:02:12.030> but

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
why it wasn't implemented but

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910 
why it wasn't implemented but
this<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.450> probably<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.380> best<00:02:14.590> mods

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
this is probably one of the best mods

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.530 
this is probably one of the best mods
that<00:02:15.069> I've<00:02:15.220> seen<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.610> date<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.120> really

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
chest because it just whoo I did not

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.810 
chest because it just whoo I did not
mean<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.940> do<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.980> now<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.010> need<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> white<00:05:00.580> oh

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
mean to do that now I need a white oh

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.700 
mean to do that now I need a white oh
well<00:05:01.270> it'll<00:05:01.900> stay<00:05:02.140> like<00:05:02.170> that<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:03.430> fine

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
well it'll stay like that it's fine

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.200 
well it'll stay like that it's fine

anyway see items fall out of the chest

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.650 
anyway see items fall out of the chest
so<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.420> really<00:05:07.930> can't<00:05:08.260> use<00:05:08.830> chest<00:05:09.250> on<00:05:09.660> these

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
so you really can't use chest on these

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.280 
so you really can't use chest on these
ships<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.240> unfortunately<00:05:13.240> hopefully<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:14.230> the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
ships so unfortunately hopefully in the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.740 
ships so unfortunately hopefully in the
future<00:05:14.470> they'll<00:05:15.010> change<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:16.450> you<00:05:16.540> can

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
future they'll change that but you can

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.270 
future they'll change that but you can
use<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.080> crafting<00:05:17.440> mention<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.920> course<00:05:18.130> you

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
use the crafting mention of course you

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.520 
use the crafting mention of course you
can<00:05:18.460> use<00:05:18.670> this<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:19.090> would<00:05:19.510> not<00:05:19.690> advise<00:05:20.110> having

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
can use this I would not advise having

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.870 
can use this I would not advise having
anything<00:05:20.710> in<00:05:20.980> here<00:05:21.220> on<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> furnace<00:05:21.760> I

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
anything in here on the furnace I

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.820 
anything in here on the furnace I
haven't<00:05:22.060> tried<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.300> yet<00:05:22.450> but<00:05:22.780> i'm<00:05:23.170> pretty<00:05:23.560> sure

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
haven't tried it yet but i'm pretty sure

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.380 
haven't tried it yet but i'm pretty sure
you'll<00:05:23.980> lose<00:05:24.160> those<00:05:24.340> items<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.790> also<00:05:25.980> the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
you'll lose those items to also the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.110 
you'll lose those items to also the
ladders<00:05:28.390> go<00:05:28.600> away<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:30.520> door<00:05:30.730> goes<00:05:30.940> away

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
ladders go away and the door goes away

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.870 
ladders go away and the door goes away
so<00:05:32.080> i<00:05:32.110> wouldn't<00:05:32.620> advise<00:05:32.830> parking<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.550> leaving

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
so i wouldn't advise parking and leaving

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.820 
so i wouldn't advise parking and leaving
it<00:05:33.970> running<00:05:34.320> because<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.440> might<00:05:35.560> have<00:05:35.680> some

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
it running because you might have some

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.020 
it running because you might have some
creepers<00:05:36.190> coming<00:05:36.460> in<00:05:36.750> but<00:05:37.750> as<00:05:37.930> soon<00:05:38.050> as<00:05:38.200> you

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
creepers coming in but as soon as you

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.570 
creepers coming in but as soon as you
put<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.060> back<00:05:40.590> your<00:05:41.590> ladders<00:05:41.950> come<00:05:42.160> back<00:05:42.340> and

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
put it back your ladders come back and
