00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
time I saw it I thought it looked like a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880

of like it and it is original and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
of like it and it is original and
judging<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> amount<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.519> things<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.939> Joe

Berg's<00:01:06.390> roads<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.290> design<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> more

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

now<00:01:41.380> make<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> bit<00:01:41.860> more<00:01:41.890> sense<00:01:42.070> given<00:01:42.640> that

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
now make a bit more sense given that

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.700 
now make a bit more sense given that
it's<00:01:42.880> got<00:01:43.030> all-wheel-drive<00:01:43.420> although<00:01:44.380> being

a hatchback that bit of technology
really<00:01:47.049> serves<00:01:47.350> only<00:01:47.590> one<00:01:47.770> purpose<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.700> that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
really serves only one purpose and that

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.020 
really serves only one purpose and that
purpose<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.409> better<00:01:50.770> traction<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.429> less<00:01:51.759> than

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
purpose is better traction on less than

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.999 
purpose is better traction on less than
even<00:01:52.270> ground<00:01:52.690> now<00:01:53.229> I<00:01:53.259> don't<00:01:53.440> mean<00:01:53.710> less<00:01:53.979> than

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
even ground now I don't mean less than

it's<00:01:56.229> more<00:01:56.409> like<00:01:56.560> tackling<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.429> dirt<00:01:57.670> road

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940
