powered by light art from burning man
was<00:00:40.730> definitely<00:00:41.270> what<00:00:41.480> inspired<00:00:41.930> me<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.170> do

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
was definitely what inspired me to do

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.150 
was definitely what inspired me to do
this<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:44.150> see<00:00:44.420> all<00:00:44.630> this<00:00:44.810> art<00:00:45.320> being<00:00:45.650> put<00:00:46.010> up

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
this to see all this art being put up

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.950 
this to see all this art being put up
and<00:00:46.340> how<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:46.520> was<00:00:46.610> put<00:00:46.820> together<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.510> know<00:00:47.660> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
and how it was put together you know and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.229 
and how it was put together you know and
noticing<00:00:48.680> their<00:00:48.829> use<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:48.980> light<00:00:49.400> trigger<00:00:49.940> like

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
noticing their use of light trigger like

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.880 
noticing their use of light trigger like
hey<00:00:50.480> there's<00:00:50.780> something<00:00:51.050> else<00:00:51.290> you<00:00:51.500> can<00:00:51.530> do

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
hey there's something else you can do

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.340 
hey there's something else you can do
with<00:00:51.920> lampwork<00:00:52.910> glass<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.600> they<00:00:53.810> don't<00:00:54.079> do

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
with lampwork glass that they don't do

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.580 
with lampwork glass that they don't do
we<00:00:54.890> can<00:00:55.070> add<00:00:55.820> multiple<00:00:56.329> sections<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.260> make

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
we can add multiple sections and make

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.900 
we can add multiple sections and make
complex<00:00:58.070> single<00:00:59.059> objects<00:01:00.340> each<00:01:01.340> individual

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
complex single objects each individual

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.719 
complex single objects each individual
piece<00:01:02.180> can<00:01:02.420> have<00:01:02.630> multiple<00:01:03.530> components<00:01:04.189> and

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
piece can have multiple components and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:19.440 
piece can have multiple components and
we<00:01:05.539> can<00:01:05.689> arrange<00:01:05.960> those<00:01:06.319> like<00:01:07.249> an<00:01:07.399> organism

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.330 

you<00:01:19.930> know<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.289> was<00:01:20.409> just<00:01:20.439> steamed<00:01:20.770> glass<00:01:21.009> pipes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
you know it was just steamed glass pipes

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.370 
you know it was just steamed glass pipes
and<00:01:21.579> I<00:01:21.670> was<00:01:21.820> younger<00:01:22.149> and<00:01:22.509> I<00:01:22.719> wonder<00:01:23.200> how<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
and I was younger and I wonder how the

and I was younger and I wonder how the
hell<00:01:23.469> they<00:01:23.710> made<00:01:23.860> these<00:01:24.039> things<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.670> know<00:01:24.700> and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.459 
hell they made these things you know and
that<00:01:25.600> kind<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.250> led<00:01:27.250> me<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.670> journey<00:01:28.469> you

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
that kind of led me on a journey you

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.340 
that kind of led me on a journey you
know<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:30.250> find<00:01:30.969> out<00:01:31.149> how<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.929> is<00:01:32.110> done

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
know to find out how this is done

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.460 
know to find out how this is done
eventually<00:01:33.189> took<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.700> class<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.719> summer<00:01:35.289> class

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
eventually took a class a summer class

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.800 
eventually took a class a summer class
to<00:01:35.740> make<00:01:35.890> paper<00:01:36.130> weights<00:01:36.429> at<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> hot<00:01:37.539> glass

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
to make paper weights at a hot glass

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.179 
to make paper weights at a hot glass
studio<00:01:38.140> had<00:01:38.350> nothing<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:38.740> do<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:38.979> pipe

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
studio had nothing to do with pipe

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.370 
studio had nothing to do with pipe
