this other stuff but I'm kind of excited
about<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.630> game<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.130> games<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.699> tell

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
about this game I I like games that tell

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
about this game I I like games that tell
a<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.240> good<00:00:30.359> story<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> think<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
a really good story now I think that is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
a really good story now I think that is
a<00:00:32.279> key<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> order<00:00:33.989> 1886<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.829> be

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a key for the order 1886 to be

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
a key for the order 1886 to be
successful<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.210> needs<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> tell<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
successful I think it needs to tell a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.830 
successful I think it needs to tell a
very<00:00:37.260> good<00:00:37.530> story<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.190> else<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.879> won't<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.270> but

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
very good story or else it won't be but

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.049 
very good story or else it won't be but
that<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.200> only<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.860> game<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.520> filled<00:00:41.940> with

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
that is only if the game is filled with

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
that is only if the game is filled with
QTEs<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.170> mean<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:43.530> only<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.129> two

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
QTEs I mean there's only been what two

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.910 
QTEs I mean there's only been what two
or<00:00:44.430> three<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.000> four<00:00:45.030> demos<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.530> game<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
or three or four demos of the game that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
or three or four demos of the game that
people<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.250> been<00:00:47.370> able<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> play<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.600> who

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
really about but it does excite me a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
really about but it does excite me a
little<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.800> trying<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> keep<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.969> hopes

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
little and I'm trying to keep my hopes

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560

you know my expectations low because of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.939 
you know my expectations low because of
all<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> things<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.500> saying<00:01:01.800> about

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
all the things people are saying about

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.189 
all the things people are saying about
it<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> problem<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it but I don't see what the problem is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
it but I don't see what the problem is
and<00:01:04.409> what's<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:04.949> weird<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> me<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> game

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and what's really weird to me is a game

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330 
and what's really weird to me is a game
like<00:01:06.150> until<00:01:06.570> dawn<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.170> getting<00:01:07.619> tons<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
like until dawn is getting tons of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.789 
like until dawn is getting tons of
praise<00:01:08.580> tons<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.390> people<00:01:09.630> love<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
praise tons of people love it and it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.820 
praise tons of people love it and it
looks<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.430> even<00:01:11.760> less<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.689> real<00:01:13.409> game

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
looks like it's even less of a real game

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.810 
looks like it's even less of a real game
than<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.210> order<00:01:15.450> 1886<00:01:15.890> I'm<00:01:16.890> excited<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.549> both

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
than the order 1886 I'm excited for both

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
than the order 1886 I'm excited for both
games<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:18.869> observation<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
games this is just my observation of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
games this is just my observation of
what<00:01:20.490> people<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.880> saying<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.360> both<00:01:21.750> these

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
what people are saying about both these

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
what people are saying about both these
games<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.100> doesn't<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.790> sense

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
games and it doesn't really make sense

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.649 
games and it doesn't really make sense
to<00:01:24.240> me

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to me

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.300 
to me
now<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.320> saying<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> game<00:01:25.890> isn't<00:01:26.189> gonna

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
now I'm not saying the game isn't gonna

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
now I'm not saying the game isn't gonna
come<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> horrible<00:01:27.360> game<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.810> don't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
come out and be a horrible game I don't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
come out and be a horrible game I don't
know<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.310> lot<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> people<00:01:29.820> are

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
know but I think a lot of people are

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
know but I think a lot of people are
jumping<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.509> conclusions<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:32.220> if

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
jumping to conclusions here I think if

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
jumping to conclusions here I think if
it<00:01:32.460> tells<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.970> very<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.540> story<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.530> gonna

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it tells a very good story it's gonna

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
it tells a very good story it's gonna
knock<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> park<00:01:35.790> even<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
knock it out of the park even with the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
games I ever played on PlayStation 3

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
games I ever played on PlayStation 3
there's<00:01:49.380> been<00:01:49.619> games<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.250> done<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there's been games that have done this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
there's been games that have done this
before<00:01:50.610> there's<00:01:51.180> gonna<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.750> games<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.409> it

in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> future<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.000> depends<00:01:54.360> on

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
in the future I think it all depends on

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660 
in the future I think it all depends on
the<00:01:54.540> story<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> gameplay<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> stuff

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the story and the gameplay and stuff

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
the story and the gameplay and stuff
like<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.329> we're<00:01:57.899> gonna<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
like that so we're gonna see when it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
like that so we're gonna see when it
comes<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> February<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.090> last<00:02:00.299> thing<00:02:00.479> I

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
trailing Sony by so much how much we

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.180 
trailing Sony by so much how much we
really<00:03:21.600> don't<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.620> need<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.070> be

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
really don't know but they need to be

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.250 
really don't know but they need to be
decisive<00:03:23.550> with<00:03:23.940> their<00:03:24.090> decisions<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> if

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
decisive with their decisions and if

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.540 
decisive with their decisions and if
they<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.100> they'll<00:03:26.430> be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
they do that I think they'll be

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.340 
they do that I think they'll be
perfectly<00:03:27.000> fine<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.360> think<00:03:27.600> they'll<00:03:27.959> keep<00:03:28.170> up

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
perfectly fine I think they'll keep up

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.470 
perfectly fine I think they'll keep up
with<00:03:28.530> Sony<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.070> maybe<00:03:29.489> even<00:03:29.790> someday<00:03:30.060> past

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
with Sony and maybe even someday past

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.960 
with Sony and maybe even someday past
Sony<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.380> who<00:03:31.530> knows<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> think<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.820> just

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
Sony but who knows but I think it just

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.090 
Sony but who knows but I think it just
sends<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.239> weird<00:03:33.480> message<00:03:33.690> when<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.530> raise<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
sends a weird message when you raise the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.759 
sends a weird message when you raise the
price<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.030> 400<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:37.230> two<00:03:37.500> days

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
price back up to 400 for like two days

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.090 
price back up to 400 for like two days
and<00:03:38.100> then<00:03:38.700> put<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.209> back<00:03:39.360> down<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.600> 350<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.830> just

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
and then put it back down to 350 it just

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.759 
and then put it back down to 350 it just
seems<00:03:41.370> weird<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.120> hopefully<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:43.170> stick<00:03:43.560> with

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
seems weird so hopefully they stick with

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.470 
seems weird so hopefully they stick with
this<00:03:43.920> they're<00:03:44.220> saying<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.180> not<00:03:45.209> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
this they're saying that it is not a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
this they're saying that it is not a
permanent<00:03:45.989> price<00:03:46.440> drop<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.370> almost

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
permanent price drop but I almost

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.550 
permanent price drop but I almost
guarantee<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.360> it's<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.930> permanent<00:03:49.140> price

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
guarantee you it's a permanent price

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.650 
guarantee you it's a permanent price
drop<00:03:49.860> they're<00:03:50.459> there<00:03:50.850> they're<00:03:51.180> gonna<00:03:51.330> see

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
drop they're there they're gonna see

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.290 
drop they're there they're gonna see
what<00:03:52.019> happens<00:03:52.380> these<00:03:52.530> next<00:03:52.920> few<00:03:53.070> months

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
what happens these next few months

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.220 
what happens these next few months
obviously<00:03:54.300> they're<00:03:54.510> not<00:03:54.690> going<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:54.959> do<00:03:55.110> as

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
obviously they're not going to do as

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.020 
obviously they're not going to do as
good<00:03:55.380> as<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.680> did<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:55.890> November<00:03:56.459> December

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
good as they did in November December

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.180 
good as they did in November December
neither<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.780> Sony<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> think<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.070> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
neither is Sony but I think it's the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.190 
neither is Sony but I think it's the
right<00:03:59.340> move<00:03:59.400> and<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.269> always<00:04:00.450> believe<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
right move and I always believe that the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.990 
right move and I always believe that the
cheaper<00:04:01.530> console<00:04:01.980> will<00:04:02.160> always<00:04:02.489> be<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.820> best

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
cheaper console will always be the best

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.850 
cheaper console will always be the best
