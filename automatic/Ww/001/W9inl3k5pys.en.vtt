actually fit really well and I don't
have<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.540> skinny<00:01:42.960> legs<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:44.100> athletic

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
have very skinny legs I have an athletic

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
have very skinny legs I have an athletic
body<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> even<00:01:46.740> though<00:01:46.860> these

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
body so I think that even though these

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
body so I think that even though these
may<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> most<00:01:47.759> expensive<00:01:48.420> boots<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
may not be the most expensive boots and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
may not be the most expensive boots and
they're<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> real<00:01:49.890> leather<00:01:50.130> they're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
they're not real leather they're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.200 
they're not real leather they're
definitely<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.329> great<00:01:51.750> fit<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.579> hard

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
definitely a great fit and that is hard

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
definitely a great fit and that is hard
to<00:01:54.329> beat<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> comes<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.470> knee<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.460> over

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to beat when it comes to knee or over

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
to beat when it comes to knee or over
the<00:01:56.880> knee<00:01:57.030> boots<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> next<00:01:58.409> outfit

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the knee boots now for the next outfit

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
the knee boots now for the next outfit
outfit<00:01:59.340> two<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.909> my<00:02:00.030> opinion<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.540> probably<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
outfit two in my opinion is probably the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
outfit two in my opinion is probably the
most<00:02:01.350> feminine<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.270> it's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
most feminine I like it a lot and it's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
most feminine I like it a lot and it's
something<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.409> i<00:02:04.740> were<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.130> push<00:02:05.280> myself

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
something that if i were to push myself

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.490 
something that if i were to push myself
out<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.000> comfort<00:02:06.149> zone<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.840> would<00:02:06.990> wear<00:02:07.200> and

out of my comfort zone i would wear and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.850 
out of my comfort zone i would wear and
that<00:02:07.700> reason<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.090> because<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.140> involves<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
that reason is because it involves a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.530 
that reason is because it involves a
skirt<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
skirt and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.750
