first look at the Apple watch sport
complete<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.130> its<00:01:32.280> white<00:01:32.549> floral<00:01:33.150> elastomer

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
complete with its white floral elastomer
band<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> fancy<00:01:35.009> word<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
band it's a fancy word and all but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.160 
band it's a fancy word and all but
honestly<00:01:36.180> I've<00:01:36.360> seen<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> watch<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.960> other

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
honestly I've seen the watch with other

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.050 
honestly I've seen the watch with other
bands<00:01:37.439> affixed<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> band<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bands affixed and I think the band is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
bands affixed and I think the band is
probably<00:01:39.420> gonna<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> first<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
probably gonna be the first thing I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
probably gonna be the first thing I
change<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.119> taking<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> box

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
change out so taking it out of the box

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.980 
change out so taking it out of the box
