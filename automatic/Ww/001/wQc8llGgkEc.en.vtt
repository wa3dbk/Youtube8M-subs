Oh<00:00:12.110> fellow<00:00:13.110> woodchopper<00:00:13.500> ooze<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.400> big<00:00:14.670> chop

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
Oh fellow woodchopper ooze the big chop

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.609 
Oh fellow woodchopper ooze the big chop
ruined<00:00:15.740> safety<00:00:16.740> day<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.610> ok<00:00:17.790> and<00:00:18.619> today's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
ruined safety day in here ok and today's

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
ruined safety day in here ok and today's
weekend<00:00:20.189> project<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.849> something<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.509> every

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
weekend project is something that every

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
weekend project is something that every
traditional<00:00:22.500> woodworking<00:00:22.860> shop<00:00:23.520> should<00:00:23.790> have

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
traditional woodworking shop should have

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
traditional woodworking shop should have
and<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.500> glut<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> glut<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> actually

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and that is a glut so a glut is actually

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.269 
and that is a glut so a glut is actually
a<00:00:29.100> wedged<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.510> splitting<00:00:30.930> logs<00:00:31.220> now<00:00:32.220> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a wedged use for splitting logs now the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.549 
a wedged use for splitting logs now the
most<00:00:32.610> common<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.180> you'll<00:00:33.330> see<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
most common one you'll see are one of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.400 
most common one you'll see are one of
these<00:00:34.710> metal<00:00:35.220> ones<00:00:35.420> however<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.720> you<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
these metal ones however if you use this

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.310 
these metal ones however if you use this
you<00:00:37.470> have<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.160> exercise<00:00:38.670> some<00:00:38.699> caution

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
you have to exercise some caution

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.660 
you have to exercise some caution
because<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.949> have<00:00:41.100> metal<00:00:41.489> hitting<00:00:42.120> metal

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
because if you have metal hitting metal

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.189 
because if you have metal hitting metal
there's<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:44.970> chance<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> metal<00:00:45.930> can

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
there's a good chance that the metal can

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.410 
there's a good chance that the metal can
come<00:00:46.409> off<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.589> shrapnel<00:00:47.040> injuring<00:00:47.909> yourself

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
come off as shrapnel injuring yourself

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.579 
come off as shrapnel injuring yourself
so<00:00:49.290> an<00:00:49.440> older<00:00:49.949> but<00:00:50.339> safer<00:00:50.909> method<00:00:51.330> is<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:52.350> make

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
so an older but safer method is to make

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.410 
so an older but safer method is to make
one<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> wood<00:00:55.640> I'm<00:00:56.640> beginning<00:00:57.269> with<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one out of wood I'm beginning with a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380 
one out of wood I'm beginning with a
hardwood<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.589> this<00:00:58.769> case<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.280> maple<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.269> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
hardwood in this case it's maple but you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
hardwood in this case it's maple but you
could<00:01:00.540> also<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:00.869> anything<00:01:01.350> such<00:01:01.799> as<00:01:01.979> Elm

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
could also use anything such as Elm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.380 
could also use anything such as Elm
Hickory<00:01:02.519> or<00:01:02.909> Sycamore<00:01:04.909> I'm<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> add

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Hickory or Sycamore I'm going to add

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
Hickory or Sycamore I'm going to add
this<00:01:06.630> metal<00:01:07.080> band<00:01:07.409> around<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.159> head<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this metal band around the head of the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
this metal band around the head of the
glut<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.600> help<00:01:09.840> prevent<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:10.860> mushrooming

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
glut to help prevent it from mushrooming

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.410 
glut to help prevent it from mushrooming
when<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> strike<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.730> band<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
when I strike it to get the band of it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
when I strike it to get the band of it
I'm<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> turn<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> head<00:01:16.920> down

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I'm going to have to turn the head down

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
I'm going to have to turn the head down
on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.430> lathe<00:01:17.760> so<00:01:18.660> I'm<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.290> find<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
on the lathe so I'm going to find the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.109 
on the lathe so I'm going to find the
center<00:01:20.010> of<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.430> stock

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.999 

the<00:01:26.119> metal<00:01:26.420> banding<00:01:26.840> was<00:01:26.990> some<00:01:27.200> 2<00:01:27.380> inch<00:01:27.530> tubing

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
the metal banding was some 2 inch tubing

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.789 
the metal banding was some 2 inch tubing
from<00:01:28.250> an<00:01:28.430> old<00:01:28.610> agricultural<00:01:29.570> drive<00:01:29.840> shaft<00:01:30.200> I'm

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
from an old agricultural drive shaft I'm

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.340 
from an old agricultural drive shaft I'm
using<00:01:31.490> dial<00:01:31.880> calipers<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.540> measure<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
using dial calipers to measure the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.950 
using dial calipers to measure the
inside<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.340> tubing<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:34.939> lock<00:01:35.509> in<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
inside of the tubing and lock in the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
inside of the tubing and lock in the
measurement

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
measurement

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.460 
measurement
now<00:01:39.280> before<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.670> use<00:01:39.730> my<00:01:40.030> lathe<00:01:40.270> let's<00:01:41.200> take<00:01:41.440> a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
now before I use my lathe let's take a

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.460 
now before I use my lathe let's take a
tip<00:01:41.710> from<00:01:42.510> safety<00:01:43.510> day<00:01:43.660> oh<00:01:44.970> hey<00:01:46.260> always<00:01:47.260> make

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
tip from safety day oh hey always make

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.690 
tip from safety day oh hey always make
sure<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.040> were<00:01:48.160> your<00:01:48.340> hearing

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
sure that you were your hearing

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.020 
sure that you were your hearing
protection<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.510> safety<00:01:49.870> glasses<00:01:51.030> that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
protection and safety glasses that's

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.880 
protection and safety glasses that's
good<00:01:52.210> advice<00:01:52.330> safety<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.530> know<00:01:53.650> when

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
good advice safety but you know when

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.410 
good advice safety but you know when
using<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.340> lathe<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.760> should<00:01:54.970> probably<00:01:55.270> have

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
using a lathe you should probably have

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.540 
using a lathe you should probably have
like<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.630> face<00:01:55.960> shield<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:57.130> not<00:01:57.310> that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
like a face shield and it's not that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.640 
like a face shield and it's not that
loud<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.210> there's<00:01:58.750> no<00:01:58.930> need<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.440> hearing

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
loud so there's no need for the hearing

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.420 
loud so there's no need for the hearing
protection<00:01:59.979> sure<00:02:00.580> just<00:02:01.360> word<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:05.250> turning<00:02:06.250> can

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
protection sure just word of turning can

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.219 
protection sure just word of turning can
be<00:02:06.550> fun<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.270> don't<00:02:07.510> want<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.750> get<00:02:07.840> carried

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
be fun but I don't want to get carried

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.199 
be fun but I don't want to get carried

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
away with it I don't want to turn the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.300 
away with it I don't want to turn the
stock<00:02:10.509> smaller<00:02:11.140> than<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> measurements<00:02:12.190> on

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
stock smaller than the measurements on

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.570 
stock smaller than the measurements on
my<00:02:12.490> calipers<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.240> fact<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.590> want<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> stock<00:02:15.370> to

my calipers in fact I want the stock to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.340 
my calipers in fact I want the stock to
be<00:02:15.700> slightly<00:02:15.970> larger<00:02:16.750> than<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.110> steel<00:02:17.380> ring

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
be slightly larger than the steel ring

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.960 
be slightly larger than the steel ring
once<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.590> turning<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.010> done<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.489> need<00:02:21.820> to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
once the turning is done I need to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.900 
once the turning is done I need to
create<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.510> wedge<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.860> my<00:02:24.040> lines<00:02:24.280> drawn<00:02:24.700> on

create the wedge with my lines drawn on
it<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:25.750> over<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> bandsaw<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:34.180> not

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
it it's now over to the bandsaw it's not

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.440 
it it's now over to the bandsaw it's not
necessary<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:36.040> taking<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.700> sharp<00:02:36.970> corners

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
necessary but I'm taking a sharp corners

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.810 
necessary but I'm taking a sharp corners
off<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.989> edge<00:02:38.170> with<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.070> spokes<00:02:39.340> Shane<00:02:41.820> now

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
off the edge with the spokes Shane now

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.150 
off the edge with the spokes Shane now
as<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.180> mentioned<00:02:43.209> before<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.410> glut<00:02:44.769> head<00:02:44.980> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
as I mentioned before the glut head is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.330 
as I mentioned before the glut head is
larger<00:02:45.760> than<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.000> steel<00:02:46.360> band<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:48.160> make<00:02:48.280> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
larger than the steel band so to make it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.090 
larger than the steel band so to make it
fit<00:02:48.730> I'll<00:02:48.910> heat<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.720> expand<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> band<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:51.070> a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
fit I'll heat and expand the band with a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.520 
fit I'll heat and expand the band with a
propane<00:02:51.489> torch<00:02:54.480> with<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> band<00:02:55.900> heated<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
propane torch with the band heated it

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.880 
propane torch with the band heated it
easily<00:02:57.070> drops<00:02:57.400> over<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> glut<00:02:58.090> head<00:02:58.350> then<00:02:59.350> to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
easily drops over the glut head then to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.560 
easily drops over the glut head then to
shrink<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.250> back<00:03:00.459> down<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.000> form<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.330> tight

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
shrink it back down the form a tight

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.930 
shrink it back down the form a tight
seal<00:03:01.840> I'll<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.769> quench<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.280> with<00:03:03.459> some<00:03:03.670> cool

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
seal I'll just quench it with some cool
