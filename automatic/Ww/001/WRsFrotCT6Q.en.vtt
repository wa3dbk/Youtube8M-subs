00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
defensive approach you may not get kills

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.980 
defensive approach you may not get kills
quite<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.580> fast<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.570> won't<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.869> killed

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
quite as fast but you won't get killed

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.250 
quite as fast but you won't get killed
as<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.770> it'll<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.040> harder<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.400> find

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
as much because it'll be harder to find

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.850 
as much because it'll be harder to find
that's<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.380> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:46.830> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that's the kind of thing that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
that's the kind of thing that
differentiates<00:01:47.400> Sasson<00:01:48.210> screen<00:01:48.390> brotherhood

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and we also like to think that that's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
mission he could die and then you will

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.759 
mission he could die and then you will
never<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.600> access<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.049> assassin<00:04:07.530> again

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
never have access to that assassin again

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.580 
never have access to that assassin again
because<00:04:08.160> he's<00:04:08.190> dead<00:04:09.230> that's<00:04:10.230> about<00:04:10.349> all<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.500> can

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
because he's dead that's about all I can

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.100 
because he's dead that's about all I can
say<00:04:10.950> about<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.550> right<00:04:11.730> now<00:04:11.780> but<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> hope<00:04:12.989> it

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
say about that right now but I hope it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.589 
say about that right now but I hope it
