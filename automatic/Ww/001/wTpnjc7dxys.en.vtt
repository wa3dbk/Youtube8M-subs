that's a pretty good swatch so we're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
that's a pretty good swatch so we're
just<00:02:35.540> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.840> go<00:02:35.930> over<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.110> couple<00:02:36.320> times<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
just going to go over a couple times and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
up to very nice um consistency overall I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.490 
up to very nice um consistency overall I
do<00:02:46.730> like<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.210> consistency<00:02:47.600> instead<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
do like the consistency instead of the

do like the consistency instead of the
payoff<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:48.920> awesome<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.580> not<00:02:49.760> sheet<00:02:50.720> that's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
payoff is awesome it's not sheet that's

payoff is awesome it's not sheet that's
not<00:02:51.110> too<00:02:51.290> sheer<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:52.250> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
not too sheer but it's just like the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.680 
not too sheer but it's just like the
perfect<00:02:52.550> amount<00:02:52.940> it'll<00:02:53.270> give<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> nice

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
perfect amount it'll give you a nice

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.330 
perfect amount it'll give you a nice
amount<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.140> gloss<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.920> next<00:02:54.950> one<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.280> I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
amount of gloss so the next one that I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
guessing is the hell one I just can kind

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.000 
guessing is the hell one I just can kind
of<00:02:59.960> tell<00:03:00.110> by<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.260> color<00:03:00.500> which<00:03:00.770> I'm<00:03:00.890> pretty

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
of tell by the color which I'm pretty

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.240 
of tell by the color which I'm pretty
sure<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.550> for<00:03:02.420> starters<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.110> one<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.740> more

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
sure it is for starters this one is more

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.860 
sure it is for starters this one is more
of<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.490> shimmering<00:03:04.910> product<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> little<00:03:05.780> bit

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
of a shimmering product as a little bit

of tiny tiny specks of shimmer and once

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.690 
of tiny tiny specks of shimmer and once
again<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.320> this<00:03:09.440> one<00:03:09.620> you're<00:03:09.740> getting<00:03:09.890> 0.1

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700

again when you pop it out it has the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.250 
again when you pop it out it has the
spoolie<00:03:22.640> which<00:03:23.300> looks<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.110> can

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
spoolie which looks like this you can

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.310 
spoolie which looks like this you can
probably<00:03:24.440> see<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.740> one<00:03:24.860> better<00:03:26.320> the

fifteen dollars which is what a Mac lip

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.380 
fifteen dollars which is what a Mac lip
gloss<00:04:18.169> kind<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.560> cost<00:04:18.770> so<00:04:19.520> it's<00:04:20.180> not

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
gloss kind of cost so it's not
