00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
with you guys and let you guys know it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.580 
with you guys and let you guys know it
was<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> channel<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.289> things<00:00:22.470> like

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
was up with the channel and things like

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
was up with the channel and things like
that<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> while<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> figured<00:00:24.150> that's

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that in a while so I figured that's

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
that in a while so I figured that's
something<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.840> could<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.590> really

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
something we could do because I really

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.290 
something we could do because I really
haven't<00:00:26.099> been<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.340> active<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:26.849> I've<00:00:27.000> wanted<00:00:27.240> to
