00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 the game character decision 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.140
 Let's talk about the plants 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.000
 is there the peas cannon is fast 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 on foot and carries the fight to the opponent 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
 The sunflower is the healer class 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.040
 she stays behind the front line and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.809
 helps the team mates capable of fighting for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.370
 attitude the snapper is a resourceful 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.260
 melee he is good for 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 blitzes the kag the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 in turn has a high range and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.920
 is the distance shooter of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.059
 how would you plant somebody 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.719
 other shooter knows the special features 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.030
 these game characters explain the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.579
 Peas cannon is a standard attack 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 unit the sunflower of the paramedic 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.439
 said a kind of sniper and the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 Schnapper a melee specialist 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 some favorite tactics that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 Schnapper lightning attack is a great one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.119
 You have to have tactics in the team 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 convince in the next round immediately 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.009
 as a tug to spawn in this way 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.720
 you can surprise the enemy and in the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.640
 Really many enemies turn around 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.560
 eliminate what would be a good one 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 Compilation of game characters 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.009
 I think at least half of the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 team members should be cannibalized as peas 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.400
 play there that the attacking experts 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.140
 that's what the team can do with the zombies 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.610
 Feeling really stressful then feels like 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
 two to three sunflowers a few 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.920
 Schnapper and a few more cactuses than 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920
 support 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.360
 how would you like a shooter fan 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.799
 explain different combinations 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.509
 here the soldier is the typical one 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.070
 offensive character he is easy too 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.140
 learn and play especially for 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 new games of the rocket jump is great 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.899
 because with that you can go upstairs 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.649
 catapult and plant from the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.090
 attack the air 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.799
 The engineer is very clear as 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870
 Support thought he can be protected 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.670
 and teleporter on 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.080
 all and other plants live if you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.010
 As an engineer, you should play 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.170
 not in the middle of the battle 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.320
 better fall behind something and 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 help the others 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.510
 as a scientist, on the other hand, you are on 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.950
 foremost front 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780
 this character is a bit like 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.220
 a scout he is very fast in the middle of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.930
 it can happen like a fight 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 shotgun doing great harm 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.020
 He also has the healing station 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 is the healer class in the zombie 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.410
 team as you play it you decide 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.790
 with over the course of the game which 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.650
 would you like to draw for someone ? 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 the other games of this kind know that 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.620
 may not be completely atypical though 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.240
 rather corresponds to a fight 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.190
 maria powerful but he can also 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.290
 others heal and what can the allstars do 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.820
 the all star is practically an armor he 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.200
 has a lot of life energy and can 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.290
 his teammates with his 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.880
 firearm fire protection in 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.590
 tackling sprint can be effective 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.150
 storm enemy bases and with the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 football cannon dominated the opponent 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.410
 at will 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.840
 what does the perfectly tuned zombie look like 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.040
 Team out I think you have the right one 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.770
 Balance between attack and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.210
 find supportive characters 56 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.430
 soldiers and as help a few 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.260
 engineers and allstars 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.000
 important is that the team on the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.360
 Responding to each fight development 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.520
 can 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.050
 who cares and communicates well 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.890
 Roll depending on the behavior of the plants 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.239
 Changing is clearly in the advantage 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.130
 what is the best way to play if 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.570
 a big bvb-fan is so far but only 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.100
 the strategy game knows with which 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.450
 game character you should start on 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100
 Best for beginners is at the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.660
 Zombies certainly the soldier he has 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.730
