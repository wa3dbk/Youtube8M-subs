00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.929
 welcome back let's play the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 simpsons speeches we'll do it all 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.370
 short a small test and indeed has one 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.290
 update loaded and I actually wanted 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.549
 just look very briefly what happens here 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.300
 looks a bit like amusement park 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:24.689
 from and for city not so happened 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 Now a few new tasks on the left 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.060
 doing that but I can now 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550
 ever do a little something and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.189
 then tomorrow morning, the result 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.719
 dranhÃ¤ngen withdrawn what that changed 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 Thermal underwear waterproof 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 Matches one can because the stuff is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 yes crazy igniter extra long fork 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.370
 something from pippi makes drinking water 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680
 why I have not always been here 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.239
 went shopping 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.070
 buy the bake so in the end their 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.329
 tasks do not start clapping because 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 I thought we first gather this 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 money for the house of toni which now 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 if it does come anything but sees 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.010
 it does not mean that means I have the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.189
 now all work on twelve hours 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
 but sent in the update itself 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.979
 now does not seem right thing to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 happen 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.640
 with the amusement park I do not know 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:25.439
 just that to mean something now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 now has the tasks almost in the first 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.930
 I can go watch here is the same 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.229
 a house due and that of sony 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 that in the house of ciena exactly 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.460
 now with the old omas children 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.450
 Show times if there are any 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.490
 tasks have no 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.149
 then they just leave something 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.399
 make the evening ring 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.640
 okay and since the house was pretty stupid 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.259
 stands and I have already seen that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.439
 a bit of space up here 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:05.119
 could have been here in 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.119
 this beautiful area 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.040
 However, let's see how we take the place 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 behind it a bit more useful 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.610
 can use 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.140
 I hope that I'm just there 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.690
 a road between warriors 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.690
 Probably it is possible once 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.519
 that means you can ask here to the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.019
 also what to do what not that 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.280
 worst is yours now as children 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.379
 Part of the garden of his garage entrance 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.349
 is virtually parked but there are cars 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.849
 yes, this is not meyer and it does not matter 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.620
 I would also say every house from 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.120
 the man sorry again so a bit 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.209
 down 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.980
 that's a little bit the first time 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.329
 look and maybe we have something here 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.310
 because what else is that still built 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.890
 must be photo niess building or something 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.019
 A little pincer on the promenade 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.970
 first tonis building might build 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.110
 Sound that somehow here but me 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:15.900
 make now the cd quality 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:15.900
 Of course, shit out looking forward 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.030
 not more then I push the things 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.130
 else go where that here quite 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.269
 Good from here and I appreciate that we 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.569
 on top of each case a bit now 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.760
 have space for a few other cottages 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:39.160
 or maybe you can watch it 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 which then make up then living children 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 at the city hall and he could theoretically 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.930
 even then, probably first rather have a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.190
 nice place for a nicer and that 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.880
 house of man we make it so share 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.519
 it 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.519
 or he is not so bad 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.639
 yes it we are now else to 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.750
 actually do not do any tours and therefore live 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.139
 I will not be right now 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.700
 big on and wait a moment over 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.840
 night until the tasks are done and 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.930
 hope that tomorrow morning I will be here 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.870
 Still money for Phaeton in the building 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.889
 if not then come from event 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.750
 simply by a little bit on 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.889
 Tomorrow that was after the vacation time 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.039
 on the 12th 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.780
 turn the lock together and 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.560
 will be back in the phase afterwards 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.389
 go over the yard a little bit 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 less often then take a bit 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.860
 more action that means always the money 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.900
 so skip and collect a bit 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.580
 really then only what do we take 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.129
 still pending tasks is more interesting 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.080
 because we already said that before 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.550
 Collecting money for 100 years is not like that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.409
 interesting and therefore first 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.740
 I spend the night almost now and until 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.740
 light
