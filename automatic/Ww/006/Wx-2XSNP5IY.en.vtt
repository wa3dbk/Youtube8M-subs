about throwing a nade even after you

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.980 
about throwing a nade even after you
start<00:00:08.340> diffusing<00:00:08.610> holding<00:00:09.389> an<00:00:09.480> angle<00:00:09.750> as<00:00:09.900> an

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
start diffusing holding an angle as an

start diffusing holding an angle as an
op<00:00:10.110> defusing<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.070> few<00:00:11.580> tricks<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.940> make<00:00:12.090> noise

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
op defusing a few tricks to make noise

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.299 
op defusing a few tricks to make noise
where<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.570> defusing<00:00:12.960> masking<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> defusing

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
where you defusing masking the defusing

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.010 
where you defusing masking the defusing
noise<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.670> Nate's<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.179> tapping<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> bomb

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
noise with Nate's and tapping the bomb

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.689 
noise with Nate's and tapping the bomb
without<00:00:16.350> stopping<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> defuse<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.340> hope<00:00:17.580> you

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
without stopping to defuse it I hope you

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:27.109 
without stopping to defuse it I hope you
enjoy<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.279> previous<00:00:26.490> video<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.090> showed

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
enjoy so in my previous video I showed

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.120 
enjoy so in my previous video I showed
you<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> pull<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> pin<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> name

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you that if you pull the pin on a name

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
you that if you pull the pin on a name
I'm<00:00:29.369> stuck<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.869> throw<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.170> while

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
I'm stuck then you can throw it while

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
I'm stuck then you can throw it while
defusing<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.099> there's<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:33.030> another

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
defusing and there's actually another

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.220 
defusing and there's actually another
way<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> can<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
way that you can do this as well so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
way that you can do this as well so
that's<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:35.100> diffusing<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that's if you start diffusing get out of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
that's if you start diffusing get out of
grenade<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.600> hold<00:00:36.780> mouse<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
grenade and hold mouse to then you can

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
grenade and hold mouse to then you can
hold<00:00:38.969> down<00:00:39.120> Mouse<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.350> let<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
hold down Mouse one and then let go of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.110 
hold down Mouse one and then let go of
Mouse<00:00:40.980> two<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.489> gonna<00:00:41.670> give<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
Mouse two and that's gonna give you the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.010 
Mouse two and that's gonna give you the
mass<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.480> throw

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
mass one throw

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.610 
mass one throw
why<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> using<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> grenade<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:49.200> can

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
why are you so using a grenade you can

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
why are you so using a grenade you can
actually<00:00:49.739> mask<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.430> sound<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:50.879> defuse

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
actually mask the sound of your defuse

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
actually mask the sound of your defuse
so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:52.020> probably<00:00:52.440> easiest<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so it's probably easiest with a with a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.170 
so it's probably easiest with a with a
smoke<00:00:54.079> because<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> long<00:00:56.550> period<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
smoke because you have a long period of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
smoke because you have a long period of
hissing<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> first<00:00:58.079> pop<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> smoke<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
hissing when you first pop the smoke and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.049 
hissing when you first pop the smoke and
it<00:00:58.920> doesn't<00:00:59.219> need<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.460> anywhere<00:00:59.850> specific

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it doesn't need to be anywhere specific

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
it doesn't need to be anywhere specific
you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.600> pretty<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> anywhere<00:01:01.910> just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you can pretty much put it anywhere just

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.469 
you can pretty much put it anywhere just
wait<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> pop<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> they're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.330> gonna

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
wait for it to pop and they're not gonna

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.000 
wait for it to pop and they're not gonna
hear<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> smoke<00:01:07.650> popping

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
hear that because of the smoke popping

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.289 
hear that because of the smoke popping
but<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> flash<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but you can also do with the flash this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
but you can also do with the flash this
generally<00:01:09.689> works<00:01:09.840> best<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.470> you're<00:01:10.619> able<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
generally works best when you're able to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
generally works best when you're able to
land<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.280> flash<00:01:11.460> near<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> enemy<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.840> say

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
land a flash near the enemy to say

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.480 
land a flash near the enemy to say
there's<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.290> enemy<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.979> main<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
there's an enemy in main around the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.630 
there's an enemy in main around the
corner<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.570> land<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.840> flash<00:01:16.640> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
corner there you could land a flash and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
corner there you could land a flash and
then<00:01:18.030> start<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:19.049> too

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then start I did that little bit too

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.359 
then start I did that little bit too
earlier<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.590> land<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> flash<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> there

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
earlier you can land the flash in there

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.200 
earlier you can land the flash in there
and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:22.320> diffusing<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.210> that's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and then start diffusing and that's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
and then start diffusing and that's
that's<00:01:24.810> gonna<00:01:24.990> partially<00:01:25.710> blind<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that's gonna partially blind them and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's gonna partially blind them and
make<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> they're<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.590> gonna<00:01:28.799> hear

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
make it so that they're not gonna hear

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.649 
make it so that they're not gonna hear
they're<00:01:29.640> gonna<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> ringing<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.540> their

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
they're gonna have the ringing in their

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.999 
they're gonna have the ringing in their
in<00:01:30.900> their<00:01:30.990> headphones<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.890> gonna

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
in their headphones so they're not gonna

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
in their headphones so they're not gonna
hear<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> defuse<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.299> said<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> find

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
hear you defuse but like I said I find

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
hear you defuse but like I said I find
it<00:01:34.229> definitely<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.040> easier<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> smoke

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it definitely a lot easier with a smoke

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
it definitely a lot easier with a smoke
because<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.329> doesn't<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:36.990> matter<00:01:37.229> where

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
because it doesn't really matter where

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.399 
because it doesn't really matter where
it<00:01:37.560> lands<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.140> doesn't<00:01:40.290> have

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it lands and and and you it doesn't have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
it lands and and and you it doesn't have
to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.710> line<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.890> sight<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> terrorists

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to be in line of sight of the terrorists

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.920 
to be in line of sight of the terrorists
and<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> closer<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> obviously<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and the closer it is obviously the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.149 
and the closer it is obviously the
louder<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> smoke<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.649> gonna<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
louder the smoke is gonna be and it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.660 
louder the smoke is gonna be and it's
gonna<00:01:44.280> muffle<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> defusing<00:01:45.180> even<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.619> but

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
gonna muffle the defusing even more but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.149 
gonna muffle the defusing even more but
it's<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.540> area<00:01:49.049> independent<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's pretty much area independent and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
it's pretty much area independent and
you<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> nice<00:01:51.090> loooong<00:01:51.420> hits<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you get a nice loooong hits so it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.080 
you get a nice loooong hits so it's
really<00:01:53.340> useful<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.820> masking<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.259> few<00:01:55.439> some

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
really useful for masking and a few some

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.359 
really useful for masking and a few some
so<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.420> defusing<00:01:57.930> there's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> couple

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so when you're defusing there's a couple

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.709 
so when you're defusing there's a couple
of<00:01:59.490> ways<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.969> make<00:02:00.180> noise<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> try

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
of ways that you can make noise to try

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.600 
of ways that you can make noise to try
and<00:02:00.990> throw<00:02:01.140> off<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> terrorists<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and throw off the terrorists so the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
and throw off the terrorists so the
first<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.409> slap

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
first of which is to you can slap

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 
first of which is to you can slap
defusing<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.880> drop<00:02:06.149> your<00:02:06.180> gun<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:07.200> can

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
defusing and then drop your gun you can

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.510 
defusing and then drop your gun you can
jump<00:02:07.469> your<00:02:07.590> pistol<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.069> can<00:02:08.220> jump<00:02:08.369> your

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
jump your pistol you can jump your

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040 
jump your pistol you can jump your
primary<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.720> gonna<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
primary and it's just gonna make a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.809 
primary and it's just gonna make a
little<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> noise<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.979> potentially

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
little bit of noise and potentially

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.890 
little bit of noise and potentially
throw<00:02:12.030> off<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> terrorist

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
throw off a terrorist

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.789 
throw off a terrorist
so<00:02:13.349> another<00:02:13.920> way<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.129> do<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:15.650> why<00:02:16.650> you're

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
so another way to do it is why you're

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.500 
so another way to do it is why you're
defusing<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.549> actually<00:02:17.640> scope<00:02:18.060> with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
defusing you can actually scope with

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
defusing you can actually scope with
your<00:02:18.629> gun<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.799> terrorists<00:02:23.159> can

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
your gun and this is the terrorists can

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.309 
your gun and this is the terrorists can
hear<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.580> scopes<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.930> might<00:02:25.110> think

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
hear these scopes so they might think

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.869 
hear these scopes so they might think
that<00:02:25.409> you're<00:02:25.769> you're<00:02:26.190> not<00:02:26.340> defusing<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
that you're you're not defusing and

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.520 
that you're you're not defusing and
another<00:02:27.090> one<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.360> sure<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.319> right<00:02:28.500> click

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
another one is sure you can right click

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.039 
another one is sure you can right click
with<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> Glock<00:02:29.129> or<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.790> anything<00:02:30.360> anything

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
with a Glock or or anything anything

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.539 
with a Glock or or anything anything
that<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.409> can<00:02:31.560> actually<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:32.010> click<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
that you can actually right click and

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.509 
that you can actually right click and
use<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:34.140> able<00:02:34.500> you're<00:02:34.799> able<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.370> while

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
use is able you're able to do it while

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.430 
use is able you're able to do it while
you're<00:02:35.670> defusing<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:39.659> another<00:02:39.989> thing<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.230> can

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
you're defusing so another thing you can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.259 
you're defusing so another thing you can
do<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.159> have<00:02:41.400> an<00:02:41.489> off<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.879> if

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
do and this is really have an off is if

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.360 
do and this is really have an off is if
you<00:02:42.569> start<00:02:42.900> diffusing<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.709> scope<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you start diffusing you can scope in and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
you start diffusing you can scope in and
watch<00:02:44.519> an<00:02:44.610> angle<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> hold<00:02:45.720> mouse<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.319> while

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
watch an angle and hold mouse one while

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.559 
watch an angle and hold mouse one while
you're<00:02:46.739> hugging<00:02:47.040> II<00:02:47.220> as<00:02:47.879> soon<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.269> let<00:02:48.450> go

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
you're hugging II as soon as you let go

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.900 
you're hugging II as soon as you let go
of<00:02:48.599> eat<00:02:48.959> you'll<00:02:49.709> fire<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> shot<00:02:50.430> straight<00:02:50.700> away

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
of eat you'll fire a shot straight away

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.650 
of eat you'll fire a shot straight away
like<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.670> actually<00:02:53.700> tap<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
like this so you can actually tap the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.930 
like this so you can actually tap the
bomb<00:02:54.840> without<00:02:55.140> stopping<00:02:55.769> by<00:02:56.010> jumping<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
bomb without stopping by jumping and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.160 
bomb without stopping by jumping and
crouching<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:57.720> hit<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.870> bomb<00:02:58.079> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
crouching just as you hit the bomb and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.839 
crouching just as you hit the bomb and
the<00:02:58.260> easiest<00:02:58.409> way<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.220> hold<00:02:59.670> II

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
the easiest way to do this is hold II

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.300 
the easiest way to do this is hold II
then<00:03:00.840> run<00:03:01.049> at<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> bomb<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.680> jump<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.190> Crouch

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
then run at the bomb and jump and Crouch

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.119 
then run at the bomb and jump and Crouch
just<00:03:02.760> before<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.209> next<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.980> it's

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
just before you get next to it and it's

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.349 
just before you get next to it and it's
going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> allow<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:05.790> quite<00:03:06.030> far<00:03:06.239> away

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
going to allow you to be quite far away

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.500 
going to allow you to be quite far away
from<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.780> bomb<00:03:07.849> when<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.970> terrorist<00:03:09.299> picks

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
from the bomb when the terrorist picks

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.210 
from the bomb when the terrorist picks
you<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:10.079> he's<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.709> think<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.069> you're

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
you because he's gonna think that you're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.770 
you because he's gonna think that you're
still<00:03:11.430> defusing<00:03:11.849> because<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.480> sound<00:03:12.690> of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
still defusing because the the sound of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.380 
still defusing because the the sound of
the<00:03:12.870> defuse<00:03:13.260> partially<00:03:14.010> masks<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:15.030> landing

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the defuse partially masks your landing

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.210 
the defuse partially masks your landing
footstep<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.840> well<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.620> he's<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.919> even<00:03:17.130> gonna

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
footstep as well so he's not even gonna
