boost<00:03:22.730> up<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.970> potential<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.570> your<00:03:23.720> siphoning

I<00:03:29.079> think<00:03:30.079> siphoning<00:03:30.500> will<00:03:30.620> be<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.829> least

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
I think siphoning will be the least

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.800 
I think siphoning will be the least
popular<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.609> skill<00:03:31.850> trees<00:03:32.120> while<00:03:32.660> it's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
popular of the skill trees while it's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.059 
popular of the skill trees while it's
still<00:03:32.959> interesting<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.739> bring<00:03:33.890> some

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
still interesting and bring some

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.559 
still interesting and bring some
different<00:03:34.370> options<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.970> knight<00:03:35.120> blade<00:03:35.359> I

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
different options to the knight blade I

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.059 
different options to the knight blade I
think<00:03:35.959> most<00:03:36.170> players<00:03:36.380> will<00:03:36.590> prefer<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:36.890> more

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
think most players will prefer a more

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.789 
think most players will prefer a more
classic<00:03:37.549> assassination<00:03:38.269> style<00:03:38.569> however<00:03:39.350> with
