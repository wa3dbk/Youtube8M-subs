take<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> look<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> needle<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.450> using

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
take a look at the needle we're using

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
take a look at the needle we're using
with<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.050> bead<00:00:46.829> spinner<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> see

with our bead spinner and you can see

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
with our bead spinner and you can see
it's<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> hook<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.050> end<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.500> the

end we're going to load the beads on and
the<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.289> end<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> long<00:00:53.370> shaft<00:00:53.820> for

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the other end this is a long shaft for

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
the other end this is a long shaft for
the<00:00:54.180> beads<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.570> climb<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.500> other<00:00:55.710> end<00:00:55.980> it

chosen in my life I can't thread those
tiny<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:05.010> things<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.090> can't<00:01:06.390> see

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
tiny little things because I can't see

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this and put it into a needle threader I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
this and put it into a needle threader I
carry<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.760> friends

they can't see as well as we used to I
take<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> thread<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.170> where

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
take and I put the thread down in where

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
take and I put the thread down in where
it<00:01:22.860> says<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> put<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> thread<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.630> simply

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it says to put the thread and I simply

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.649 
it says to put the thread and I simply
push<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.560> lever<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.580> push<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.150> lever<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
push this lever when I push this lever I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.080 
push this lever when I push this lever I
can<00:01:27.840> pull<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.520> see

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can pull this out you can probably see

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.950 
can pull this out you can probably see
that<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.970> partially<00:01:32.970> pushed<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.780> my

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
eye now all I have to do is finish
threading<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.520> needle<00:01:43.310> okay<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.880> we're

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
threading the needle okay now what we're

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.530 
threading the needle okay now what we're
going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:46.159> leave<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> attached<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.360> the

come down into your thread and then you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.750 
come down into your thread and then you
can<00:02:28.360> load<00:02:28.600> your<00:02:28.630> next<00:02:29.260> section<00:02:32.640> what's<00:02:33.640> up

fastest<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.480> if<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.780> were<00:02:34.900> doing<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.230> by

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
fastest is if you were doing this by

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
fastest is if you were doing this by
hand<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:37.060> could<00:02:37.239> still<00:02:37.480> do<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.900> course<00:02:38.200> but

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
hand you could still do it of course but

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.360 
hand you could still do it of course but
this<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.459> much<00:02:40.090> faster<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.770> we're

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
this is so much faster here we go we're

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.120 
this is so much faster here we go we're
getting<00:02:42.459> ready<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.290> climb<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.350> about<00:02:44.800> halfway

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
getting ready to climb up about halfway

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.580

and then we all once this was loaded
we'll<00:02:50.590> go<00:02:50.860> ahead<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.550> put<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.540> end<00:02:52.780> of

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
we'll go ahead and put it on the end of
