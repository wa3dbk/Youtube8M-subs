seconds<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.969> use<00:01:57.479> D<00:01:57.689> before<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.259> if

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
seconds if you use D before and if

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
seconds if you use D before and if
you're<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> battle<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.909> combo<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you're in a battle your combo now is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.740 
you're in a battle your combo now is
kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> ue<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.750> reposition

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
kind of going to be a ue to reposition

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.399 
kind of going to be a ue to reposition
or<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.110> need<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
or go in and then you don't need to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
or go in and then you don't need to
worry<00:02:07.619> about<00:02:07.770> using<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.310> escape<00:02:08.580> because

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
worry about using your escape because

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.609 
worry about using your escape because
it's<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.690> again<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it's going to be up again because you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
it's going to be up again because you
hit<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:10.950> passive<00:02:11.340> 44<00:02:11.730> seconds<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
hit your passive 44 seconds because it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.370 
hit your passive 44 seconds because it
doubles<00:02:12.750> then

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
doubles then

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
doubles then
York<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.800> or<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.220> W<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.910> then<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.420> four

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
York you or your W and then that's four

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.600 
York you or your W and then that's four
more<00:02:16.110> seconds<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.770> get<00:02:17.070> an<00:02:17.190> alt<00:02:17.400> off

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
more seconds and if you get an alt off

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.490 
more seconds and if you get an alt off
and<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.300> cancel<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.780> gets<00:02:19.140> cancelled

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and then like cancel it gets cancelled

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.720 
and then like cancel it gets cancelled
that's<00:02:19.860> another<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.250> second<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> can

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that's another for second so you can

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.280 
that's another for second so you can
basically<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.390> zero<00:02:21.720> second<00:02:22.110> cooldown

seconds<00:03:50.280> trying<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.870> get<00:03:52.080> away<00:03:52.170> from<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.590> luck

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
seconds trying to get away from the luck

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.650 
seconds trying to get away from the luck
salt<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.640> realized<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.030> Lux<00:03:54.480> was

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
salt and then I realized that Lux was

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.890 
salt and then I realized that Lux was
actually<00:03:55.230> on<00:03:55.410> my<00:03:55.440> team<00:03:56.240> but<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.510> still<00:03:57.720> look

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
actually on my team but it still look

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.899 
actually on my team but it still look
cool<00:03:58.080> n<00:03:58.230> 340

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.860 

anyway<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.120> clip<00:04:04.269> I'm<00:04:04.390> getting<00:04:04.629> jumped

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
anyway in this clip I'm getting jumped

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.360 
anyway in this clip I'm getting jumped
by<00:04:04.900> hecarim<00:04:05.379> so<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.739> dash<00:04:05.920> away<00:04:06.099> right

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
by hecarim so I just dash away right

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.610 
by hecarim so I just dash away right
away<00:04:06.400> but<00:04:07.060> then<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.299> mark<00:04:07.629> him<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.049> since<00:04:08.500> it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
away but then I mark him and since it

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.089 
away but then I mark him and since it
reduces<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:10.599> cooldown<00:04:10.750> my<00:04:11.349> dash<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.709> up<00:04:11.799> again

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
reduces the cooldown my dash is up again

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.780 
reduces the cooldown my dash is up again
so<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> get<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.329> I<00:04:13.500> hit<00:04:14.500> him<00:04:14.530> face<00:04:15.159> with<00:04:15.610> my

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790

alt and he just comes in too far and I
kill<00:04:19.120> him<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.419> my<00:04:20.320> Dash<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.590> up<00:04:21.100> again<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
kill him and my Dash is up again so I

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.090 
kill him and my Dash is up again so I
dash<00:04:22.479> away<00:04:22.660> from<00:04:22.900> there<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.380> Lulu<00:04:23.650> continues

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
to give chase so she marks me but I

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.290

flush<00:04:27.130> glitter<00:04:27.400> lanes<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:27.880> get<00:04:28.060> into<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
flush glitter lanes and get into the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.060 
flush glitter lanes and get into the
brush<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.289> saunders<00:04:29.560> coming<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.860> save<00:04:30.039> me

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
brush and the saunders coming to save me

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.340

but<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:30.940> turn<00:04:31.240> around<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.780> do<00:04:31.870> just<00:04:32.199> enough

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
but I turn around and do just enough

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.560 
but I turn around and do just enough
auto<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:33.009> I<00:04:33.039> can<00:04:33.220> dash<00:04:33.370> again<00:04:33.759> and<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.180> should

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
auto so I can dash again and I should

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.689 
auto so I can dash again and I should
have<00:04:34.720> survived<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.710> went<00:04:36.190> back<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.550> and

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
I am doing well and I opted to go for

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.350 
I am doing well and I opted to go for
more<00:05:18.039> of<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.220> caster<00:05:18.669> bill<00:05:18.849> just<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.180> test

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
more of a caster bill just to test

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.330 
more of a caster bill just to test
things<00:05:19.539> out<00:05:19.750> where<00:05:20.229> bleh<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.620> room<00:05:20.800> king<00:05:21.010> you

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
things out where bleh the room king you

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.540 
things out where bleh the room king you
lose<00:05:21.580> last<00:05:22.090> whisper<00:05:22.360> into<00:05:23.110> trinity<00:05:23.979> force<00:05:24.250> and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
lose last whisper into trinity force and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.640 
lose last whisper into trinity force and
there<00:05:25.270> wasn't<00:05:25.419> any<00:05:25.690> infinity<00:05:26.199> idea<00:05:26.500> or<00:05:26.590> a

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
there wasn't any infinity idea or a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.200 
there wasn't any infinity idea or a
bunch<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.889> attack<00:05:27.159> speed<00:05:27.400> in<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.639> and<00:05:27.789> this

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
bunch of attack speed in it and this

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.120 
bunch of attack speed in it and this
worked<00:05:28.599> really<00:05:28.930> well<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.560> think<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:30.070> is

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
worked really well I think this is

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.740 
worked really well I think this is
definitely<00:05:30.430> going<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:30.909> be<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.270> better<00:05:31.419> build

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
definitely going to be the better build

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.529 
definitely going to be the better build
for<00:05:32.139> Lucien<00:05:32.440> this<00:05:32.590> patch<00:05:33.090> more<00:05:34.090> more<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.479> a

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
for Lucien this patch more more of a

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.790 
for Lucien this patch more more of a
casual<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.289> in<00:05:36.810> soloqueue<00:05:37.810> no<00:05:38.050> professionals

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
casual and in soloqueue no professionals

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.960 
casual and in soloqueue no professionals
might<00:05:38.949> have<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.130> different<00:05:39.280> opinion<00:05:39.550> I'm<00:05:39.820> no

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
might have a different opinion I'm no

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.779 
might have a different opinion I'm no
god<00:05:40.210> but<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.750> did<00:05:41.710> really<00:05:41.949> I<00:05:42.220> think<00:05:42.580> it's<00:05:42.729> very

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
god but I did really I think it's very

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.000 
god but I did really I think it's very
effective<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.720> in<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.110> second<00:05:44.560> game<00:05:44.740> where

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
effective and in that second game where

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.450 
effective and in that second game where
you<00:05:45.130> saw<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.400> was<00:05:45.729> facing<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.300> top<00:05:47.169> lane<00:05:47.349> Lulu<00:05:47.710> we

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
you saw I was facing a top lane Lulu we

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.719 
you saw I was facing a top lane Lulu we
had<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:48.669> fiora<00:05:49.150> that<00:05:49.570> went<00:05:49.750> AFK<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.620> i<00:05:51.520> had<00:05:51.639> to

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
had a fiora that went AFK and i had to

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.279 
had a fiora that went AFK and i had to
go<00:05:51.849> top<00:05:52.120> so<00:05:52.389> i<00:05:52.419> just<00:05:52.599> decided<00:05:52.720> I'll<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:53.260> know

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
go top so i just decided I'll you know

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.339 
go top so i just decided I'll you know
might<00:05:53.740> as<00:05:53.770> well<00:05:53.889> go<00:05:54.099> top<00:05:54.810> test<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.960> out<00:05:56.050> Lucia

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
might as well go top test it out Lucia

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.689 
might as well go top test it out Lucia
might<00:05:56.560> be<00:05:56.650> good<00:05:56.770> top<00:05:57.010> now<00:05:57.159> since<00:05:57.430> he's<00:05:57.550> lower

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
might be good top now since he's lower

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.020 
might be good top now since he's lower
range<00:05:58.000> and<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:59.260> ignore<00:05:59.860> me<00:06:00.070> being<00:06:00.460> retarded<00:06:00.760> in

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
range and it ignore me being retarded in

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.409 
range and it ignore me being retarded in
this<00:06:01.150> clip<00:06:01.330> but<00:06:01.840> uh<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:03.580> did<00:06:03.970> think<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.270> would

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
this clip but uh I I did think it would

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.589 
this clip but uh I I did think it would
be<00:06:04.539> good<00:06:04.720> so<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:06.120> tried<00:06:07.120> to<00:06:07.300> go<00:06:07.389> for<00:06:07.570> the

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
be good so I tried to go for the

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.149 
be good so I tried to go for the
different<00:06:07.990> build<00:06:08.139> which<00:06:08.349> was<00:06:08.500> infinity<00:06:09.039> edge

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
different build which was infinity edge

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.370 
different build which was infinity edge
into<00:06:09.639> static<00:06:09.940> ship<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.870> did<00:06:11.050> not<00:06:11.169> like<00:06:11.349> it

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
into static ship and I did not like it

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.500 
into static ship and I did not like it
at<00:06:11.710> all<00:06:11.770> I<00:06:12.219> thought<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.820> power<00:06:13.000> spike<00:06:13.330> was

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
at all I thought the power spike was

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.510 
at all I thought the power spike was
much<00:06:13.750> later<00:06:14.020> and<00:06:14.349> it<00:06:14.950> was<00:06:15.130> much<00:06:15.340> more

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
much later and it was much more

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.230 
much later and it was much more
expensive

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
expensive

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.610 
expensive
for<00:06:16.509> a<00:06:16.539> top<00:06:16.780> lane<00:06:17.020> build<00:06:17.259> where<00:06:17.410> you're<00:06:17.530> not

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
for a top lane build where you're not

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.870 
for a top lane build where you're not
going<00:06:17.800> to<00:06:17.860> be<00:06:17.949> getting<00:06:18.190> much<00:06:18.340> kills<00:06:18.639> or

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
going to be getting much kills or

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.490 
going to be getting much kills or
assists<00:06:19.240> as<00:06:19.479> you<00:06:19.690> would<00:06:19.870> be<00:06:19.990> an<00:06:20.080> ad<00:06:20.259> carry

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
assists as you would be an ad carry

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.219 
assists as you would be an ad carry
build<00:06:20.880> I'm<00:06:21.880> just<00:06:22.180> going<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.419> sick<00:06:22.660> you<00:06:22.900> can<00:06:23.050> try

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
build I'm just going to sick you can try

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.850 
build I'm just going to sick you can try
things<00:06:23.470> out<00:06:23.620> for<00:06:24.419> yourself<00:06:25.419> but<00:06:26.259> I<00:06:26.410> really

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
things out for yourself but I really

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.379 
things out for yourself but I really
think<00:06:27.039> bleh<00:06:27.280> the<00:06:27.400> room<00:06:27.580> can<00:06:27.699> do<00:06:27.940> moves<00:06:28.240> is

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
think bleh the room can do moves is

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.120 
think bleh the room can do moves is
definitely<00:06:28.810> better<00:06:28.930> especially<00:06:29.650> with<00:06:30.009> the

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
definitely better especially with the

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.309 
definitely better especially with the
caster<00:06:30.580> build<00:06:30.789> it<00:06:31.090> allows<00:06:31.509> mall<00:06:31.810> so<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.020> pros

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
caster build it allows mall so the pros

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.990 
caster build it allows mall so the pros
of<00:06:32.349> the<00:06:32.560> new<00:06:32.680> Lucien<00:06:33.009> are<00:06:33.099> that<00:06:33.310> it's<00:06:33.669> more

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
of the new Lucien are that it's more

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.689 
of the new Lucien are that it's more
mobile<00:06:34.419> there<00:06:34.990> are<00:06:35.169> more<00:06:35.410> build<00:06:35.650> paths<00:06:35.919> more

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
mobile there are more build paths more

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.120 
mobile there are more build paths more
options<00:06:37.240> like<00:06:37.509> top<00:06:37.780> or<00:06:37.990> ad<00:06:38.110> carry<00:06:38.349> and<00:06:38.889> you're

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
options like top or ad carry and you're

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.710 
options like top or ad carry and you're
less<00:06:39.310> likely<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.639> go<00:06:39.819> home<00:06:40.000> especially<00:06:40.360> in<00:06:40.630> the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
less likely to go home especially in the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.290 
less likely to go home especially in the
Midland<00:06:41.080> early<00:06:41.770> game<00:06:41.919> sorry<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.460> it's<00:06:43.150> just

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
Midland early game sorry and it's just

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.990 
Midland early game sorry and it's just
more<00:06:43.780> fun<00:06:44.050> in<00:06:44.259> my<00:06:44.410> opinion<00:06:44.650> anyway<00:06:45.039> so<00:06:45.759> the

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
more fun in my opinion anyway so the

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.969 
more fun in my opinion anyway so the
cons<00:06:46.300> of<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.810> new<00:06:46.960> Lucien<00:06:47.380> are<00:06:47.560> that<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.949> are

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
cons of the new Lucien are that you are

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.909 
cons of the new Lucien are that you are
destroyed<00:06:48.789> by<00:06:49.060> long-range<00:06:49.330> you<00:06:50.110> feel<00:06:50.380> really

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
destroyed by long-range you feel really

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.610 
destroyed by long-range you feel really
clunky<00:06:51.250> to<00:06:51.580> play<00:06:51.789> at<00:06:51.909> first<00:06:52.259> you'll<00:06:53.259> know<00:06:53.440> if

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
clunky to play at first you'll know if

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.960 
clunky to play at first you'll know if
you<00:06:53.740> play<00:06:53.949> them<00:06:54.009> it<00:06:54.190> you'll<00:06:54.340> just<00:06:54.400> not<00:06:54.789> be

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
you play them it you'll just not be
