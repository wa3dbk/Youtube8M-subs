00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.580
 moin together today I want you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.519
 introduce my side and that is the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.719
 Lesson of all power spins and farmers 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 I think you already know her 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.560
 is also completely out of many professionals 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 played right now but she gives in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 tested the spin variant we have the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.890
 of course on these two bats 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560
 the new pop stars of the '97s from federer 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 and the normal 790 and in short who 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 Salmon and knows that the very 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 very and high quality sites like 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.059
 said quite rightly played by the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 professionals on the tour with his 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.899
 most played sites now here with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 mass is and there is not only on it 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.390
 quite rightly on the omme what the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.219
 swing plate the normal alu bauer knows 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.719
 one and that is usually for it 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.370
 that actually lasts quite a long time 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 the very good the tension itself 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.910
 think that is a great feeling and that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.739
 a lot of power comes out for it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.629
 the only with one of the fastest 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 At least I know those now 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 stop the spin on top and the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.969
 is really important to me very well 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 it's not just in the frame 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.049
 but it's like I said even as 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 is just a completely different page 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.119
 but with the same feeling but after 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.920
 completely different players took the first 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.479
 maybe ten fifteen minutes is the page 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 still a little bit hard when 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 play that is very fast 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 and then it stays like that for a very long time 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.409
 you would like her to be my name 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 My part is very small at the beginning 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 maybe a bit harder ready 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 kilo one and a half on afterwards the thing 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.350
 bit soft play after he has 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 very long full 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.619
 at least if someone says like me 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.210
 which almost never tear sides 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.400
 look at the other versions as well 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 from the lax sides in our shop times 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.939
 as I said who is on alu power 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.770
 is right here but there are all 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.229
 well behaved now, however, the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.060
 game version who is on spin who one 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.649
 would like to have a good side would be a bit 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.850
 speed and just wants one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.950
 wants to have excellent side 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.909
 please access here that was the salmon 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.909
 powers
