00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
so I just like Marcin previously I think

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.639 
so I just like Marcin previously I think
it's<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> quite<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> standard

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it's gonna be quite the standard

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
it's gonna be quite the standard
variation<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.909> riders<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.359> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
variation that you see the riders do it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.029 
variation that you see the riders do it
especially<00:01:57.539> in<00:01:58.079> run<00:01:58.229> number<00:01:58.499> one<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> want

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
especially in run number one as I want
