you<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.440> see<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.890> makes<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.160> huge<00:03:13.640> difference

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you can see that makes a huge difference

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.870 
you can see that makes a huge difference
now<00:03:14.840> I'm<00:03:15.080> already<00:03:15.440> wearing<00:03:16.070> false<00:03:16.400> eyelashes

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
now I'm already wearing false eyelashes

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.180 
now I'm already wearing false eyelashes
right<00:03:17.030> now<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.080> harder<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.560> get<00:03:18.800> all<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
right now so it is harder to get all the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.590 
right now so it is harder to get all the
way<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.280> into<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.610> crease<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.210> you're<00:03:20.390> doing

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
way up into the crease if you're doing

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.720 
way up into the crease if you're doing
this<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.960> recommend<00:03:21.110> doing<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.740> before<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.550> put

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
this I recommend doing it before you put

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.880 
this I recommend doing it before you put
your<00:03:22.820> false<00:03:23.060> eyelashes<00:03:23.570> on<00:03:23.720> my<00:03:24.380> dog<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.800> came

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
your false eyelashes on my dog just came

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.390 
your false eyelashes on my dog just came

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.430 

yeah<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.060> recommend<00:03:29.629> definitely<00:03:29.810> doing<00:03:30.319> this

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
yeah I recommend definitely doing this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.050 
yeah I recommend definitely doing this
before<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.830> put<00:03:30.920> your<00:03:31.159> false<00:03:31.370> eyelashes<00:03:31.909> on

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
before you put your false eyelashes on

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.720 
before you put your false eyelashes on

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
and this is actually very important for

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.039 
and this is actually very important for
when<00:03:34.909> you're<00:03:35.030> wearing<00:03:35.180> false<00:03:35.420> eyelashes<00:03:35.930> as
