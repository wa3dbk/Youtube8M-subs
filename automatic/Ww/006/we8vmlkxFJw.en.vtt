00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
bulge it is a minor one you can only see

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.849 
bulge it is a minor one you can only see
it<00:03:35.970> from<00:03:36.000> certain<00:03:36.419> angles<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> baby<00:03:37.590> bump

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
it from certain angles but the baby bump

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.979 
it from certain angles but the baby bump
is<00:03:37.980> definitely<00:03:38.430> there<00:03:38.639> if<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.480> can't<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.900> it

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
is definitely there if you can't see it

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.099 
is definitely there if you can't see it
well<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.859> tabletop<00:03:41.430> can<00:03:41.669> feel<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.389> you

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
well the tabletop can feel it if you

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.690 
well the tabletop can feel it if you
have<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.260> phone<00:03:43.530> case<00:03:43.739> with<00:03:43.980> tight<00:03:44.190> tolerances

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
have a phone case with tight tolerances

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.059 
have a phone case with tight tolerances
it<00:03:45.299> definitely<00:03:45.870> won't<00:03:46.049> like<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.530> very<00:03:46.769> much

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
it definitely won't like this very much

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.930 
it definitely won't like this very much
at<00:03:47.340> all<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.810> does<00:03:49.169> it<00:03:49.319> work<00:03:50.150> yeah<00:03:51.950> sorta<00:03:52.950> at

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
at all so does it work yeah sorta at

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.309 
at all so does it work yeah sorta at
first<00:03:54.239> putting<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.810> note<00:03:54.930> floor<00:03:55.139> directly

onto the plate doesn't elicit a response
which<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.440> probably<00:03:58.739> why<00:03:59.160> tilt<00:03:59.489> included<00:03:59.910> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
which is probably why tilt included a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.690 
which is probably why tilt included a

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
different orientations I quickly find

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.140 
different orientations I quickly find
that<00:04:05.010> I'm<00:04:05.099> lucky<00:04:05.430> or<00:04:05.519> with<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.730> green<00:04:05.910> light

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
that I'm lucky or with the green light

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.909 
that I'm lucky or with the green light
if<00:04:06.329> I<00:04:06.389> place<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.750> note<00:04:06.870> sideways<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.709> pad

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
if I place the note sideways on the pad

light at first I wasn't actually
charging<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:16.049> had<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> go<00:04:16.890> back<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.400> reseat

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
charging I had to go back in and reseat

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.029 
charging I had to go back in and reseat
the<00:04:17.940> pins<00:04:18.359> pressing<00:04:19.169> hard<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:19.590> making<00:04:19.799> sure

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
the pins pressing hard and making sure

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.610 
the pins pressing hard and making sure
everything<00:04:20.609> lined<00:04:20.849> up<00:04:20.969> perfectly<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.840> even

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
everything lined up perfectly and even

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.649 
everything lined up perfectly and even
then<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.010> got<00:04:23.400> no<00:04:23.669> charging<00:04:24.150> love<00:04:24.330> from<00:04:24.570> the

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
firm zap of juice and then finally it

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.450 
firm zap of juice and then finally it
worked<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.419> solo<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.890> view<00:04:35.099> mate<00:04:35.250> did

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
throw our NFC reception for a loop it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.350 
throw our NFC reception for a loop it
didn't<00:04:38.159> completely<00:04:38.280> disable<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
package warned it might but it did

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.040 
package warned it might but it did
possibly<00:04:41.490> affect<00:04:41.820> its<00:04:41.969> reception<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.659> speed

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
possibly affect its reception and speed

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.870 
possibly affect its reception and speed
as<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.800> took<00:04:43.919> me<00:04:43.979> several<00:04:44.310> tries<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.729> get<00:04:44.849> a
