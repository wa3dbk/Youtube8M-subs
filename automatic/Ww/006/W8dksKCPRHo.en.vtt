00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.910 
group renew vitamin based hair
restoration<00:00:09.469> lotion<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.690> it's<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.380> hair

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
restoration lotion and it's just a hair

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
restoration lotion and it's just a hair
lotion<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.490> mean<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.179> more<00:00:15.389> creamy<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:17.510> light

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
lotion I mean it's more creamy and light

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.210 
lotion I mean it's more creamy and light
I<00:00:18.570> guess<00:00:18.900> then<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> regular<00:00:19.619> hair<00:00:19.830> lotion<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
I guess then a regular hair lotion is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.640 
I guess then a regular hair lotion is
not<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> stick<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.539> does<00:00:21.720> help<00:00:22.020> smooth<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
not a stick and it does help smooth the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
not a stick and it does help smooth the
edges<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> said<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.210> don't<00:00:24.269> know

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
edges like you said like I don't know

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.970 
edges like you said like I don't know
why<00:00:24.600> their<00:00:24.779> stuff<00:00:25.109> does<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> does

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
why their stuff does that but it does

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
why their stuff does that but it does
and<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.670> has<00:00:26.880> been<00:00:27.119> helpful<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.599> break<00:00:27.810> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and it has been helpful with my break in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
and it has been helpful with my break in
your<00:00:28.109> life<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.619> believe<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.519> working

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
your life so I do believe it's working

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
your life so I do believe it's working
I'm<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.599> sure<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.960> length<00:00:31.260> because<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I'm not sure about a length because this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
I'm not sure about a length because this
is<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.340> length<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> restoration<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:35.360> I'm

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
is for length the restoration and I'm

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
is for length the restoration and I'm
not<00:00:36.600> sure<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.590> doing<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
not sure if it's really doing all of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.560 
not sure if it's really doing all of
that<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.700> helping<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.030> breaky<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that but it is helping my breaky so I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.520 
that but it is helping my breaky so I
guess<00:00:42.780> less<00:00:43.440> breakage<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.430> headroom<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.530> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
guess less breakage more headroom and I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
guess less breakage more headroom and I
mean<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.789> guess<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> say

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
mean I guess that's all I have to say

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
mean I guess that's all I have to say
about<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.500> usually<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.700> my

because people who have natural moisture

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
because people who have natural moisture
in<00:01:51.570> air<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.869> their<00:01:52.350> hair<00:01:52.560> already<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.520> will

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
in air and their hair already this will

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
in air and their hair already this will
provide<00:01:54.119> too<00:01:54.329> much<00:01:54.360> moisture<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.079> your

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
provide too much moisture and make your

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
provide too much moisture and make your
hair<00:01:55.380> greasy<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.329> friend

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
hair greasy because I had it my friend

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
hair greasy because I had it my friend
tried<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.320> she<00:01:58.500> has<00:01:58.680> natural<00:01:59.100> moisture

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
tried to use it she has natural moisture

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
tried to use it she has natural moisture
in<00:01:59.520> her<00:01:59.610> hair<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.110> she<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.439> upset

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
in her hair and she was really upset

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.819 
in her hair and she was really upset
outcome<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> only<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.409> damaged

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
outcome so only if it has really damaged

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.920 
outcome so only if it has really damaged
and<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.610> moisture<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.360> may<00:02:06.810> not

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
and it doesn't have moisture I may not

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
and it doesn't have moisture I may not
