after a couple hours work
I<00:00:05.000> met<00:00:06.000> where<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> should<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.660> been<00:00:06.779> about<00:00:07.230> an

hour and a half ago I was trying to get
this<00:00:10.800> tie<00:00:11.700> right<00:00:11.910> apart<00:00:12.269> with<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> screwdriver

this tie right apart with a screwdriver

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
this tie right apart with a screwdriver
because<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.799> didn't<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> pickle<00:00:14.429> fork<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
because I didn't have a pickle fork and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.120 
because I didn't have a pickle fork and
I<00:00:15.089> finally<00:00:15.450> broke<00:00:16.320> down<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> went<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130

bought a pickle fork so it was off in
about<00:00:20.310> two<00:00:20.520> minutes<00:00:20.640> after<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.510> the

another case of it pays to have the

another case of it pays to have the
right<00:00:25.890> tools<00:00:26.570> wasted<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.109> hours<00:00:28.470> trying

right tools wasted for two hours trying

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
to get that apart I have this driveshaft

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.650 
to get that apart I have this driveshaft
off<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.739> strut<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.550> completely<00:00:36.180> loose<00:00:36.390> from

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
off this strut is completely loose from

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.410 
off this strut is completely loose from
the<00:00:36.809> control<00:00:37.170> arm<00:00:37.610> you<00:00:38.610> don't<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> take

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the control arm you don't have to take

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.510 
the control arm you don't have to take
it<00:00:39.450> totally<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it totally out you just have to get it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
it totally out you just have to get it
to<00:00:41.640> where<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:43.200> driveshaft<00:00:43.590> out

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to where you can get the driveshaft out

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.650 
to where you can get the driveshaft out
of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> transmission<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> move

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
of the way so the transmission can move

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
of the way so the transmission can move
because<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
because you don't have to take the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.690 
because you don't have to take the
transmission<00:00:47.789> completely<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> car<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
transmission completely out of the car I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.580 
transmission completely out of the car I
have<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.910> mount<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.899> nuts<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:54.590> I'm

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
have this mount the nuts off of it I'm

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.689 
have this mount the nuts off of it I'm
going<00:00:55.920> around<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.399> side<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.050> I've<00:00:58.920> taken

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going around on this side and I've taken

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
going around on this side and I've taken
almost<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.190> driveshaft<00:01:02.190> bolts<00:01:02.789> out

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
almost all the driveshaft bolts out

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.929 
almost all the driveshaft bolts out
except<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.500> left<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.220> as

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
except for the one that's left here as

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.230 
except for the one that's left here as
you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.680> nuts<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> inside<00:01:08.640> then

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you can see the nuts on the inside then

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.800 
you can see the nuts on the inside then
alpha<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.930> nice<00:01:10.170> enough<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.240> let<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.270> sit<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
alpha was nice enough to let it sit in a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
alpha was nice enough to let it sit in a
spot<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> put<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
spot where you don't have to put a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
spot where you don't have to put a
wrench<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> few<00:01:17.310> minutes<00:01:17.810> I'll<00:01:18.810> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
wrench on it so in a few minutes I'll be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.210 
wrench on it so in a few minutes I'll be
going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> tackle<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> starter<00:01:22.009> actually<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
going to tackle the starter actually the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
going to tackle the starter actually the
intermediate<00:01:23.880> shaft<00:01:23.909> between<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.659> gearbox

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
intermediate shaft between the gearbox

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560 
intermediate shaft between the gearbox
and<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.130> drive<00:01:26.369> shaft<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:26.880> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> see

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and the drive shaft you can kind of see

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.870 
and the drive shaft you can kind of see
the<00:01:28.380> flange<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the flange of it right there in the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.990 
the flange of it right there in the
center<00:01:30.090> bolts<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> transmission<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
center bolts of the transmission that

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.190 
center bolts of the transmission that
intermediate<00:01:33.000> shaft<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> come<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:33.900> as

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
intermediate shaft has to come out as

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.600 
intermediate shaft has to come out as
well

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.610 

friend<00:01:37.480> of<00:01:37.600> mine<00:01:37.690> says<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.110> can<00:01:38.230> do<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.500> with

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
friend of mine says you can do it with

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.470 
friend of mine says you can do it with
it<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.860> he's<00:01:39.100> done<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.460> both<00:01:39.610> ways<00:01:39.880> but<00:01:40.180> he<00:01:40.270> says

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
it in he's done it both ways but he says

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.970 
it in he's done it both ways but he says
it's<00:01:40.660> easier<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.290> spend<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> extra<00:01:41.740> time

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
it's easier just to spend the extra time

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's easier just to spend the extra time
and<00:01:42.460> take<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.420> out<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:43.840> that's<00:01:44.020> what<00:01:44.230> I'm<00:01:44.320> gonna

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and take it out so that's what I'm gonna

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.570 
and take it out so that's what I'm gonna
do<00:01:44.680> because<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:47.050> time's<00:01:47.290> worth<00:01:48.040> some<00:01:48.430> my

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
do because a little time's worth some my

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.520 
do because a little time's worth some my
easiness<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:51.720> once<00:01:52.720> they<00:01:52.900> get<00:01:53.020> everything<00:01:53.260> out

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
easiness so once they get everything out

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530 
easiness so once they get everything out
I<00:01:53.800> should<00:01:54.190> be<00:01:54.580> starting<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.030> separate<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
I should be starting to separate the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.880 
I should be starting to separate the
gearbox<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:57.600> I'll<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.840> footage<00:01:59.260> of<00:01:59.500> that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
gearbox and I'll have footage of that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.540 
gearbox and I'll have footage of that
Coria<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.880> part<00:02:01.240> three
