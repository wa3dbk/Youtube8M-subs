00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 this I was guided because when 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 It starts going super bad but good the case 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.010

 It is true that it is still a bit but 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.680
 nothing really 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.730
 to really see the mind 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.579
 1010 and I think this is the penultimate 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:19.069
 layer is not the third-last so 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.140

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.489

 around here that's for the best 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.530
 we were 9 and I could do everything right I did not 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.780
 I know you but I really see myself 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.060
 quite pretty sure of myself and 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.549
 my movements so there is no reason 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.700

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.080
 kind of problem that when you remove the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
