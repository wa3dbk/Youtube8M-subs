00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 nice guys that oil we 're in today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 new video on gta 5 which then by the way 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 see cases in this period the videos 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 to refer to symbols such as 833 in this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.500
 type case after eating me put 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.859
 dislocate from panic on gta 5 and then 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 you want to make videos then with 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.140
 you see we are in the bay bay to the north 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 of the map pending the same city 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.570
 now I make you a spoiler one where you are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 robbery of the kes bank here in this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
 exact exact point where you are 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 this pea that emerges from the road 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.920
 unexpressed here this landfill can 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.719
 find a weapon I know I was the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 first in Italy to find out why I have 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 searched abroad were already done yes 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 called chrome bari crowbar if not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.129
 but you knew in Italy I could not find 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.750
 Italian videos so they probably are 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.949
 precisely the first is as you see given 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 that I had some difficulty a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 find it from the tutorials because the depart 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.629
 already with the ass attached to the network icons 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 we are here says the giant chicken no vi 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 I show god christ ok I look for them 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 logic i 'm fallin shit in the middle and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 basically go to the left 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.799
 there is this landfill purchase of the chicken 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.150
 then look at the buy front setting 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.830
 and well we go to this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 just don't have it because they are all 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.960
 there are the same pellets and now these 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.409
 so and the bin not here in the recess e 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.630
 there is the total vent crowbar that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.670
 does not even tell you me or cazz or to do 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.729
 a film is absurd the first time it is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 I take ok so three is not maximum three 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.060
 ropes three weapons and that christ that is alone 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.970
 the maximum four weapons because they are 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.210
 various unique hidden weapons we say type 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.440
 the king of animation said by the team yes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.580
 he said like 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.620
 the baseball bat we risk it 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.780
 cazzola golf club 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.700
 in short, various distros you see we send a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.630
 test it anyway you have understood 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.870
 that is, where it takes no limited edition 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.119
 collector's edition that is present is one 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.730
 absurd stuff because so many say it is 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.190
 a tribute to the video game series 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.800
 half life ie in particular at half 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.570
 life 2 where present gordon freeman has 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.410
 had this trinket that we say that 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.510
 made him famous 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.340
 but if I don't find anyone now, I will 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.300
 Incazzo is beautiful fence 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.300
 the serious pack is what the fuck for 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
 this is inevitable as a type of the rest 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.910
 the white lady was the one who is 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.340
 the girl disappeared instead of what the fuck you do 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.260
 but you are looking for a bastard view 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.270
 then it comes down here we see a little 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.500
 first time of the text is that it says a lot 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.209
 funny anyway and total vent here yes 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.310
 league there is one shot Enimont shop 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.220
 in short, if you liked the limit he writes 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.210
 the channel put a like while a big 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.570
 like a holly e 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.300
