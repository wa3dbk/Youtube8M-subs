00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.720
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.509
 I want to go bag com point 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.629
 hello welcome to the board in this video 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 class we are going to talk about eugra phylum 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:22.020
 9 30 usw lennoy says are unicellular 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.740
 or are unicellular algae free 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.240
 natanz for swimming they have two 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.449
 scourge a scourge that emerges from the cell 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.480
 and this scourge responsible for 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.239
 cell locomotion and a flagellum that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 stays here and does not leave the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.499
 cell 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 the majority of your goal is that it's water 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.690
 sweet and this class I will illustrate and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.079
 night so you know a little 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 of the cellular structure of this algae 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.510
 because in several tests this illustration 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.269
 it's present so it's good you 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.649
 watch closely with us already 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.590
 we know algae are eukaryotic cells 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:11.009
 so we have here the presence of the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 cell nucleus is not here 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.909
 the core and inside the nucleus that we 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.289
 we even have the genetic material beyond 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.920
 cell nucleus 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:26.070
 the algae I won nord also presents 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.189
 a structure that is called the cello and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.030
 then the very interesting function this 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 structure is ehec pepper capable of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.829
 perceive the brightness of the environment or 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.289
 whether the ocelus is perceived the presence or 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.140
 not an environment and this is very 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.399
 important mainly for algae 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.679
 which are photosynthetic because 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.829
 through the perception of the cello 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.920
 classes will move to spaces of the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.720
 medium in which there is more light 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.440
 light that will be important to react 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.649
 the action of photosynthesis and only a few are 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.320
 important for good photosynthesis to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.320
 photosynthesis you already know that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.580
 a pigment is required which is the pigment 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.810
 it's that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.570
 chlorophyll and being the cell of its 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.600
 great hero sum cell eukaryotes 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.590
 this chlorophyll is contained in a 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.900
 structure that we know as 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.650
 chloroplast then we have here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 represented various plastics of the type 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.160
 chloroplasts what the pigment is really 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.290
 chloroplasts present in chlorophyll and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.240
 here I 'll take advantage to describe 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.730
 the types of chlorophyll that are 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.600
 present in the smaller ones we have 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.850
 necessarily chlorophyll and also the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 chlorophyll b 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.470
 another structure that is also 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.380
 their goal is present in the vacuum is nÃ³is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.519
 contractile what is the function of this vacuum 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.400
 good contr. as I told you to 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.269
 majority of his goal and nord lives in water 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 candy 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.230
 So let's remember the classes of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
 osmosis 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.530
 when we saw that cells that are 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:29.410
 in hypotonic emails, ie less means 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.470
 concentrates are subject to receiving the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.989
 water through osmosis or water 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.350
 will pass from the middle that is less 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.350
 concentrate for the medium that is most 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.880
 concentrate and this can happen with 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 Lenny says 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.519
 Your godoy's cytoplasm says it's more 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.700
 concentrate the environment where they live 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.730
 which is fresh water if this water enters 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.670
 there was no defense of the cell of the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.670
 euro is in relation to this 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.650
 cell could explode because one of the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.890
 characteristics of this cell 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.790
 it is also that it has no wall 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.069
 cell phone 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.549
 What we have here is only one 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.579
 not the cell wall 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.410
 then because of osmoze the session in 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.579
 could break 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.000
 but the counter-valve captures this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.720
 excess water and sends the excess of 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.919
 back to the external environment and such 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.460
 the function of this circle is precisely 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:39.240
 eliminate this excess of water what goes 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.720
 protect the cell against the effects of 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.419
 osmosis 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.190
 And as I already told you about the film, 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.889
 film has below it some 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.099
 fibrils which are structures that allow 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.560
 the hiring of this cell and for 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:00.789
 I want to finish talking about the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.990
 versatility of eugra nols in relation to 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:07.240
 to nutrition using children who have 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.810
 chloro steps such as leaves and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.270
 night I represented that they are to geek 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.490
 they are able to produce their 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.880
 own food 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.520
 but some species of lesser angla says 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.260
 no color in steps 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.610
 soon they can not perform 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.080
 photosynthesis 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.050
 ie they are and will have trophic them 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.930
 need to eat foods that are 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.729
 present in the middle and they do so 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.669
 management through phagocytosis and such ash 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.099
 or smaller ones have chloroplast they will 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.820
 photosynthesis if they do not 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.500
 have color the step they will absorb the 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.470
 nutrients 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.620
 but it looks interesting to use the smaller ones 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.030
 who own the color and do 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.720
 photosynthesis 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:05.229
 in the absence of light and then we 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.969
 structure of the importance of this 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.409
 to structure 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:14.499
 algae cell in case there is no light 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.999
 I is nÃ³is that have chloroplasts 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:20.860
 They may then also perform phagocytosis 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.119
 if they are prevented from performing 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.569
 photosynthesis 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:29.349
 they can absorb nutrients that are 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:33.039
 present in the medium through phagocytosis 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:36.639
 how versatile they are and what the 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:39.849
 the energy reserve material of your 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:44.319
 minor says a substance that is also a 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.159
 polysaccharide called paramillo good 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.199
 folks 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:50.259
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:53.499
 next class we will see the two 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:55.919
 the last children of seaweed do not 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:55.919
 until then
