00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
know so the biggest thing that I saw

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
know so the biggest thing that I saw
here<00:00:41.400> was<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.330> miscommunication<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
here was just miscommunication and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.320 
here was just miscommunication and
miscommunication<00:00:44.460> primarily<00:00:44.880> for<00:00:45.150> two

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
miscommunication primarily for two

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.130 
miscommunication primarily for two
reasons<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.470> first<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:48.300> unintentional

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
reasons the first is your unintentional

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.439 
reasons the first is your unintentional
reinforcement<00:00:49.830> what<00:00:50.100> you're

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
reinforcement what you're

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.460 
reinforcement what you're
unintentionally<00:00:51.449> promoting<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.320> you're

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
unintentionally promoting what you're

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.410 
unintentionally promoting what you're
unintentionally<00:00:53.190> nurturing<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> lot<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
unintentionally nurturing a lot of that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
unintentionally nurturing a lot of that
has<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.019> timing<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.430> seeing

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
has to do with timing when we're seeing

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.460 
has to do with timing when we're seeing
good<00:00:56.940> boy<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.540> we're<00:00:57.750> seeing<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.199> boy<00:00:58.410> for

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
good boy what we're seeing good boy for

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.369 
good boy what we're seeing good boy for
that<00:00:59.190> intent<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.269> handlers<00:01:00.750> Minds<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that intent in the handlers Minds is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
that intent in the handlers Minds is
obviously<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.670> better<00:01:02.880> but<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:04.020> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
obviously for the better but what the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.900 
obviously for the better but what the
dog<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.500> getting<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:05.009> of<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> based<00:01:05.700> on

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
dog is getting out of it is based on

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.030 
dog is getting out of it is based on
when<00:01:06.300> you're<00:01:06.570> seeing<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> treating<00:01:07.470> rewarding

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
when you're seeing is treating rewarding

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.889 
when you're seeing is treating rewarding
and<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> timing<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> little

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
and I think that the timing is a little

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.050 
and I think that the timing is a little
bit<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.560> other<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:11.280> speaking<00:01:11.940> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
bit off the other thing is speaking the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
bit off the other thing is speaking the
language<00:01:12.420> you're<00:01:12.869> constantly<00:01:13.290> hearing<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
language you're constantly hearing the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
language you're constantly hearing the
repeating<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.430> boy<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.820> leaving<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> no

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
repeating of good boy of leaving of no

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
repeating of good boy of leaving of no
and<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> dog<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.470> no<00:01:16.680> idea<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.160> these

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and the dog has no idea what these

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
and the dog has no idea what these
things<00:01:17.460> mean<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.820> mean<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> granted<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> dog

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
things mean I mean I granted the dog

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
things mean I mean I granted the dog
knows<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> sit<00:01:19.440> but<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:20.190> hasn't<00:01:20.340> been

No

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.630 

and<00:02:17.209> he's<00:02:17.330> actually<00:02:17.920> starting<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.129> learn<00:02:19.250> to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640

and he's actually starting to learn to
actually<00:02:20.060> follow<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.019> this<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.560> much

better

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.339 
better
we<00:02:22.760> haven't<00:02:23.060> even<00:02:23.150> left<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.569> complex<00:02:24.080> yet

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
we haven't even left the complex yet

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.390 
we haven't even left the complex yet
technically<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.580> he's<00:02:25.700> already<00:02:25.849> walking

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
technically and he's already walking

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.619 
technically and he's already walking
and<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.519> thought<00:02:27.909> you<00:02:28.120> want<00:02:28.299> him<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.510> know<00:02:28.599> that

just going in

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.180 
just going in
his<00:03:47.879> approach<00:03:48.270> was<00:03:48.510> better<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.590> still<00:03:49.800> needed

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
his approach was better but still needed

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.619 
his approach was better but still needed
a<00:03:50.250> question<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.819> he<00:03:50.879> got<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.390> dog

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
a question and he got it from the dog

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.080 
a question and he got it from the dog
and<00:03:51.980> Rizzo<00:03:52.980> laughs<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.400> question<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.910> not

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and Rizzo laughs the question was not

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.300 
and Rizzo laughs the question was not
him<00:03:54.330> taking<00:03:54.629> it<00:03:54.720> personal<00:03:55.230> or<00:03:55.590> or<00:03:55.980> fighting

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
him taking it personal or or fighting

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.130 
him taking it personal or or fighting
because<00:03:56.670> then<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:57.120> wasn't<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.510> fighting<00:03:57.900> type

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
because then it wasn't a fighting type

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.020 
because then it wasn't a fighting type
of<00:03:58.349> snap<00:03:58.620> he<00:03:58.950> respected<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.580> door<00:03:59.760> when<00:03:59.940> he

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
of snap he respected the door when he

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.240 
of snap he respected the door when he
approached<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:01.200> was<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.379> good<00:04:01.709> meat<00:04:01.920> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
approached and it was a good meat so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:16.449 
approached and it was a good meat so
that<00:04:02.280> was<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.550> definitely<00:04:03.000> good<00:04:03.180> turnout

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.340
