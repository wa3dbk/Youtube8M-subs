ramekin<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:12.250> we're<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.550> leave<00:02:12.730> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
ramekin and then we're going to leave it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.700 
ramekin and then we're going to leave it
for<00:02:13.030> about<00:02:13.150> ten<00:02:13.480> minutes<00:02:13.690> until<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.560> goes

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
for about ten minutes until it goes

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.640 
for about ten minutes until it goes
slightly<00:02:15.220> hard<00:02:15.480> next<00:02:16.480> we're<00:02:16.690> gonna<00:02:16.780> finish<00:02:17.290> up

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
slightly hard next we're gonna finish up

melted sugar palm sugar into the egg

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.000 
melted sugar palm sugar into the egg
mixture<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.310> whisk<00:02:39.490> together<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.920> have

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
mixture and just whisk together you have

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.400 
mixture and just whisk together you have
to<00:02:42.130> be<00:02:42.220> careful<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.090> warm<00:02:43.570> because<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
to be careful that it is warm because it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.350 
to be careful that it is warm because it
gets<00:02:44.530> too<00:02:44.800> hot<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.460> gonna<00:02:45.640> scramble

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
gets too hot it's just gonna scramble

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.720 
gets too hot it's just gonna scramble
your<00:02:46.510> eggs<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.920> custard<00:02:51.370> done

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
your eggs that is the custard done

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.540 
your eggs that is the custard done
that's<00:02:52.270> pretty<00:02:52.600> easy<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:54.190> I'm<00:02:54.370> gonna

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
that's pretty easy really now I'm gonna

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.600 
that's pretty easy really now I'm gonna
pour<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.330> custard<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:56.440> into<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.830> jug<00:02:57.220> which

pour the custard back into a jug which

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.220 
pour the custard back into a jug which
means<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.030> gonna<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.210> easier<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.810> pour<00:02:59.080> into

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
means it's gonna be easier to pour into

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.680 
means it's gonna be easier to pour into
your<00:02:59.350> ramekins<00:02:59.760> mm-hmm<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.210> I'm<00:03:01.390> gonna<00:03:01.480> pour

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it through a sieve so that it kind of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.670 
it through a sieve so that it kind of
catches<00:03:03.190> any<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.480> big<00:03:04.510> bits<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.260> egg<00:03:05.470> or

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
catches any like big bits of egg or

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.610 
catches any like big bits of egg or
anything<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.490> could<00:03:06.640> be<00:03:06.820> there<00:03:07.620> any

anything like that it could be there any

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.280 
anything like that it could be there any
lumps<00:03:09.010> or<00:03:09.130> bumps<00:03:09.160> let's<00:03:09.820> get<00:03:09.970> them<00:03:10.090> out<00:03:13.290> look

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
lumps or bumps let's get them out look

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.600 
lumps or bumps let's get them out look

at me making a big mess it's alright get
your<00:03:18.730> custard<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.709> pour<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.860> very<00:03:20.890> slowly<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
your custard and pour it very slowly and

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.690 
your custard and pour it very slowly and
gently<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:22.300> top<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.810> caramel<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.700> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
gently on top of the caramel and just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.100 
gently on top of the caramel and just
keep<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.180> until<00:03:25.270> you<00:03:25.450> filled<00:03:25.750> up<00:03:25.900> each

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
keep going until you filled up each

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.830 
keep going until you filled up each
ramekin

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.940 

if<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.930> don't<00:03:35.109> want<00:03:35.260> any<00:03:35.379> of<00:03:35.469> the<00:03:35.560> foamy<00:03:35.799> stuff

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
if you don't want any of the foamy stuff

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.920 
if you don't want any of the foamy stuff
on<00:03:36.219> top<00:03:36.400> literally<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:36.939> use<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.299> spoon<00:03:37.599> as

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
on top literally just use your spoon as

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.720 
on top literally just use your spoon as
a<00:03:38.170> bit<00:03:38.379> of<00:03:38.469> a<00:03:38.530> barrier<00:03:38.889> so<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.189> doesn't<00:03:39.459> kind<00:03:39.670> of

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
a bit of a barrier so it doesn't kind of

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.110 
a bit of a barrier so it doesn't kind of
come<00:03:39.909> out<00:03:39.999> there<00:03:41.670> depends<00:03:42.670> how<00:03:42.760> much<00:03:42.879> of<00:03:43.030> a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
come out there depends how much of a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.500 
come out there depends how much of a
perfectionist<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.959> are<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.819> nearly<00:03:49.329> ready

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
perfectionist you are it's nearly ready

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.220 
perfectionist you are it's nearly ready
to<00:03:49.810> go<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.530> oven<00:03:50.560> one<00:03:51.549> last<00:03:51.819> bit<00:03:52.150> I've<00:03:53.019> got

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
to go in the oven one last bit I've got

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.640 
to go in the oven one last bit I've got
a<00:03:53.260> jug<00:03:53.560> off<00:03:53.799> this<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.219> fairly<00:03:54.519> hot<00:03:55.030> water<00:03:55.650> it's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
a jug off this is fairly hot water it's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.379 
a jug off this is fairly hot water it's
not<00:03:56.799> boiling<00:03:57.159> it's<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.609> from<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.969> tap<00:03:58.150> hot

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
not boiling it's just from the tap hot

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.140 
not boiling it's just from the tap hot
water<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:59.439> I'm<00:03:59.560> gonna<00:03:59.739> fill<00:04:00.189> up<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.700> tray

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
water and I'm gonna fill up the tray

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.080 
water and I'm gonna fill up the tray
until<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.169> comes<00:04:02.469> about<00:04:02.650> halfway<00:04:03.129> up<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.819> pots

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
until it comes about halfway up the pots

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.140 
until it comes about halfway up the pots
and<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:05.260> basically<00:04:05.650> helps<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.819> when<00:04:07.030> it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
and this basically helps it when it

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.490 
and this basically helps it when it
cooks<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.719> it<00:04:07.989> cooks<00:04:08.319> nice<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.859> evenly<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:10.500> it

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
cooks so it cooks nice and evenly and it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.759 
cooks so it cooks nice and evenly and it
doesn't<00:04:11.859> basically<00:04:12.250> scramble<00:04:12.699> the<00:04:12.849> eggs

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
doesn't basically scramble the eggs

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.219 
doesn't basically scramble the eggs
so<00:04:14.769> now<00:04:14.919> this<00:04:15.099> goes<00:04:15.370> into<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.730> oven<00:04:15.849> for<00:04:16.509> about

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
so now this goes into the oven for about

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.449 
so now this goes into the oven for about
25<00:04:17.799> minutes<00:04:18.549> half<00:04:18.820> an<00:04:19.090> hour<00:04:19.239> until<00:04:20.099> that<00:04:21.099> until

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
25 minutes half an hour until that until

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.430 
25 minutes half an hour until that until
basically<00:04:21.660> there's<00:04:22.660> just<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.900> really<00:04:23.080> little

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
basically there's just a really little

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.390 
basically there's just a really little
wobble<00:04:23.740> in<00:04:24.070> them<00:04:28.349> once<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.560> custards<00:04:30.070> are

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
wobble in them once the custards are

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.550 
wobble in them once the custards are
cooked<00:04:30.849> you<00:04:31.479> need<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.720> take<00:04:31.900> them<00:04:32.020> out<00:04:32.229> of<00:04:32.259> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
cooked you need to take them out of the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.159 
cooked you need to take them out of the
oven<00:04:32.590> leave<00:04:33.490> them<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.849> cool<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.449> then<00:04:34.960> it's

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
oven leave them to cool and then it's

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.620 
oven leave them to cool and then it's
best<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:36.009> pop<00:04:36.310> them<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.699> fridge<00:04:36.970> overnight

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
best to pop them in the fridge overnight
