00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.379
 and to know what jumped Christian 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.820
 ronaldo I do not know how we're going to do it today 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.180
 you are counting the system of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.009
 access and the difference of the outside 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.539
 game the other day that we calculate the 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.130
 christian speed today the truth is 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.550
 which is a very easy process that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.199
 you will understand all 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.849
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.790
 catch a Christian we see that he is 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.649
 slightly tilted in the image 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.690
 we take your line that runs all your 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.870
 body and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.870
 To be 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.500
 rotate it so that we have to 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.050
 Christian right now let's say the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 right so to speak and once what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 we have the right to Christian scale turns 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.030
 because I have it 2nd turn because it is 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.730
 slightly inclined and we have to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
 know your real height with the actual height 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.560
 what we do is scale the image and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.990
 then treat the image so to speak 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.120
 well once we know we scale the 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.030
 image and effectively Christian min 185 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.710
 that his height of his actual height with what 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.020
 which we already know we have, let's say the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.300
 scale image well what we are going to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.010
 do is going to be in three steps we are going to 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.990
 calculate how much Christians jump first 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.340
 when right now he's on the ground 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.930
 then when it starts to jump and then 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.100
 when it reaches the highest point that is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
 just before finishing what's left 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.150
 suspended and that's where we're going to take 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.580
 the measurement and see how much it really jumps 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 how much is above the ground and the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.340
 first simple step that is what 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.560
 that you see here well the second step is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.740
 when it starts to start so 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 say it if we measure we have several already 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.500
 several points taken in the head in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.679
 the toes of the feet and the defense 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.509
 of manchester well yes if we outlined these 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.409
 measurements for example we can observe that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.409
 Christian rises 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.350
 It rises to about 31 centimeters 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.909
 start more or less to start salt 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 yes to start the jump about 31 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.230
 centimeters if the exact takeoff and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.860
 respect to the ground 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.670
 It rises to about 230 meters 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.390
 approximately 85 because it is to add 185 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.599
 more 0 30 more or less well off 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.159
 next step in this case would be to see the 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.650
 just when the ball arrives 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.180
 that picks up the legs plus what 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.510
 which gives the center even more height 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.670
 of the soil and past what is good if 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.130
 we measure 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.319
 if we measure for example how much how much 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.920
 is regarding the ground is 123 123 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.930
 meters is there is it will be about 90 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.569
 centimeters more or less like a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.239
 kitchen countertop 90 centimeters is 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:59.739
 still above yes yes we already measured 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.860
 respect your head when you're at 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.459
 respect to the ground it is two meters 93 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.459
 almost 3 meters 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.760
 and if on top we measure for example strand to 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.330
 how much is it to see about it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.330
 of the defense 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.780
 it is one meter 14 above the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.780
 defending 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.000
 the saint since then would be how much 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:47.230
 the jump is 1 123 meters compared to 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:49.150
 floor and the height of your head is at 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.710
 almost 3 meters compared to the July video 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.750
 if it has been put in the ring of 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.060
 basketball 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.710
 jumping 123 seems to us an outrage not 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.830
 I know if it's above this table is a 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.830
 burrada 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.670
 it's about 95 95 centimeters as 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.220
 a kitchen countertop as a child 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.570
 to the computer if more or less 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.670
 in the mind of the active the eyes are 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.440
 at two meters 80 and I accept and this guy in 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.930
 the head when it was high daycare 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.480
 by 240 and something 242 is above 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.000
 goal puts her in the basket looks like 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.250
 quite 05 or the head puts it to the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 height of the well what we have done is 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.180
 take this picture is not seen although we have 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.190
 caught the month tilt and in the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.200
 air 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.090
 we have taken more or less its measure that 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.090
 They are about 169 meters 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.270
 we have done the same thing that we have done in 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.580
 the previous case we have shot him down 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.190
 so to say it rotated to see messi for 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.800
 let's say to see messi in true 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:01.920
 magnitude and completely straight well if 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:03.870
 we measured 31 69 61 69 drilled him though 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.660
 if we take this measure and rotate it 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.900
 indeed we see that for example 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.370
 this foot the left is about 0 91 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.969
 respect to the ground, almost one meter is 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.069
 very much the truth 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.499
 the most delayed foot caught by the heel 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.559
 without counting the tip are about 72 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.819
 centimeters and let's say your head 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.370
 regarding the sun or it would be about two 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.780
 meters 23 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.340
 approximately this is very different 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.570
 jump to the sides is very different I 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:37.400
 I can be a meter with one leg 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:38.930
 so the theme is to have both but I 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.430
 I have caught the same quite another point and 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.740
 it's exactly the same 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.770
 measures we're all thinking would be of 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.970
 about 223 2 months the total your head is 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.530
 about 2 meters 23 feet is about 70 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.690
 centimeters more or less does not have the 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.070
 feet to zalamea half half audited 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.620
 minus 2 and then but digging a little 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.660
 more I have taken this goal several goals 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.670
 Christian and for example the one who marked the 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.550
 in the final of the champions 8 sun yes 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.410
 exact and we see that it is above the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.200
 stringer here as before your tree jump 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.240
 if we measure for example with respect to the ground 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.840
 we take more to increase this line of 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.160
 soil would be about 67 centimeters is 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.840
 with the feet completely down 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.780
 not like the previous case that has the 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.200
 the penalties collected above and above 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.380
 It is approximately two meters 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.389
 52 goal which is that I like the 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.990
 barbarity above is above 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:36.060
 the figure because they are 244 but then but 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.160
 then let's say beyond there is one 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.210
 there is a play that this is the truth that 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.090
 it's awesome that it's against the 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.419
 tottenham that here since he is not 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.120
 normal here is superhuman so 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.960
 say this would be the measure and here already 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.120
 well 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.100
 regarding the biggest thing with respect to 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.430
 So I would be 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.590
 a meter 24 is much more than the jump of 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.380
 tonight he did against manchester 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:06.380
 and then about him he also highlighted 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.290
 that is completely with which 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:15.190
 we can take the height much better 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:15.190
 and with respect to the ground it is 3 meters 9 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.300
 Well you just have to see for example 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.030
 gareth bale here in front or west if 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.940
 is that they are not, but the truth is that 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.910
 are all the photos of Christian are 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.940
 all for example if you look here because 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.620
 is above this player 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.110
 and here is above dani alves and 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.240
 they take it out a lot as it releases stress 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.120
 here where you get to the head where 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.740
 as forgiveness 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.460
 but that's the way it is and so if I just 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.460
 is looking at the món jumps
