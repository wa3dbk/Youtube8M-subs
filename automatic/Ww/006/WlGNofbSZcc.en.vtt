like this you can stay I don't know and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.339 
like this you can stay I don't know and
then<00:02:51.049> flip<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.290> head<00:02:52.470> up<00:02:53.840> pull<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> arms<00:02:55.230> like

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
then flip the head up pull the arms like

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:06.949 
then flip the head up pull the arms like
this<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.919> one<00:03:02.129> arm<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.389> other<00:03:06.510> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
this this is one arm this the other I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.020 
this this is one arm this the other I
wasn't<00:03:07.680> actually<00:03:07.769> intending<00:03:08.519> on<00:03:08.609> making

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
wasn't actually intending on making

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.869 
wasn't actually intending on making
these<00:03:09.180> things<00:03:09.829> but<00:03:10.829> digital's<00:03:11.250> look<00:03:11.430> nicer

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
these things but digital's look nicer

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.659 
these things but digital's look nicer
and<00:03:12.260> anyway<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.769> take<00:03:13.950> these<00:03:14.099> off<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.549> you

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
and anyway you can take these off if you

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.399 
and anyway you can take these off if you
want<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.030> doesn't<00:03:15.180> matter<00:03:15.329> well<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.260> just

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
want it doesn't matter well you just

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.960 
want it doesn't matter well you just
looks<00:03:16.620> nicer<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.099> this<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.729> you<00:03:17.849> can

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
looks nicer like this and you can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
looks nicer like this and you can
imagine<00:03:18.060> them<00:03:18.479> as<00:03:18.599> guns<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.199> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.129> flip

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
imagine them as guns and you can flip

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.309 
imagine them as guns and you can flip
the<00:03:20.400> guns<00:03:20.579> back<00:03:20.819> where<00:03:21.479> it's<00:03:21.599> like<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:24.319> yeah

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
the guns back where it's like this yeah

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.860 
the guns back where it's like this yeah
or<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.609> look<00:03:26.819> nicer<00:03:27.419> if<00:03:27.479> it's<00:03:27.659> under

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
or I think you look nicer if it's under

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.869 
or I think you look nicer if it's under
here<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.299> if<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.859> want<00:03:32.159> or<00:03:32.669> you<00:03:32.699> can
