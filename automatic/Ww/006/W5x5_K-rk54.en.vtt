dimension<00:00:12.450> Pro<00:00:13.040> vsti<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.299> see<00:00:15.480> here

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
dimension Pro vsti but you can see here

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.130 
dimension Pro vsti but you can see here
and<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.160> where<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:18.090> courts<00:00:18.600> generated

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and this is where the courts generated

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.970 
and this is where the courts generated
by<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:20.160> plug-in<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:20.850> gonna<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.240> played<00:00:21.980> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
by the plug-in now gonna be played and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.019 
by the plug-in now gonna be played and
I'm<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.279> go<00:00:23.550> ahead<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.060> open<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> plug-in

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
I'm gonna go ahead and open the plug-in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.109 
I'm gonna go ahead and open the plug-in
through<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.300> substance<00:00:28.140> menu<00:00:28.910> when<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> go

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
through the substance menu when I go

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.720 
through the substance menu when I go
ahead<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> insert<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.929> now<00:00:34.190> here<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

you cannot output your notes to your
dimension<00:00:46.350> Pro<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:48.840> now

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
dimension Pro so I want to be sure now

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
dimension Pro so I want to be sure now
that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.920> routing<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.550> routing<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> set

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that the routing the be routing is set

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
that the routing the be routing is set
up<00:00:51.570> properly<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.010> check

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
up properly so I'm gonna have to check

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.650 
up properly so I'm gonna have to check
in<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.030> dimension<00:00:54.300> Pro<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> MIDI<00:00:54.960> input<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
in my dimension Pro the MIDI input and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.540 
in my dimension Pro the MIDI input and
see<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.440> set<00:00:58.859> correctly<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.430> now

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
see that it's not set correctly so now

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.770 
see that it's not set correctly so now
I'm<00:00:59.609> gonna<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> set<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> improve

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I'm gonna have to set it to improve

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
I'm gonna have to set it to improve
easier<00:01:01.190> mediaomni<00:01:02.190> channel<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
easier mediaomni channel and now if I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:26.110 
easier mediaomni channel and now if I
click<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.030> chord

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.800 

there<00:01:26.870> it<00:01:27.110> plays<00:01:27.320> quite<00:01:27.740> nicely<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:29.570> how

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
there it plays quite nicely so now how

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.860

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
do I record in the MIDI track the chords

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.440 
do I record in the MIDI track the chords
have<00:01:32.960> just<00:01:33.200> played<00:01:33.440> well<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.760> really<00:01:35.090> just

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
of the chord progression but I'm gonna

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.710 
of the chord progression but I'm gonna
show<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.240> moment

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.120 

and<00:02:41.410> I'm<00:02:42.400> going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> open<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.510> noose<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.830> is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and I'm going to open a noose if that is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.750 
and I'm going to open a noose if that is
gonna<00:02:46.090> play<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> melody<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> I'm<00:02:48.490> gonna<00:02:48.640> go

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
gonna play the melody so I'm gonna go

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.400 
gonna play the melody so I'm gonna go
for<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.970> rapture<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.300> I'm<00:02:52.600> gonna<00:02:52.780> load<00:02:53.020> up<00:02:53.050> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
for a rapture and I'm gonna load up a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:02.790 
for a rapture and I'm gonna load up a
nice<00:02:59.010> program<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.820> idea<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.380> this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
nice program and the idea is that this

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.949 
nice program and the idea is that this
I'm<00:03:03.190> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> route<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.820> this<00:03:03.970> thing<00:03:04.270> the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
I'm going to route to this thing the

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.230 
I'm going to route to this thing the
highest<00:03:05.380> note<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.190> course<00:03:06.490> as<00:03:06.730> they<00:03:07.120> are

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
highest note of the course as they are

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.710 
highest note of the course as they are
generated<00:03:07.690> by<00:03:07.870> harmony<00:03:08.350> improve<00:03:08.800> easier<00:03:09.720> so

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
generated by harmony improve easier so

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.680 
generated by harmony improve easier so
how<00:03:10.930> do<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.170> do<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> well<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.580> need<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.540> make

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
how do I do that well I need to make

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.240 
how do I do that well I need to make
