00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.309
 salute meet today for 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 a technical tutorial it was a little 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.969
 moment on the post of the reach so it's 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.980
 you who asked me so I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 then do in free trade and one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 can find them like that so these are 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 open tickets up and hop 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.960
 or like that they are tickets 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.820
 actually folded to go from a ticket to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 the other therefore a well fold a real 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 open just open it 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.930
 like these is then the aisle 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 returned to the machine to mark the fold 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.010
 if you want to say maybe 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 ironing 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 so if you have looted goods that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 you like it do not hesitate to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 buy it will just open them 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 to iron them for a ticket 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 like that so laying that fact with 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.860
 open tickets I will show you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.840
 just now a ticket it serves to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 what a ticket is used to actually 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
 nice finish so you can 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.989
 use it to make the pass around 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 of your collar of your sleeves debating your 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.449
 creations tunics dresses but also for 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 sew intel bath sheets in the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 linens short range also 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.010
 it's a little everything you want 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 really the interest is to make 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.640
 nice finish and it's super nice 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 since there are two plans of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.439
 Cotton satin patterns in short biases 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.970
 these tables and we learn there everything from 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.619
 following how nausea 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 so I took my ticket to the state 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 open and as part of this tutorial I 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.030
 made a mark to mark the beginning of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 my bias so I take my ticket I 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.939
 position it here at the edge leaving me 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 a margin here of about 6 cm 7 cm is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 a bit like you want then I open 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.790
 my bias and I want to come the lineage 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.049
 with the edge of my fabric and pinned 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.649
 then I'm going to sew it to the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.030
 machine 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 so I'm going to sew here I go 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 sew to the machine with a fist 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.780
 right all the way through the fold 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.749
 [Music] 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.609
 when having walked around my fabric 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:11.019
 with my ticket I arrive more or less 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.280
 in connection point so here I am 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.690
 still far I still have two three 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.299
 centimeters but good here 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.069
 Well I stop I'll sew 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.330
 to make a breakpoint so I could have 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.810
 really stop me a lot a lot 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.940
 earlier kind even 8 cm it would not have 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.840
 been annoying ok so I 'll do my punched 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.370
 and I take off my ticket to make 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.750
 now their agreement between the beginning and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.190
 the end of the ticket there are two 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.810
 techniques I will present you a 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 and siasia soil is to present the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.629
 second on the blog 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.579
 so in fact so I take this 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.860
 part of the ticket I will fold it at 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.629
 middle of this space is well marked on 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.489
 country with us so that's good because 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.410
 that it's cotton and then I want 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.239
 do the same thing with that side but 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.609
 while getting as close as possible 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.829
 of that country in fact the purpose is that it 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.180
 there is almost no space then he 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.670
 can be a tiny one it's not 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.290
 serious but really tiny of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.910
 a few millimeters and a contrario 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.040
 same should not be superimposed on 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 the other to the other well otherwise it's not going 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.440
 to go so I mark well the fold then 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.019
 I take back my tickets and if I want I 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.090
 can traced to the rule something like that 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.480
 here and on the other side to have a 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.639
 trace of my fold I'm going to sew with a 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.769
 point of law on the so on my folds 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.750
 on the trace that I redrawn and there at 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.120
 the more you leave a space between 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.739
 the two parts of the reach the more it will be 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 easy of course so me as I them 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.880
 know barely 2 3 cm it's harder 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.680
 that if I had the Semites 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.329
 so next time I will see in 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.329
 leave 8 pretty much 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.650
 I will you my fabric to check that 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.170
 their chords is fine so this is the 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.630
 case of the coup I can cut the surplus 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.630
 here went to the next step 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.950
 now I'm going to return my fabric 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.970
 and then I'm going to bend my bias of 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:17.470
 so that they come 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:18.790
 cover the seam that is there that's it and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.820
 then I'm going to paint and all that and 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:26.310
 sew back to the machine I run 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.310
 and I cost at 1.2 mm from here 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:41.190
 [Music] 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.959
 [Music] 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.800
 and here I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.480
 I tell you next week to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.190
 learn to ask a ticket together 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.190
 in an angle see you soon
