00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
going to use half of it which is going

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.270 
going to use half of it which is going
to<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.280> 8<00:00:44.520> ounces<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.410> around<00:00:46.530> 200

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to be 8 ounces so that's around 200

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.410

calories<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> chicken<00:00:48.690> breast<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:50.420> half

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
calories and chicken breast and a half

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.529 
calories and chicken breast and a half
of<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.809> tablespoon<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.890> extra<00:00:53.879> virgin<00:00:53.910> olive

chicken<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> halfway<00:01:47.070> finished<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.479> we're

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
chicken is halfway finished so now we're

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.230

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
reason why we remove them is because the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
reason why we remove them is because the

breast so we don't want to burn our
pepper

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
