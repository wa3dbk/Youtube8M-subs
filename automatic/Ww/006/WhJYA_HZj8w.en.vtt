put in the outside as well to show that
I'm<00:01:04.170> adding<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:05.100> three<00:01:05.489> four<00:01:05.939> digit

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I'm adding these three four digit

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.380 
I'm adding these three four digit
numbers<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.979> underneath<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.580> columns<00:01:09.180> I'm

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
numbers and underneath my columns I'm

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.179 
numbers and underneath my columns I'm
going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> use<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> ruler<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.180> add<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.450> horizontal

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
going to use a ruler to add a horizontal

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.120 
going to use a ruler to add a horizontal
line<00:01:14.990> firstly<00:01:15.990> I've<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> add<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
line firstly I've got to add up the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.200 
line firstly I've got to add up the
units<00:01:17.720> 7<00:01:18.720> +<00:01:18.930> 6<00:01:19.740> +<00:01:20.130> 5<00:01:21.380> 7<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.560> 6<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.549> 5<00:01:24.030> gives<00:01:24.810> us<00:01:24.960> 18

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
units 7 + 6 + 5 7 at 6 at 5 gives us 18

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
units 7 + 6 + 5 7 at 6 at 5 gives us 18
because<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.600> using<00:01:27.840> compact<00:01:28.530> column

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
because we are using compact column

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
because we are using compact column
addition<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.850> must<00:01:30.030> partition<00:01:30.750> 18<00:01:31.290> into<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
addition we must partition 18 into the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.080 
addition we must partition 18 into the
tens<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.970> units<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:34.560> 18<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.759> see

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
tens and the units and in 18 we can see

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.289 
tens and the units and in 18 we can see
there<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:37.110> 10<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.329> 8<00:01:39.380> units<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
there is one 10 and 8 units to put this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.050 
there is one 10 and 8 units to put this
into<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:42.899> compact<00:01:43.470> column<00:01:43.799> addition<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.880> must

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
into our compact column addition we must

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.929 
into our compact column addition we must
put<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> 8<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.369> unit's<00:01:47.729> column

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
put the 8 down here in the unit's column

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.280 
put the 8 down here in the unit's column
and<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> 1<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.790> show<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.479> 110

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and just a 1 here to show there is 110

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.120 
and just a 1 here to show there is 110
which<00:01:52.829> we're<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.280> add<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.670> later<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:55.130> I'm

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
which we're going to add on later on I'm

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
which we're going to add on later on I'm
going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> use<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> ruler<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.750> draw<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.140> another

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
going to use a ruler to draw in another

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.670 
going to use a ruler to draw in another
horizontal<00:01:59.310> line<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.600> separate<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.469> two

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
horizontal line to separate the two

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.330 
horizontal line to separate the two
parts<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.189> my<00:02:02.250> working<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> next<00:02:04.829> step<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
parts of my working out the next step is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.719 
parts of my working out the next step is
to<00:02:05.850> add<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> tens<00:02:07.099> including<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.520> one

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to add up all the tens including the one

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.330 
to add up all the tens including the one
that<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.390> added<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.950> means

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that we have just added in so this means

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
that we have just added in so this means
40<00:02:12.150> add

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
40 add

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
are two hundreds now I've got to add up

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949 
are two hundreds now I've got to add up
all<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.340> numbers<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:48.120> are<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> hundreds

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
all the numbers that are in the hundreds

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.330 
all the numbers that are in the hundreds
column<00:02:49.760> 300<00:02:50.760> at<00:02:51.260> 200<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.670> 400<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:54.230> 200<00:02:55.340> this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
column 300 at 200 at 400 at 200 this

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.630 
column 300 at 200 at 400 at 200 this
gives<00:02:56.670> us<00:02:58.160> 1100<00:03:00.590> which<00:03:01.590> again<00:03:01.950> must<00:03:02.520> be

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
gives us 1100 which again must be

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.520 
gives us 1100 which again must be
partitioned<00:03:03.060> into<00:03:03.540> his<00:03:03.720> separate<00:03:04.080> numbers

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
partitioned into his separate numbers

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.320 
partitioned into his separate numbers
the<00:03:05.370> 1000<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:08.150> 100<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:11.250> write<00:03:11.430> these<00:03:11.700> into

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the 1000 and the 100 to write these into

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.360 
the 1000 and the 100 to write these into
our<00:03:12.360> compact<00:03:12.870> column<00:03:13.140> addition<00:03:13.590> I'm<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
our compact column addition I'm going to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.210 
our compact column addition I'm going to
put<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.730> 1<00:03:15.180> here<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:16.380> show<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.280> 100<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
put a 1 here to show there is 100 and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.699 
put a 1 here to show there is 100 and
the<00:03:20.220> one<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.750> show<00:03:21.780> there<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.470> 1000

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
the one here to show there is 1000

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.590 
the one here to show there is 1000
finally<00:03:25.709> I've<00:03:25.950> got<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> add<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.790> all<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
finally I've got to add up all the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.150 
finally I've got to add up all the
thousands<00:03:28.790> 5000<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:30.290> 2000<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.739> 1000<00:03:32.730> AD<00:03:33.140> 1000

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
thousands 5000 at 2000 at 1000 AD 1000

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.610 
thousands 5000 at 2000 at 1000 AD 1000
this<00:03:35.160> gives<00:03:35.489> us<00:03:35.640> nine<00:03:36.060> thousand<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.380> just

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
this gives us nine thousand so I just

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.449 
this gives us nine thousand so I just
write<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.830> nine<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:39.350> we<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:40.560> our<00:03:40.980> answer

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
write a nine here we now have our answer

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.160 
write a nine here we now have our answer
at<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.940> bottom<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.690> compact

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
at the bottom of the compact

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.050 
at the bottom of the compact
accommodation<00:03:44.299> 9000<00:03:45.860> 128<00:03:46.860> but<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.760> must

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
accommodation 9000 128 but I must

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.840 
accommodation 9000 128 but I must
remember<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.720> write<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.350> out<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:49.860> part<00:03:50.610> of
