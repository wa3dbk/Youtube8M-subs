00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:01.050

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.780
 trap and I know well who is my dad and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.130

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.610
 time to leave a note to look at what 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.710

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770
 do 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.700

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.860

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.640

 the strip of the river if I'm julieta like that's enough 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.689
 of suffering enough to cry 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.810

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.730

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.239
 enough reason for whining and now 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.129
 also permission first thing so 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.609

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.650
 Various colors for that good 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.560
 listen to me among the clothes you threw 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.849
 there was a violet shirt with green with 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 white strips 6 the strip given 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.680
 mariano good 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.000
 with good love do not worry when you 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.680
 cases if we want with Paul and we finish 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.450
 the outside also set detail 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.450
 of all this you can find 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.490
 I have already decided 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.990
 I have to be well dressed on 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.990
 I accompany julieta I have to be 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.080
 but I think it would be so 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.150
 important that they be next to the 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.740
 girlfriend taking care of her and time for you not 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.480
 I will have the same thing as 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.320
 disguised as a nurse to conquer me 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.380
 I am not a girl of this society and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.140
 no marriages with heavy guys 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.709
 then that heavy one is going to fix in 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.709
 new horizons 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200
 all right
