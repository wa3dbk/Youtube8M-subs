then I remove my clips and a towel and

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.690 
then I remove my clips and a towel and
then<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.630> put<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:17.989> my<00:04:18.280> curly<00:04:19.280> tea<00:04:19.459> towel<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:21.700> I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
then I put on my curly tea towel and I

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.490 
then I put on my curly tea towel and I
leave<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.000> for<00:04:23.120> about<00:04:23.330> 10<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.960> 20<00:04:24.229> minutes

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
leave it on for about 10 to 20 minutes

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.770 
leave it on for about 10 to 20 minutes
it<00:04:25.340> depends<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:25.940> what<00:04:26.240> I'm<00:04:26.330> doing

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.720 

so<00:04:30.780> after<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> moved<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.500> curly<00:04:31.950> tea<00:04:32.130> towel<00:04:32.370> I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
so after I moved it curly tea towel I

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.240 
so after I moved it curly tea towel I
take<00:04:32.970> down<00:04:33.150> my<00:04:33.360> hair<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.380> moisturize<00:04:34.830> and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
take down my hair and I moisturize and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.970 
take down my hair and I moisturize and
seal<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> use<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.110> lco<00:04:37.500> method

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
seal it I like to use the lco method

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.500 
seal it I like to use the lco method
that's<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.310> method<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.760> works<00:04:38.970> great<00:04:39.300> for

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
that's the method that works great for

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.090 
that's the method that works great for
my<00:04:39.660> hair<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.090> my<00:04:42.180> hair<00:04:42.450> at<00:04:42.860> 80%<00:04:43.860> dry

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
my hair so this is my hair at 80% dry

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.530 
my hair so this is my hair at 80% dry
I'm<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:44.490> going<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.790> put<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.060> back<00:04:45.150> in<00:04:45.420> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
I'm just going to put it back in the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
I'm just going to put it back in the
fourth<00:04:45.780> section<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.560> makes<00:04:46.890> things<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.310> much

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
fourth section this makes things so much

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.000 
fourth section this makes things so much
easier<00:04:47.790> for<00:04:47.820> me<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.380> then<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> make<00:04:49.680> smaller

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
easier for me and then I make smaller

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.950 
easier for me and then I make smaller
sections<00:04:51.020> starting<00:04:52.020> with<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.230> back

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.000 

so<00:04:57.960> now<00:04:58.050> we're<00:04:58.169> going<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.350> use<00:04:58.530> my<00:04:58.740> leave-in
