is<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> laser-cut<00:01:09.270> kit<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.820> these<00:01:11.820> airplanes

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is the laser-cut kit so these airplanes

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.899 
is the laser-cut kit so these airplanes
have<00:01:12.510> been<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.159> long<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.460> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so that they can either buy a full kit a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.759 
so that they can either buy a full kit a
partial<00:02:31.709> kit<00:02:31.980> or<00:02:32.310> any<00:02:33.380> breakdown<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.410> any

piece<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.340> part<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.790> they<00:02:35.940> want<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> it's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
piece in part that they want so it's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.250 
piece in part that they want so it's
more<00:02:38.160> convenient<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> customer<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> if

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
more convenient for the customer so if

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
more convenient for the customer so if
somebody<00:02:40.560> were<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.739> take<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> project<00:02:41.760> like

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
somebody were to take the project like

people<00:03:00.329> would<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.600> been<00:03:00.630> working<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.410> do

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
people would have been working on to do

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.890 
people would have been working on to do
this<00:03:01.709> ten<00:03:02.519> or<00:03:02.670> twelve<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.660> I'm<00:03:03.720> just

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
this ten or twelve you know I'm just

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
this ten or twelve you know I'm just
like<00:03:04.079> on<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> part-time<00:03:04.590> basis<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> part-time

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
like on a part-time basis on a part-time

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.500 
like on a part-time basis on a part-time
basis<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.470> average<00:03:07.890> 300<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.820> 400<00:03:09.390> dollars

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.539 
basis on the average 300 to 400 dollars
for<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.470> person<00:03:10.860> would<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.040> able<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.280> go<00:03:11.430> in

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
for one person would be able to go in

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:11.940 
for one person would be able to go in
and<00:03:11.700> fill

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
and fill

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.949 
and fill
yeah<00:03:12.160> now<00:03:12.819> what<00:03:13.000> are<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.209> cards<00:03:13.810> are

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
yeah now what are the cards are

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.670 
yeah now what are the cards are
pointless<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.099> has<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.580> mg<00:03:16.150> 202<00:03:16.900> engine

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.070 

other<00:03:23.680> engine<00:03:24.430> options<00:03:25.150> are<00:03:25.840> going<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.020> be

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
other engine options are going to be

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.400 
other engine options are going to be
available<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:27.010> few<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:28.000> our<00:03:28.239> other<00:03:28.300> arrow<00:03:28.780> maxes

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
available a few of our other arrow maxes

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.520 
available a few of our other arrow maxes
have<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.100> earth<00:03:30.780> F<00:03:31.780> 23<00:03:32.770> on<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:34.140> some<00:03:35.140> have<00:03:35.380> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
have the earth F 23 on it some have the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.850 
have the earth F 23 on it some have the
Rotax<00:03:35.950> engines<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.640> them<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.420> there's<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.470> 503

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
Rotax engines on them so there's the 503

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.580 
Rotax engines on them so there's the 503
so<00:03:39.489> there's<00:03:39.760> quite<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> few<00:03:40.630> options<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.440> we

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
so there's quite a few options and we

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:52.110 
so there's quite a few options and we
can<00:03:41.620> accommodate<00:03:42.099> any<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.700> those<00:03:42.819> options<00:03:51.120> we

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
can accommodate any of those options we

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:01.770 
can accommodate any of those options we
started<00:03:59.430> we<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.459> hoping<00:04:01.000> by<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.239> end<00:04:01.450> of

this on what kind of facilities are they
going<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.110> need<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.440> finish<00:05:15.590> because<00:05:15.950> this

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
going to need to finish because this

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.950 
going to need to finish because this

most of your standard hand tools will

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.570 
most of your standard hand tools will
work<00:05:41.720> for<00:05:42.139> building<00:05:42.500> this<00:05:42.650> laser<00:05:42.950> cut<00:05:43.280> yet

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
work for building this laser cut yet

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.659 
work for building this laser cut yet
because<00:05:43.910> everything's<00:05:44.390> cut<00:05:44.810> for<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.229> as<00:05:46.160> far

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
because everything's cut for you as far

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.330 
because everything's cut for you as far
as<00:05:46.820> all<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.060> hardware<00:05:47.660> it's<00:05:48.410> all<00:05:48.590> machine<00:05:48.979> for
