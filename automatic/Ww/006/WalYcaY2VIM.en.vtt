00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.779
 the first configuration on your tablet 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.320

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.610
 this is the one of his 7 2013 the first thing is 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.890
 catch the Spanish language let's continue 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.460
 we choose the wifi network to which we are going 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.870
 to connect this is necessary or 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.660
 you always have to have internet to 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 and we click on connect 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.150
 there will be the connection 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.420
 ask if we have google account 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.190
 If you do not have google account they can 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.190
 create right here telling you not to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.300

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.730

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.060
