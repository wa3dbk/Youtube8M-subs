winter fishery these are winter spinners

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
winter fishery these are winter spinners
and<00:00:46.050> they're<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.410> types<00:00:47.059> but<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you're gonna hit them somewhere with the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.799 
you're gonna hit them somewhere with the
spear<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> he's<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.030> slip<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.390> between

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
spear and he's going to slip in between

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.200 
spear and he's going to slip in between
these<00:00:57.930> two<00:00:58.170> prongs<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.910> drive

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
these two prongs and you're gonna drive

into the mud and then when you pull the
spear<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> mud<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.449> hook

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
spear out of the mud you're gonna hook

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
spear out of the mud you're gonna hook
them<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> hook<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.040> you'll<00:01:05.189> feel<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
them on the hook then you'll feel the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
them on the hook then you'll feel the
weight<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.750> haul<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> spear<00:01:07.590> out

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
weight then you haul that spear out

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.700 
weight then you haul that spear out
really<00:01:07.950> quick<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> go

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
really quick so when you do this you go

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.140 
really quick so when you do this you go
right<00:01:10.890> straight<00:01:11.130> through<00:01:11.220> together

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:28.910 

okay<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.400> summer<00:01:26.759> fishery<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.380> big

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
okay this is a summer fishery it's a big

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
okay this is a summer fishery it's a big
mod<00:01:29.100> design<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.850> you'd<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> bone<00:01:30.869> prong

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
mod design and you'd have a bone prong

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
mod design and you'd have a bone prong
but<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> water<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> two<00:01:33.329> steel<00:01:33.570> bar<00:01:33.840> up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
but the water think is two steel bar up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.950 
but the water think is two steel bar up
in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> middle<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.680> spearmen<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.840> open<00:01:36.840> up

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in the middle you spearmen these open up

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.630 
in the middle you spearmen these open up
and<00:01:37.820> do<00:01:38.820> gets<00:01:39.240> caught<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.310> held<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and do gets caught in here held in with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
and do gets caught in here held in with
the<00:01:41.729> barb<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> can't<00:01:42.450> slip<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the barb and you can't slip out so in

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.920 
the barb and you can't slip out so in
making<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:44.250> fish<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.820> basically<00:01:45.270> carve

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
making these fish you basically carve

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
making these fish you basically carve
out<00:01:46.110> sticks<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> ash<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> birch<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
out sticks out of ash of a birch and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.990 
out sticks out of ash of a birch and
this<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> pitchfork<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this was a pitchfork when they go on a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.679 
this was a pitchfork when they go on a
pole<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.790> distance

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
pole they will be the right distance

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
pole they will be the right distance
apart<00:01:55.100> okay<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.219> we're<00:01:56.460> gonna<00:01:56.549> make<00:01:56.640> these

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
apart okay so we're gonna make these

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.840 
apart okay so we're gonna make these
things<00:01:57.469> when<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.799> Neal<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.340> guys<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
things when you see Neal these guys to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.010 
things when you see Neal these guys to
eel<00:02:00.060> into<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> prongs<00:02:00.840> over

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
eel into the prongs over

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.499 
eel into the prongs over
this<00:02:02.369> sometimes<00:02:03.369> it's<00:02:03.759> hard<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.060> teach<00:02:04.240> our

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
this sometimes it's hard to teach our

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.419 
this sometimes it's hard to teach our
kids<00:02:04.539> how<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:04.990> think<00:02:05.109> this<00:02:05.890> one's<00:02:06.130> better

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
kids how to think this one's better

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.850 
kids how to think this one's better
because<00:02:06.640> one<00:02:07.600> struggles<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.289> one<00:02:08.470> component

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
because one struggles with one component

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.680 
because one struggles with one component
like<00:02:09.160> making<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.910> wood<00:02:10.119> part<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.539> it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
like making the wood part of it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.020 
like making the wood part of it
something<00:02:11.680> else<00:02:11.950> may<00:02:12.099> be<00:02:12.129> really<00:02:12.760> good<00:02:12.910> at

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
something else may be really good at

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.790 
something else may be really good at
making<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.450> steel<00:02:13.720> part<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.319> yeah<00:02:14.560> no<00:02:14.680> one

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
making a steel part of it yeah no one

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.770 
making a steel part of it yeah no one
may<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:14.980> where<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> find<00:02:15.519> poles<00:02:15.879> but<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> told

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
may know where to find poles but I told

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.210 
may know where to find poles but I told
me<00:02:16.959> I'll<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.530> together<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.160> make

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
me I'll have to get together and make

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.430 
me I'll have to get together and make
this<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.910> future<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.170> part
