00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.610
 That opinion gives taste there 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.999
 and we are going to detect this 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.919
 Maybe what he does is my profile 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.980
 Here you can modify state 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.550
 In this case he 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.319
 I could put anything 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.149
 In this case I will put pola 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.420
 iae been what then to miguel I have 81 friends 12 games and 64 achievements 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.330
 like here point two friends who have added me for 100 million in 3 and the pp ' 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.590
 and for example you do not know any of these loaves for tracy minds is that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 to the top 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 sorry, sorry 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.230

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.410
 and well here we have that it has 15 games 65 achievements and two friends 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.500
 the good bailing appear all know as authentic of that work 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.270
 although of course it is covered bivens 4 blair controls chimera yanqui aside me 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 they look like all the two he has 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.290
 p that I do not have to be harmed nba and cooperates touch joaqui two of these others 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.620
 and so it is common that any profile 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.330
 the one that is alex hours and how much he had 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.840
 he is a youtube can dry your YouTube channel in 3 min 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.570
 It's a very good I had a hundred 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.450
 i was one more in this case we have was my doctor amount of time all these 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.400
 other games 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.660
 he has 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 351 friends 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.080
 And well, well, and it's all my friends, we can see it for bad weather 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 and so as it works with friends what I find here all my 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.510
 games 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.730
 Reviews are 12 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.380
 and I think how many achievements you have, for example, although households have 48 achievements and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.760
 only completed 12 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.060
 then here I show all the achievements that I have complete and he tells me that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 I have to do 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.510
 for example here this one that does not lack says 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.380
 in the same 5 that ends the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.360
 world 5 and that's how you almost all end up on the classification table what then 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.109
 ere by friends or everyone 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.850
 it does not matter what game you are going to see 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.469
 It can always be olic week 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.049
 and there is still 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.430
 also paid that puts here site in vita there a request here reaches you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.549
 already to the zetas 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.299
 all right 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.709
 and if I wanted to invite someone for example water 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.860
 was with india only invited him to field did not dodge to give example then to 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.859
 note that which was clean 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.589
 I'm here 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.589
 in the game is loading 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.339
 the girls a 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.519
 of my favorites without any doubt 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.129
 he always spent it playing 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.149
 because she who for example seems to me 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.319
 no balloon with the manifold and now 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.109
 miguel covián there I connect convincing 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.219
 multiple pxc she 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.889
 and the montpellier and here in center in this case from here was to invite a 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.229
 friend to play 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.229
 for now he's going to load all 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.029
 that here are all friends allow more than one neste case I will 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.319
 put this 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.780
 a random game I select someone 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.209
 even if it's not my friend and good to play with someone 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.760
 rick just as nobody finds out that he is now in 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.589
 online game for 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:28.799
 jasmine ya 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.659
 a shirt and the rules of the game and this case goes against a 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.439
 tonic gral 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.679
 and the one that we do not know which country is 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.679
 and apparently he's letting her play alone 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.649
 anoeta when 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:47.229
 they said is convincingly logical floor of a winner and all that for 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.639
 celebration goes well in fact more than a couple of days 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.929
 of them center is granted 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:57.139
 7 I really like the idea that turning on yes yes we could compare with something 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.309
 and more or less serious with 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.349
 it is without a doubt with es vox la ain 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.949
 is what older could say that looks like 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.949
 but think 3 unique he I recommend you a lot 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.830
 you already have it by default tencas policy for four points one to have it 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.090
 in this one and as in all the models he does not 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.120
 but in those who can not have in enjoy it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.809
 It informs to put it in other models but it is very complicated because they block 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:28.720
 ted is something a little different you do not have to do a tutorial 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.979
 Merkel can not all enjoy something well 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.569
 but the tedh that the center 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.979
 of adeje month and he 10 and then this was all I'm the doctor chil 10% and also 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.869
 something that I wanted to tell you we left center well for what is going to vary 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.050
 among all 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 percent 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.400
