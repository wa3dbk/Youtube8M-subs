00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:30.230 
I said that this goes on the side I
really<00:06:16.830> really<00:06:17.159> don't<00:06:17.279> like<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:28.189> but<00:06:29.240> really

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
really really don't like it but really

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.529 
really really don't like it but really
this<00:06:30.419> just<00:06:30.930> looks<00:06:31.199> thrown<00:06:31.620> together<00:06:35.539> it's

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
this just looks thrown together it's

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:43.159 
this just looks thrown together it's
terrible<00:06:37.939> really<00:06:38.939> it<00:06:39.330> does<00:06:41.719> it's<00:06:42.719> nothing

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
terrible really it does it's nothing

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.269 
terrible really it does it's nothing
compared<00:06:43.680> to<00:06:43.740> this<00:06:45.319> it<00:06:46.319> may<00:06:46.469> be<00:06:46.499> bigger<00:06:46.919> a

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
compared to this it may be bigger a

00:06:47.279 --> 00:07:01.909 
compared to this it may be bigger a
little<00:06:48.059> bit<00:06:58.550> but<00:06:59.550> yeah<00:07:00.389> this<00:07:01.169> one<00:07:01.439> looks

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
little bit but yeah this one looks

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:11.829 
little bit but yeah this one looks
thrown<00:07:02.159> together<00:07:02.339> this<00:07:03.089> one<00:07:03.300> good<00:07:06.800> yeah<00:07:07.800> I

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.559 

guess<00:07:12.839> that's<00:07:13.050> all<00:07:13.580> so<00:07:14.580> this<00:07:14.879> is<00:07:15.060> powerful

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
guess that's all so this is powerful

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.969 
guess that's all so this is powerful
verse<00:07:15.719> 14<00:07:16.259> saying<00:07:16.770> see<00:07:17.669> you<00:07:17.759> later
