00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 the ball twice higher than a year earlier but yes 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.659
 see if it clicks 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.529
 this propelled a weaker dollar 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.720
 there is also another year 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.560
 the columns 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.369
 on 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 8 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.660
 the course suits me and if you are also just short of the ball 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.900
 but for the package 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.900
 I have a lot 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.190
 to impose a couple 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 I unpacked it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 I will find you below 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 to a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 h 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.900
 also watch out 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 it's always easy but on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 especially in demand 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 jakkes 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.390
 has been around for years 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.940
 the total costs 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.939
 a happy ending 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.270
 remarkably often required 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.580
 hoped for it 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 the edition 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 we offer him 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.920
 but on 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 how is that possible 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.510
 practically pulverized 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.040
 solved this time 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.800
 what do you do when i teach the players 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.219
 delfzijl are sitting on the polder here 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.079
 he brings 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.079
 I think I am this 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.859
 in the sixties 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.139
 apparently unreasonable dismissal I would not like 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.399
 has wilders on the surface 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.399
 or having a jerk off with the starter 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.479
 the riot police 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.879
 ever the newspaper 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.259
 I have 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.389
 beh 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
 but 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.749
 on the articles 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 that's right 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.579
 the pilot of the word for our loyal viewers 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.089
 for the parents 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.319
 the report
