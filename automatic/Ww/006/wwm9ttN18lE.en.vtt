00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.030 
it the ice cubes aren't in it

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.780 
it the ice cubes aren't in it
so<00:00:31.570> we'll<00:00:32.379> have<00:00:32.500> more<00:00:32.770> room<00:00:33.040> for<00:00:33.070> our<00:00:33.340> drinks

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
so we'll have more room for our drinks

so we'll have more room for our drinks
so<00:00:34.059> we're<00:00:34.540> gonna<00:00:34.629> be<00:00:34.840> using<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:35.170> mountain<00:00:35.500> Dew

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
so we're gonna be using a mountain Dew

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.010 
so we're gonna be using a mountain Dew
voltage<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.370> then<00:00:37.090> I<00:00:37.330> gotta<00:00:37.629> go<00:00:37.809> in<00:00:37.930> the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
voltage and then I gotta go in the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.770 
voltage and then I gotta go in the
freezer<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.650> get<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.280> outrageously<00:00:40.059> red<00:00:40.449> cup

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780

freezer and get the outrageously red cup
we<00:00:40.989> have<00:00:41.170> alright<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.309> we've<00:00:42.550> got<00:00:42.760> our

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
we have alright so we've got our

we have alright so we've got our
Mountain<00:00:43.300> Dew<00:00:43.420> voltage<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:44.080> we're<00:00:44.260> gonna<00:00:44.350> be

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
Mountain Dew voltage that we're gonna be

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.030 
Mountain Dew voltage that we're gonna be
using<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.250> then<00:00:46.060> we<00:00:46.390> have<00:00:46.660> our<00:00:47.079> cup<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.800> it's

using and then we have our cup and it's

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.010 
using and then we have our cup and it's
already<00:00:48.520> frozen<00:00:49.060> I<00:00:49.149> don't<00:00:49.360> believe<00:00:49.630> I<00:00:49.780> see<00:00:49.989> a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
already frozen I don't believe I see a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.810 
already frozen I don't believe I see a
fill<00:00:50.380> line<00:00:50.590> but<00:00:50.860> I'm<00:00:50.980> guessing<00:00:51.309> you're

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
fill line but I'm guessing you're

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.940 
fill line but I'm guessing you're
probably<00:00:52.420> gonna<00:00:52.690> want<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.170> like<00:00:53.350> do<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.559> just

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
that we're doing the mountain Dew

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.800 
that we're doing the mountain Dew
voltage<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.990> know<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:27.810> probably

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
voltage and you know just probably

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.840 
voltage and you know just probably
should<00:01:28.960> be<00:01:29.049> careful<00:01:29.500> with<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.610> says

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
should be careful with this so it says

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.550 
should be careful with this so it says
in<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.150> directions<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.960> you're<00:01:35.140> gonna<00:01:35.260> want

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
in the directions that you're gonna want

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.260 
in the directions that you're gonna want
to<00:01:35.619> put<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.159> bottom<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.970> like

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
to put it in the bottom like this like

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.609 
to put it in the bottom like this like
it's<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.510> little<00:01:37.630> hula<00:01:38.049> hoop<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:38.530> you

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
it's a little hula hoop and then you

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.679 
it's a little hula hoop and then you
connect<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.100> like<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.090> then<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> just

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
connect it like this and then you just

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.590 
connect it like this and then you just
pull<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.350> up<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.909> you're<00:01:43.060> gonna<00:01:43.180> want<00:01:43.509> to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
pull it up and now you're gonna want to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.080 
pull it up and now you're gonna want to
put<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.110> top<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.619> so<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.490> just<00:01:45.759> goes<00:01:45.939> on

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
put the top on so it just goes on

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.740 
put the top on so it just goes on
regularly<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.320> then<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.310> put<00:01:49.299> them<00:01:49.509> both

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
regularly and then you put them both

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.100 
regularly and then you put them both
together<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:51.250> probably<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.360> best<00:01:52.600> part<00:01:52.990> of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
together it's probably the best part of

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.410 
together it's probably the best part of
it<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.860> gonna<00:01:53.979> be<00:01:54.220> maybe<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.060> reason

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it and this is gonna be maybe the reason

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.240 
it and this is gonna be maybe the reason
that<00:01:55.509> any<00:01:55.720> kid<00:01:55.930> would<00:01:56.140> want<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.409> buy<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.590> it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that any kid would want to buy this it's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.600 
that any kid would want to buy this it's
just<00:01:57.460> time<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.700> squeeze<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.329> all

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.219 

alright<00:02:06.610> now<00:02:07.000> let's<00:02:07.210> take<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.540> off<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.020> try

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
alright now let's take this off and try

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.260 
alright now let's take this off and try
the<00:02:08.289> products<00:02:13.380> alright<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.460> came<00:02:15.610> out<00:02:15.670> very

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
the products alright so it came out very

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.880 
the products alright so it came out very
well<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.840> let's<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.230> try<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:19.890> missed

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
well now let's just try it and I missed

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.840 
well now let's just try it and I missed
all<00:02:21.130> right<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:23.470> took<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.950> shot<00:02:24.160> like<00:02:24.400> Kobe

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
all right I just took a shot like Kobe
