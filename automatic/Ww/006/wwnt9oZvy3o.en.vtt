in<00:00:02.560> this<00:00:03.490> short<00:00:03.820> instructional<00:00:04.029> video<00:00:04.600> I'm

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:05.439 
in this short instructional video I'm

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.720 
in this short instructional video I'm
going<00:00:05.649> to<00:00:05.740> be<00:00:05.859> showing<00:00:06.040> you<00:00:06.250> how<00:00:06.399> to<00:00:06.430> take<00:00:06.700> a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
going to be showing you how to take a

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.080 
going to be showing you how to take a
bearing<00:00:07.029> and<00:00:07.330> how<00:00:07.930> to<00:00:07.990> walk<00:00:08.350> on<00:00:08.530> a<00:00:08.590> bearing<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
bearing and how to walk on a bearing you

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.509 
bearing and how to walk on a bearing you
may<00:00:10.270> want<00:00:10.510> to<00:00:10.570> use<00:00:10.929> a<00:00:11.260> bearing<00:00:11.650> if<00:00:12.070> you<00:00:12.280> can't

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
may want to use a bearing if you can't

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.790 
may want to use a bearing if you can't
see<00:00:12.760> your<00:00:12.910> end<00:00:13.090> destination<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.530> could

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
see your end destination this could

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.220 
see your end destination this could
happen<00:00:14.950> if<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:15.340> weather<00:00:15.519> is<00:00:15.610> bad<00:00:15.759> or<00:00:16.299> if<00:00:16.930> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
happen if the weather is bad or if the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.480 
happen if the weather is bad or if the
feature<00:00:17.470> that<00:00:17.590> you're<00:00:17.710> trying<00:00:17.950> to<00:00:18.040> get<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.369> is

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
feature that you're trying to get to is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.939 
feature that you're trying to get to is
just<00:00:18.640> out<00:00:18.850> of<00:00:19.029> sight<00:00:19.270> you<00:00:20.230> can<00:00:20.380> then<00:00:20.560> use<00:00:20.800> the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
just out of sight you can then use the

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.950 
just out of sight you can then use the
compass<00:00:21.310> bearing<00:00:21.699> to<00:00:21.820> join<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.210> dots<00:00:22.420> from

this<00:00:49.270> example<00:00:49.870> we're<00:00:50.829> going<00:00:51.039> to<00:00:51.129> be<00:00:51.250> traveling

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
this example we're going to be traveling

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.510 
this example we're going to be traveling
from<00:00:51.940> SIL<00:00:52.360> Shane<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:53.079> mu<00:00:53.230> Bane<00:00:53.500> which<00:00:54.309> is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
from SIL Shane to mu Bane which is

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.340 
from SIL Shane to mu Bane which is
somewhere<00:00:54.910> between<00:00:54.969> north<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.140> east

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
somewhere between north and east

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.180 
somewhere between north and east
probably<00:00:57.340> about<00:00:57.520> forty<00:00:57.969> five<00:00:58.149> degrees<00:00:59.010> if<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
probably about forty five degrees if the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.979 
probably about forty five degrees if the
day<00:01:00.370> was<00:01:00.399> clear<00:01:00.879> we'd<00:01:01.120> be<00:01:01.270> able<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.510> set<00:01:01.780> our

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
day was clear we'd be able to set our

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.119 
day was clear we'd be able to set our
maps<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.500> head<00:01:02.620> off<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.070> direction

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
maps and head off in that direction

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.340 
maps and head off in that direction
using<00:01:03.820> good<00:01:04.479> visibility

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
using good visibility

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.410 
using good visibility
the<00:01:05.979> weather's<00:01:06.310> poor<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.939> can<00:01:07.119> use<00:01:07.270> our

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the weather's poor we can use our

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.410 
the weather's poor we can use our
compass<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.990> measure<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.470> angle<00:01:08.740> exactly<00:01:09.580> so

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
compass to measure that angle exactly so

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.140 
compass to measure that angle exactly so
in<00:01:10.540> this<00:01:10.720> example<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:12.010> want<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.280> travel<00:01:12.700> from<00:01:12.939> A

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
in this example we want to travel from A

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.700 
in this example we want to travel from A
to<00:01:13.510> B<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.270> use<00:01:16.510> our<00:01:16.689> compass<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.290> line<00:01:17.500> up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
to B we can use our compass to line up

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.039 
to B we can use our compass to line up
those<00:01:17.979> two<00:01:18.040> points<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.360> important<00:01:19.960> that

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
those two points and it's important that

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.440 
those two points and it's important that
you're<00:01:20.380> pointing<00:01:20.979> from<00:01:21.189> A<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.520> B<00:01:21.850> just<00:01:22.030> where

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
you're pointing from A to B just where

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.570 
you're pointing from A to B just where
my<00:01:22.570> finger<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:22.990> there's<00:01:23.409> an<00:01:23.500> arrow<00:01:23.710> that's<00:01:24.369> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
my finger is there's an arrow that's the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.399 
my finger is there's an arrow that's the
direction<00:01:24.820> I'm<00:01:25.180> traveling<00:01:25.720> in<00:01:28.259> hold<00:01:29.259> the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
direction I'm traveling in hold the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.080 
direction I'm traveling in hold the
compass<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.310> turn<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.210> dial<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.850> line

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
compass down and turn the dial to line

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.170 
compass down and turn the dial to line
up<00:01:34.360> with<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.320> grid<00:01:35.470> lines<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.759> can<00:01:36.850> see

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
up with the grid lines so you can see

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.270 
up with the grid lines so you can see
the<00:01:37.329> blue<00:01:37.540> grid<00:01:37.810> line<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.259> parallel<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the blue grid line is parallel to the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.719 
the blue grid line is parallel to the
red<00:01:39.460> arrow<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.509> compass<00:01:40.689> dial<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:42.610> are

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
red arrow on the compass dial there are

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.539 
red arrow on the compass dial there are
three<00:01:43.000> North's<00:01:43.450> grid<00:01:44.259> North<00:01:44.530> which<00:01:45.159> is<00:01:45.340> from

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
North Pole sits a magnetic north which

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.100 
North Pole sits a magnetic north which
is<00:01:51.700> what<00:01:51.909> controls<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.570> needle<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:52.960> our
