00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.600
 v 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.430
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.970
 I present a new fashion idea today 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 you also before the murder before the rails 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:32.009
 this mod adds these rails here 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.290
 and had to be moved so what what should I 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.350
 say here these rails are on everyone 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.960
 So, let's take a look at the moment 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 Now that's the beginning of me down here you see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.710
 ever added something new 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.530
 is used by the world through the mod 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.039
 example here 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:01.039
 this thing here this means are so 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.980
 you can cross the rails 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.730
 that would be the normal one 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.220
 go straight ahead here this bouncer 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.140
 and buy 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 These curves really stop a bit 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.080
 so and it may indeed briefly show the times 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 you go right now so you do not have to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 track different as here but it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.880
 is a bow immediately and 2 I have 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 that's gonna work out now, too 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.070
 but then there are these 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.310
 soft here but I have here now 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.649
 ever set up a small course and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 yes we must not forget that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.820
 now also important this thing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 you need for your soft ones 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.790
 white of the train travels straight ahead 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.790
 and just the train 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 good but these rails are just a stop 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:07.370
 a little bit different can be very short 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.950
 So you take the normal rail 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.900
 can not 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 you can not use your my cards or something 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.300
 So continue on this track make it 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.490
 is really only with this train the the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.990
 mod is 30 percent that is it 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:28.850
 so new things will be added 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:30.070
 come and then I would say drove 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.709
 Let's do a round 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.880
 what you need to drive is where 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.200
 it then used coal and once again 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.910
 you need the free space in the inventory 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.360
 what you can not give us a stone rich 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.160
 Right click to get in and then skin 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.840
 he cleans the coal and you can see that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.500
 Upstairs from the chimney smokes house 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.080
 is important is still here in the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.920
 options you have to scroll down completely 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.519
 here you have these three things so me 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.799
 I push it up and up first 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.209
 down arrow keys and if i'm using now 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.709
 The arrow keys go up then 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.090
 the train starts 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.030
 I hope that fits through the now 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.640
 tunnel through which I have until 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.030
 maybe added later 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:25.180
 slowly, slowly 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.180
 so we can get off for a moment 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.840
 now it is here so I have to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.220
 very fast malta press on us 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.220
 he drives namely to the right 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.599
 Now we come to the soft here you 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.060
 Look, I used red wool here 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.650
 and here I want red wool now 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.959
 not one hundred percent sure if that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.190
 really necessary but i guess 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.190
 because it did not work 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.040
 quite easy to remember here these bars 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.019
 the here see exactly must include these 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.030
 red wool and here must the red wool 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:08.069
 then he hits this one up here 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:11.959
 What is his name for the winter and winter? 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.879
 then you can just put the soft 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.190
 I 've already tried that without annoying 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.940
 now completely along here 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.380
 put it did not work with 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.810
 looked at a picture and there it was 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:34.169
 on it and lo and behold it has 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:37.349
 works actually that's it 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:42.180
 so on the whole must the 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:44.460
 Train in the tunnel should let us now 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.780
 drive through the soft again and again 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.539
 then I'll show you how to get the courage 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.470
 installed the mod I installed 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.470
 I will not get used to it 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.330
 were quick as the installation 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:11.210
 In any case, it will be pretty much afterwards 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:11.210
 just a little bit faster 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.280
 so and now he travels here over here 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.210
 I also have this one in front 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.210
 strange thing in there 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.840
 the only thing I noticed now 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.310
 hat was probably not yet it works 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.770
 I do not know if I have something 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:48.410
 did wrong or so but if 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:50.930
 I'm going to get it up now 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.030
 I would like to build before 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.790
 Tried that did not work for me 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.670
 I do not know if that works now 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:05.540
 I'm still fixated, I hope so because of that 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:08.180
 yes the salt already somewhere it will be 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.180
 already decisive we or it would be up 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:17.870
 any case better because it is so 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:23.090
 a bit weird but I mean fine 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.980
 looks and definitely can 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.380
 So maybe your minecraft world maybe 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.660
 make it a little more mobile 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.810
 couple of tunnels dig from a house to 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.820
 other or on top or as well 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.280
 always 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.290
 and can be nice with this sign 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.760
 through the area was good I'll show you 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:46.310
 quick as always the courage and 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.290
 the mod installed as well as said the 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.880
 installation is relatively easy 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.740
 you just have to have this one video from 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.200
 I look at the bottom of the 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.190
 description or me for left easy 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:04.070
 here in the video once that minecraft 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:07.820
 forge 1.652 installation video there 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.850
 I explain to you as you forge 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.350
 installed and the rest is actually 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:18.580
 Relatively simple you just have to 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.580
 in your minecraft folder 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.780
 and first of all, you have to first 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.640
 times a mod download and the mod 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.770
 download and then you go to your 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:38.340
 minecraft folder and pulls the whole 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:40.260
 just in the folder purely and that 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.310
 it was you can start you can with 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.810
 the courage fun with which you have fun 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.610
 i hope i could help you me 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.350
 Hope you liked the video 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.700
 as always if you wish or 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.530
 have questions write a comment 

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.720
 Of course you are welcome to come too 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.520
 letting it go well then i would say 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.600
 until next time makes it good and 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.600
 switch back on a job
