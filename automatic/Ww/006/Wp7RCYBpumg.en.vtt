so guys I got the WP 40 in the tank so I
got<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> WP<00:00:12.960> 40<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.710> new<00:00:14.099> tank<00:00:14.400> right<00:00:14.670> now

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
got the WP 40 in the new tank right now

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.420 
got the WP 40 in the new tank right now
it's<00:00:15.540> right<00:00:15.719> there<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> back<00:00:16.289> corner<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it's right there in the back corner and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
it's right there in the back corner and
I<00:00:18.270> really<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.810> position<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.590> been

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
I really like that position I've been

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.090 
I really like that position I've been
playing<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> wave<00:00:20.490> modes<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:21.949> little<00:00:22.949> bit

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
playing with the wave modes a little bit

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.170 
playing with the wave modes a little bit
just<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> does<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.900> tank<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
just to see what it does in the tank and

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.759 
just to see what it does in the tank and
basically<00:00:27.180> test<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> integrity<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.680> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
basically test the integrity of this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.530 
basically test the integrity of this
tank<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:30.260> here

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
tank out here

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.270 
tank out here
so<00:00:33.540> anyways<00:00:33.840> basically<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.620> help<00:00:34.800> test<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so anyways basically to help test the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.780 
so anyways basically to help test the
integrity<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.030> tank<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.219> by

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
integrity of this tank you know by

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
integrity of this tank you know by
slopping<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> water<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.200> right<00:00:40.320> now

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
slopping this water around so right now

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.680 
slopping this water around so right now
it's<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.980> high<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:42.239> gonna<00:00:42.360> turn<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it's just on high I'm gonna turn it on

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's just on high I'm gonna turn it on
the<00:00:42.809> wave<00:00:42.989> modes<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.100> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the wave modes and see what we get going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:56.049 
the wave modes and see what we get going
on<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.719> wave<00:00:54.930> mode<00:00:55.199> one

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
on here so there it is on wave mode one

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.880 
on here so there it is on wave mode one
again<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.210> isn't<00:00:57.420> shooting<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.680> from

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
again this isn't shooting you know from

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
again this isn't shooting you know from
one<00:00:59.039> end<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> tank<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> other<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
one end of the tank to the other it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
one end of the tank to the other it's
just<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.539> shooting<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.920> corner

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
just kind of shooting from that corner

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
just kind of shooting from that corner
diagonally<00:01:02.609> across<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.510> tank<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:05.040> gets

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
diagonally across the tank and it gets

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.760 
diagonally across the tank and it gets
this<00:01:05.339> tank<00:01:05.610> moving<00:01:05.790> pretty<00:01:06.060> well<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> had

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this tank moving pretty well when I had

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
this tank moving pretty well when I had
it<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> middle<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:09.420> wall

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it on in the middle of the side wall

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
it on in the middle of the side wall
there<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.710> whole<00:01:10.920> tank<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.430> sloshing<00:01:11.880> back

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
there this whole tank was sloshing back

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
there this whole tank was sloshing back
and<00:01:12.270> forth<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> had<00:01:13.799> a

and forth really and really good I had a
good<00:01:14.040> three<00:01:14.490> inch<00:01:14.670> standing<00:01:15.090> wave<00:01:15.210> easy<00:01:18.500> so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
good three inch standing wave easy so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.660 
good three inch standing wave easy so
yeah<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.860> again<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.689> 1g<00:01:21.689> bow<00:01:22.670> WP

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
yeah this is again this is a 1g bow WP

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.980 
yeah this is again this is a 1g bow WP
40

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.100 

I<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.270> motion<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.540> get<00:01:34.720> out<00:01:34.870> of<00:01:34.900> this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
I like the motion I get out of this

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.070 
I like the motion I get out of this
that's<00:01:35.500> good<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.180> what<00:01:37.270> I'll<00:01:37.360> do<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.570> I'll<00:01:37.870> put

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
that's good so what I'll do is I'll put

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.890 
that's good so what I'll do is I'll put
the<00:01:38.260> WP<00:01:39.010> 40<00:01:39.400> on<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:40.090> part<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> glass<00:01:40.630> here

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
the WP 40 on just part of the glass here

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.240 
the WP 40 on just part of the glass here
and<00:01:40.930> see<00:01:41.110> if<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.230> can't<00:01:41.440> get<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.680> wave<00:01:41.860> going

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
and see if we can't get that wave going

00:01:42.250 --> 00:02:22.070 
and see if we can't get that wave going
again

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:31.550 

just<00:02:22.620> gotta<00:02:22.830> clean<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> game<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.640> bit

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.520 

it<00:02:31.920> takes<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.250> little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.640> Stinky's<00:02:33.180> wide<00:02:33.530> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it takes a little bit Stinky's wide so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.840 
it takes a little bit Stinky's wide so
it<00:02:34.650> takes<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> little<00:02:35.070> bit<00:02:35.280> longer<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.610> this

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
it takes a little bit longer for this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.090 
it takes a little bit longer for this
pump<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.240> get<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.510> rocking<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:37.260> opposed<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.830> two

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
pump to get it rocking as opposed to two

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.730 
pump to get it rocking as opposed to two

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.410 
foot or 18 inch 24 inch 18 inch tank I
remember<00:02:43.740> we<00:02:43.860> got<00:02:43.890> my<00:02:44.130> 220<00:02:44.730> rock<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> really

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
remember we got my 220 rock and really

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.020 
remember we got my 220 rock and really
quick<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:47.070> takes<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.520> little<00:02:47.550> bit<00:02:47.880> more

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
quick it takes just a little bit more

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:58.370 
quick it takes just a little bit more
time<00:02:48.270> because<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.900> depth<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.800> panic

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.350 

and<00:02:58.920> finding<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.340> happy<00:02:59.640> place<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.270> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and finding that happy place on the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:17.790 
and finding that happy place on the
controller

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.670
