said was on and she did admit that they

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.570 
said was on and she did admit that they
realized<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.769> there<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> glitch<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
realized that there was a glitch in the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.229 
realized that there was a glitch in the
system<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> who<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.760> those<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.150> who

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
system and so who for those of you who

system and so who for those of you who
think<00:02:36.269> you're<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.230> get<00:02:37.319> another

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
think you're going to go and get another

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.280 
think you're going to go and get another
coupon<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.519> then<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:38.940> 10<00:02:39.420> more<00:02:39.630> prints<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.040 
coupon and then get 10 more prints and
not<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.489> happen<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.480> she<00:02:42.540> said<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> only

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
not going to happen so she said the only

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.290 
not going to happen so she said the only
way<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.410> get<00:02:43.500> around<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.550> wait

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
way you can get around that is to wait

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.890 
way you can get around that is to wait
until<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.870> next<00:02:46.140> quarter<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.700> coupons<00:02:48.150> reset

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
until the next quarter the coupons reset

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.170 
until the next quarter the coupons reset
every<00:02:49.530> quarter<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> next<00:02:50.519> quarter<00:02:51.060> would

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
every quarter so the next quarter would

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.259 
every quarter so the next quarter would
be<00:02:51.390> after<00:02:51.600> January<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> first<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.880> she<00:02:54.060> said

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
be after January the first and she said

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.440 
be after January the first and she said
at<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.569> time<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.290> purchase<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> new

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
at that time if you purchase a new

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.130 
at that time if you purchase a new
cereal<00:02:57.450> coupon<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.830> will<00:02:59.010> let<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.430> print

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
cereal coupon then it will let you print

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.080 
cereal coupon then it will let you print
the<00:03:01.140> required<00:03:01.530> amount<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.040> I'm<00:03:02.190> assuming<00:03:02.640> at

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the required amount and I'm assuming at

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.440 
the required amount and I'm assuming at
that<00:03:03.810> point<00:03:04.140> they're<00:03:04.349> going<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.739> they're

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that point they're going to they're

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.910 
that point they're going to they're
probably<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.780> fixed<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> glitch<00:03:07.440> since

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
probably have fixed the glitch since

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.680 
probably have fixed the glitch since
they're<00:03:08.099> aware<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.450> therefore

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
they're aware of it and so therefore

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
they're aware of it and so therefore
you're<00:03:10.080> probably<00:03:10.319> only<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.620> able<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you're probably only be able to get to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.270 
you're probably only be able to get to
so<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.750> they're<00:03:12.959> aware<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.739> were<00:03:13.769> getting

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
so so they're aware that we were getting

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.130 
so so they're aware that we were getting
multiple<00:03:14.730> prints<00:03:15.090> off<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.269> those<00:03:15.510> links<00:03:15.989> all

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
multiple prints off of those links all

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.099 
multiple prints off of those links all
right<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:17.069> I'm<00:03:17.400> anyway<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:17.820> she<00:03:18.030> credited<00:03:18.930> me

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
right so I'm anyway so she credited me

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.130 
right so I'm anyway so she credited me
back<00:03:19.350> my<00:03:19.650> thousand<00:03:20.340> points<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> said

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
back my thousand points and like I said

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.810 
back my thousand points and like I said
she<00:03:22.620> said<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.160> ahead<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.489> wait<00:03:23.640> until

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
she said to go ahead and wait until

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.330 
she said to go ahead and wait until
after<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.750> new<00:03:24.930> quarter<00:03:25.410> which<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.160> in
