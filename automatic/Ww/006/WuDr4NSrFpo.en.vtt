00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello welcome to coconut 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.300
 today have a do it for yourself 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.300
 you i'm going to comic me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 you need a fabric I have chosen 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.160
 for a simple red you dust it 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 hair clips and you can buy these at 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 etos for 51 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 you only need one if 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 your body how terrible you want 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.930
 make and measuring tape 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.239
 or a ruler and pin 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.239
 just such games 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.239
 scissors I use a dust scissors 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 because that is the best for the fabric and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.109
 and I have unfolded my fabric 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.000
 and now I'm going to mark a rectangle of 20 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:07.350
 centimeters by 15 centimeters so at the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 20 I just put it and pin look like that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:20.420
 wait 20 and then I put here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.420
 the toy in this way 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.930
 from the 20 I measure 15 and also at 15 move 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.930
 I have a pin 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.580
 I also have 15 centimeters from the beginning 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 measured 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.010
 now I have all of my badges on 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.570
 extra 9 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.570
 then it's time to cut 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.010
 you cut along the melting gravy I have to 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:05.290
 on the outside 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:08.940
 and it doesn't have to be very precise then yes 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.940
 I now have this folder 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.050
 the glue gun is now warming up 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.970
 so be very careful with that and 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.970
 definitely do not apply this 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.290
 I feel my shock a little too wide so me 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 have these two sides just a 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 random piece removed ok you grab 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.090
 glue gun 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.390
 and then you go to this edge 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.820
 just about the centimeter from the edge 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.820
 off you go outside 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.640
 then you have to put your piss over you whole 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.890
 be careful this also dries whole 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:10.890
 quickly up so very hot 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:13.079
 and then you fold this inside this is 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 really hot 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.650
 so watch out 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.459
 this fauser inside and well you just get you 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.380
 party up until it has dried up 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.500
 and you do this on all sides 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.840
 your package and you go a double 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.080
 then fold over 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.180
 this line because when you open it again 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.610
 fold then I see here 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.810
 the line and then you know it must ready 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:47.330
 gluing of I spray glue on the now single 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.330
 half of the hands here 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 and then if i do this this i go now 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.000
 spray it up 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.599
 and then I fold my piece in half on the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.599
 line 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.930
 and then you have this 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.830
 I now lead this together in the middle 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.949
 so and then grab your pin 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.919
 and this around it to just as fast 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.930
 then I just have a small strip 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.300
 cut out 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:49.539
 of the fabric and there I go glue mouth 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.539
 lubricate 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:09.539
 a one now I quickly grab this 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.490
 and take this off and take it whole 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.490
 careful my patch 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.669
 and then I fill it up here 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.410
 then I have this now and I think it's whole 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.330
 really nice now a bow 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.890
 all we have to do now is it 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.290
 to stick on the pin 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.890
 ok i put my fright so that that on 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.470
 the wrong side is so this is the 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.380
 good side and that is so on 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.730
 europe and this is the wrong side then i go 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:02.390
 with the glue gun that smeg grabbed 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:06.320
 here in the middle smearing some glue, and 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:14.030
 then I grab the pin and lay with the 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:16.900
 top on the bow 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.900
 this should now dry 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:29.189
 so I leave it back for a while 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.360
 this is the end result i like 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.509
 have become really nice 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.309
