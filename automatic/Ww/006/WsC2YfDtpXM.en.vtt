more stability and balance which in turn

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050 
more stability and balance which in turn

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
gives it more stamina and you can see

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
stamina because of how is the almost

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.170 
stamina because of how is the almost
complete<00:07:03.259> circle<00:07:04.099> with<00:07:04.520> just<00:07:04.759> these<00:07:04.880> little

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
complete circle with just these little

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.409 
complete circle with just these little
notches<00:07:05.919> but<00:07:06.919> there<00:07:07.039> really<00:07:07.160> isn't<00:07:07.520> much<00:07:07.970> to

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
notches but there really isn't much to

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.659 
notches but there really isn't much to
hit<00:07:08.539> in<00:07:08.660> there<00:07:08.840> because<00:07:08.960> you<00:07:09.710> can't<00:07:09.979> really<00:07:10.280> I

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
hit in there because you can't really I

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.020 
hit in there because you can't really I
mean<00:07:11.270> those<00:07:11.479> notches<00:07:11.780> have<00:07:12.289> a<00:07:12.320> very<00:07:13.070> small

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
mean those notches have a very small

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.270 
mean those notches have a very small
space<00:07:14.470> it's<00:07:15.470> a<00:07:15.530> really<00:07:15.650> a<00:07:15.770> very<00:07:15.919> small<00:07:16.159> space

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
space it's a really a very small space

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.790 
space it's a really a very small space
so<00:07:17.270> you<00:07:17.360> couldn't<00:07:17.750> get<00:07:17.900> anything<00:07:18.139> cuts<00:07:18.440> within

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
so you couldn't get anything cuts within

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.460 
so you couldn't get anything cuts within
him<00:07:19.009> and<00:07:19.750> so<00:07:20.750> it<00:07:21.110> is<00:07:21.289> a<00:07:21.349> good<00:07:21.560> beyblade<00:07:23.380> and<00:07:24.380> a

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
him and so it is a good beyblade and a

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.129 
him and so it is a good beyblade and a
very<00:07:24.770> good<00:07:24.860> stamina<00:07:25.400> type<00:07:26.139> definitely
