00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 this test going from 4 to 5 level in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.919
 the french branch we get pretty 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 strange tank he's even a tank then his 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.950
 hard to call it most likely pt 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 fast shifty 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 and hiding in the bushes but this tank 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 has a wonderful gun caliber 90 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 millimeters which can pierce everything 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 what year are players at their level 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 disagree with me so few 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 dozens of battles players will say what's on it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 you can not only play tihushku from under 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 bushes but you can play 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 aggressively 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 before the tree ambiguous tank main 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.649
 Christmas tree function it will be a firefly on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 battlefields and so you even 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.360
 throws ninth level there are two 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.829
 options 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 drive through the whole map like mad 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 hare and flashing the enemy or go to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 the right point to get up in the bushes she 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.189
 highlighting the enemy and thus you 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.650
 provide invaluable help to their team 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.770
 masking and installing the necessary modules you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.450
 will become a ghost will be shocking because 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 what will have the lowest 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 stealth coefficient in this game 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 forget if somewhere near 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 opponents you stand side by side to wait and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 try to shoot 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.540
 you will immediately shine you will soon 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.390
 total destroyed 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.329
 400 units of strength will turn 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 absolutely dust 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.490
 sometimes tanks just stand 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 shoot out 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.130
 and have a high profile you can 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.490
 easy to use drove back 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.220
 part of the stern of the tank become and propping it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.299
 You can endlessly shoot, then he does not 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.579
 able to shoot you so his profile 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.310
 with a gun doesn't let him shoot at 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.130
 you are practically on 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.130
 le castel and I destroyed high level 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.720
 tanks 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.780
 this speed the tree is not able to dramatically 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520
 turn it will definitely go into a skid 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 but did control periodically 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.400
 releasing the gas key we thoroughly 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 know maps and terrain 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.480
 having dispersed a tank you will often 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.810
 jump and you will toss and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.430
 will lose the caterpillars 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 Mujica is constantly at some time 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.090
 kit they will save your life 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.459
 repeatedly has a mechanism 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.970
 drum loading it will only 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.970
 remix 12 is a tank of the sixth level 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.700
 very ambiguous gun she spoke 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.700
 best of its level 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.599
 beaver non-penetration and damage wine 100 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.599
 millimeters has a cyclic charge gun 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.470
 comes down and almost 3 seconds it 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.840
 is a big drawback very 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.030
 inconvenient to target opponents who 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.739
 are in motion not catastrophically 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.739
 grabs the corners of the horizontal guidance 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.859
 Combing the tank body 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 so you must calculate the trajectory 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:18.120
 tank movements and come down 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.569
 advance the right moment and produce 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 shot 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.650
 let's just see the fight 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.360
 foliage 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.670
 ridge 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.110
 More would like to say to the tree can not 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.440
 ram opponents she is very easy 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.440
 weight 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.450
 you was a sleigh max put the huskies 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:04.230
