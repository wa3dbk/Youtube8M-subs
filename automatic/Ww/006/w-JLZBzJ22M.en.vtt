the<00:01:41.700> sounds<00:01:42.150> were<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the sounds were a bit of a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.030 
the sounds were a bit of a
disappointment<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> gameplay<00:01:46.079> again<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
disappointment but the gameplay again is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.010

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
those those are pretty much the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.969 
those those are pretty much the
