00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
noticed and there was a lot of really

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
noticed and there was a lot of really
really<00:00:14.009> dramatic<00:00:14.400> changes<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.660> kill

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
really dramatic changes is that the kill

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.010 
really dramatic changes is that the kill
count<00:00:16.170> takes<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.130> much<00:00:17.279> longer<00:00:17.340> than<00:00:17.670> before

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
count takes so much longer than before

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.330 
count takes so much longer than before
all<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> monsters<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.220> even

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
all the monsters that you see like even

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040 
all the monsters that you see like even
though<00:00:20.609> even<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> goblins<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.539> around<00:00:21.750> level

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
though even the goblins are around level

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
though even the goblins are around level
120<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:23.760> attacking

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
120 now so I was basically attacking

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
120 now so I was basically attacking
goblins<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.840> were<00:00:24.930> 120<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.590> orcs<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.070> were

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
goblins that were 120 and orcs that were

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
goblins that were 120 and orcs that were
level<00:00:26.430> 1<00:00:26.580> 30<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> entire<00:00:27.300> time<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> kill

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
level 1 30 the entire time so the kill

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.599 
level 1 30 the entire time so the kill
count<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.830> me<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.400> took

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
count for me to get in here took

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
count for me to get in here took
literally<00:00:29.910> 20<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> 30<00:00:30.599> minutes<00:00:30.810> which<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.109> kind

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
literally 20 to 30 minutes which is kind

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.459 
literally 20 to 30 minutes which is kind
of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> pain<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.059> once<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.630> pretty

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
of a pain and once I got in there pretty

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.569 
of a pain and once I got in there pretty
much<00:00:34.590> every<00:00:34.829> world<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.430> was

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
much every world as you can see was

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
much every world as you can see was
completely<00:00:36.120> mobbed<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:37.260> took<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> while<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
completely mobbed it took me a while to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
completely mobbed it took me a while to
actually<00:00:38.210> find<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.360> world<00:00:40.020> where<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.320> able

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
actually find a world where I was able

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
actually find a world where I was able
to<00:00:40.590> solo<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.059> little

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to solo or do it you could see a little

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.369 
to solo or do it you could see a little
bit<00:00:42.360> towards<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> middle<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> video

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
bit towards the middle of the video

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.729 
bit towards the middle of the video
where<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:44.250> able<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.789> um<00:00:45.710> one<00:00:46.710> thing

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
where I'm able to do that um one thing

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
where I'm able to do that um one thing
that<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.340> did<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that I really did not like and it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
that I really did not like and it
confused<00:00:48.780> me<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> logic<00:00:49.829> behind<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
confused me as the logic behind it is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.420 
confused me as the logic behind it is
that<00:00:50.879> gray<00:00:51.539> door<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.110> level<00:00:52.530> 170<00:00:53.280> as

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that gray door is now level 170 as

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.330 
that gray door is now level 170 as
opposed<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.989> he<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.230> mid<00:00:56.129> five

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
opposed to I think he was mid five

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
opposed to I think he was mid five
hundreds<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.789> low<00:00:56.940> 600<00:00:57.390> before<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:58.469> really

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
hundreds of low 600 before not really

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
hundreds of low 600 before not really
sure<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> reasoning<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.789> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sure what the reasoning for that is it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
sure what the reasoning for that is it
seems<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> lot<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.440> higher

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
seems like they put a lot of the higher

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
seems like they put a lot of the higher
tier<00:01:02.100> monsters<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.760> level<00:01:03.030> 1<00:01:03.120> 79<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
tier monsters at level 1 79 I think I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.670 
tier monsters at level 1 79 I think I
think<00:01:04.769> jad<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.250> also<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:06.000> level<00:01:06.930> 1<00:01:07.080> 70<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.560> not

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
think jad is also at level 1 70 I'm not

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
think jad is also at level 1 70 I'm not
a<00:01:07.710> hundred<00:01:07.890> percent<00:01:08.060> but<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
a hundred percent but then you have a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
a hundred percent but then you have a
you<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.200> graders<00:01:10.680> minions<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.369> like

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you have graders minions you have like

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
you have graders minions you have like
Sergeant<00:01:11.970> Grimm<00:01:12.150> spikes<00:01:12.420> level<00:01:12.750> 1<00:01:12.840> 42<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
Sergeant Grimm spikes level 1 42 and the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
Sergeant Grimm spikes level 1 42 and the
difference<00:01:14.850> between<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.840> difference

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
difference between the difference

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.320 
difference between the difference
between<00:01:16.229> grey<00:01:16.680> dawn<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> his<00:01:17.790> minions<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
between grey dawn and his minions is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
between grey dawn and his minions is
pretty<00:01:18.840> dramatic<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.470> understand<00:01:19.830> why

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
pretty dramatic I don't understand why

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.020 
pretty dramatic I don't understand why
there<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.159> only<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> level<00:01:20.729> 28

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there would only be a level 28

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.870 
there would only be a level 28
difference<00:01:21.479> between<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.430> anyways<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
difference between them but anyways you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
difference between them but anyways you
can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.210> throughout<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> video<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.770> chaotic

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

video<00:03:34.230> where<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> fully<00:03:34.829> explain<00:03:35.160> how<00:03:35.310> much<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
video where I fully explain how much the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.819 
video where I fully explain how much the
healing<00:03:36.180> has<00:03:36.269> changed<00:03:36.600> sabras<00:03:37.590> are<00:03:37.709> not

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
healing has changed sabras are not

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.340 
healing has changed sabras are not
really<00:03:38.040> worth<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.430> anymore<00:03:38.570> each<00:03:39.570> brudos<00:03:40.019> only

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
really worth it anymore each brudos only

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.470 
really worth it anymore each brudos only
heals<00:03:40.500> 500<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> flask<00:03:42.030> you'd<00:03:42.299> get<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
heals 500 so with a flask you'd get a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.890 
heals 500 so with a flask you'd get a
full<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> full<00:03:43.470> heel<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.859> 3000<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:45.720> kind

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
full a full heel of 3000 and it's kind

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.180 
full a full heel of 3000 and it's kind
of<00:03:45.959> inefficient<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.769> because<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.100> have

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
of inefficient you know because you have

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
to click in your ways game tix it would

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.319 
to click in your ways game tix it would
be<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.959> use<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.350> between<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:50.010> between

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
opponent like 10 12 times and if you

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.460 
opponent like 10 12 times and if you
read<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:44.970> description<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.599> says<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:46.380> will

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
read a description it says you will

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.320 
read a description it says you will
attack<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.950> opponent<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.789> know<00:05:47.910> every<00:05:48.180> two

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
attack the opponent you know every two

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.490 
attack the opponent you know every two
seconds<00:05:48.690> for<00:05:48.810> ten<00:05:48.990> seconds<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.380> will

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
seconds for ten seconds you will

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.980 
seconds for ten seconds you will
actually<00:05:49.620> hit<00:05:49.830> them<00:05:49.950> like<00:05:50.479> if<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.660> think

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
actually hit them like if I think

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.140 
actually hit them like if I think
they'll<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.410> like<00:05:52.560> five<00:05:52.800> damage<00:05:53.220> splats<00:05:53.490> but

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
they'll get like five damage splats but

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.790 
they'll get like five damage splats but
you'll<00:05:54.270> actually<00:05:54.419> swing<00:05:54.810> at<00:05:54.900> them<00:05:55.050> like<00:05:55.200> 12

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
you'll actually swing at them like 12

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.170 
you'll actually swing at them like 12
times<00:05:56.099> or<00:05:56.340> something<00:05:56.639> to<00:05:56.729> that<00:05:56.760> effect<00:05:57.120> and

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
times or something to that effect and

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.879 
times or something to that effect and
it's<00:05:57.810> kind<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.139> really<00:05:58.349> really<00:05:58.680> annoying

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
it's kind of really really annoying

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.920 
it's kind of really really annoying
because<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.340> feel<00:05:59.639> like<00:05:59.669> the<00:06:00.150> old<00:06:00.360> runescape

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
because I feel like the old runescape

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.010 
because I feel like the old runescape
you<00:06:01.590> could<00:06:01.830> really<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:03.030> know<00:06:03.120> it<00:06:03.210> was<00:06:03.360> the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
you could really you know it was the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.719 
you could really you know it was the
damage<00:06:04.260> splats<00:06:04.680> were<00:06:04.919> equal<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.400> what<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.610> do

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
damage splats were equal to what you do

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:06.980 
damage splats were equal to what you do
like<00:06:05.910> when<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.150> see<00:06:06.300> somebody<00:06:06.510> do<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.960> a

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
like when you see somebody do like a

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.020 
like when you see somebody do like a
dragon<00:06:07.470> dagger<00:06:07.620> spec<00:06:08.010> they'd<00:06:08.520> slash<00:06:08.880> across

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
dragon dagger spec they'd slash across

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.750 
dragon dagger spec they'd slash across
twice<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:10.650> get<00:06:10.860> to<00:06:11.010> damage<00:06:11.340> splats<00:06:11.610> and

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
twice and you get to damage splats and

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.070 
twice and you get to damage splats and
somebody<00:06:12.060> use<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.270> Dragon<00:06:12.570> Claw<00:06:12.690> suspect

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
somebody use the Dragon Claw suspect

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.110 
somebody use the Dragon Claw suspect
you'd<00:06:13.229> see<00:06:13.410> for<00:06:13.950> slashes<00:06:14.430> and<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.669> get<00:06:14.849> for

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
you'd see for slashes and you get for

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.300 
you'd see for slashes and you get for
damage<00:06:15.419> splats<00:06:15.690> so<00:06:16.560> that's<00:06:16.800> another<00:06:17.010> thing<00:06:17.190> I

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
damage splats so that's another thing I

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.650 
damage splats so that's another thing I
think<00:06:17.520> they<00:06:17.580> should<00:06:17.760> probably<00:06:18.060> work<00:06:18.240> on<00:06:18.450> as

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
think they should probably work on as

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.850 
think they should probably work on as
far<00:06:18.810> as<00:06:18.900> you<00:06:19.020> know<00:06:19.110> making<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.440> graphics

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
far as you know making the graphics

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.469 
far as you know making the graphics
really<00:06:20.130> apply<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.430> what's<00:06:21.360> actually

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
really apply to what's actually

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.050 
really apply to what's actually
occurring<00:06:21.780> in<00:06:22.139> the<00:06:22.200> game<00:06:22.520> but<00:06:23.520> overall<00:06:23.760> over

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
occurring in the game but overall over

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.980
