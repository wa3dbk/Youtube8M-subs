00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.929
 hi to all and bai 100 kg I hope that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.290
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.790
 nickel 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.759
 new video i'm going to give you two 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.570
 three small pieces of information 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.400
 additional on the update 1 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 points 13 so I had already done a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 video giving you most of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.960
 new options that would be 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.279
 so available in the dlc has life 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.869
 is actually a few small 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.519
 information that has occurred more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.500
 late so I'll show you that all 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.060
 right now 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.130
 so here he talks to me about neowin from Austin 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 so that will be the hues of the windows and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 there they tell us that there will be pure 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 black 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.469
 you can already reach your windows 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.879
 but I think it's up to 80% and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 there my opinion we could the colors and to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.489
 100% 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.290
 we go now to the second small 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.230
 novelty so all these novelties are 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 go to custom ls you will see 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.020
 then there he tells us about a new 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.370
 metallic paint so the paint 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 gold and lessard mona lisa will do 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 enjoy a lot of people at all 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.170
 the little tricks we try to do 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 go out to make you create 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.859
 gold paintings the haye will really be there 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.879
 and that will be the real one so we wait for a 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.140
 little see the result of this 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670
 painting to really see if that's the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 color 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 in any case I hope here speaks to us 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 two new tire smoke 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 so we will have the pink color and the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.510
 brown color so why not that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580
 could be quite a bit obscure besides 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.869
 you're not going to spit on it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.520
 and finally we will have new 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.810
 horn so there you want them to say 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 of re fa fa sol la so do so at 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 so it will be a new crash without 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 that's not going to spit on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.600
 we will wait to see what is it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 want and then we will judge then me 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.780
