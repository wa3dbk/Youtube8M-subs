like little straight tips a little bit

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.319 
like little straight tips a little bit
but<00:01:56.960> they're<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.759> string<00:01:59.759> G<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.149> they

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
but they're not as string G as they

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.450 
but they're not as string G as they
weren't<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> cut<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.649> up
