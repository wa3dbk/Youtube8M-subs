kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> drift<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.939> food

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
kind of drift off into just food

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.660

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
you can dip them to and take a little

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.999 
you can dip them to and take a little
chunk<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.320> opposed<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
chunk out of at a time as opposed to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
chunk out of at a time as opposed to
something<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> read<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.720> know

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
something you have to read from you know

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.999 
something you have to read from you know
from<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> beginning<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> end<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.829> don't

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
from the beginning to the end and don't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.380 
from the beginning to the end and don't
feel<00:01:29.159> satisfied<00:01:29.610> until<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> reach<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> end

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so is this a sort of a new path I guess

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
so is this a sort of a new path I guess
for<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.680> terms<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.009> writing<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> we're

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
going to see ya I think that genre more

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
going to see ya I think that genre more
yeah<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.009> um<00:01:38.280> food<00:01:38.909> literature<00:01:39.420> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
yeah I think so um food literature is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
yeah I think so um food literature is
very<00:01:39.900> popular<00:01:40.439> around<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.579> world<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
very popular around the world it's a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.590 
very popular around the world it's a
fairly<00:01:42.210> recent<00:01:43.939> change<00:01:44.939> i<00:01:45.090> guess<00:01:45.119> maybe<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
fairly recent change i guess maybe in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.289 
fairly recent change i guess maybe in
the<00:01:45.689> last<00:01:45.869> ten<00:01:46.110> years<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.590> become<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.520> lot

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
it's perspectives on food so that people

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.990 
it's perspectives on food so that people
would<00:03:40.500> know<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.040> not<00:03:41.580> just<00:03:41.820> about

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
