not like this is gonna be lighting up

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.009 
not like this is gonna be lighting up
the<00:02:42.650> street<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.159> can<00:02:43.340> see<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.569> think<00:02:44.930> it's

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
the street so I can see but I think it's

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.330 
the street so I can see but I think it's
just<00:02:45.079> a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.500> cool<00:02:45.709> thing<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.010> show<00:02:46.160> your

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
out take it out of the garage I'll show

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:51.250 
out take it out of the garage I'll show
them

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
them

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.759 
them
I'd<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.739> hey<00:02:51.859> check<00:02:52.099> this<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:53.239> know

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769

I'd be like hey check this out you know
so<00:02:54.769> uh<00:02:54.799> there's<00:02:55.489> actually<00:02:55.849> three<00:02:56.060> modes<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
so uh there's actually three modes to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.240 
so uh there's actually three modes to
this<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.489> actually<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.239> second<00:02:59.599> mode

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
this this is actually the second mode

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.770 
this this is actually the second mode
which<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> strobing<00:03:02.090> effect<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.690> then

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
which is the strobing effect and then

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.420 
which is the strobing effect and then
the<00:03:02.900> third<00:03:03.109> mode<00:03:03.379> is<00:03:04.720> actually<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.109> fast

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the third mode is actually the fast

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.149 
the third mode is actually the fast
strobing<00:03:07.430> effect<00:03:08.560> which<00:03:09.560> is<00:03:09.590> pretty<00:03:09.859> cool<00:03:10.069> and

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
strobing effect which is pretty cool and

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.800 
strobing effect which is pretty cool and
you<00:03:10.250> can<00:03:10.340> see<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.640> wire<00:03:10.819> in<00:03:10.970> there<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.390> then

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
you can see the wire in there and then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.860 
you can see the wire in there and then
in<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.310> airbox<00:03:13.310> let<00:03:14.180> me<00:03:14.239> turn<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> lights

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
in the airbox let me turn the lights

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.830 
in the airbox let me turn the lights
back<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.260> for<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.389> yeah<00:03:17.389> what<00:03:17.569> I<00:03:17.599> basically

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
back on for you so yeah what I basically

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.870 
back on for you so yeah what I basically
did<00:03:18.290> was<00:03:19.630> actually<00:03:20.630> drilled<00:03:21.019> holes<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
did was actually drilled holes do the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.400 
did was actually drilled holes do the
black<00:03:23.060> plastics<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:25.180> put<00:03:26.180> zip<00:03:26.870> ties<00:03:27.079> on<00:03:27.319> them

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
black plastics and put zip ties on them

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.159 
black plastics and put zip ties on them
to<00:03:27.530> actually<00:03:27.650> hold<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.250> wire<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.959> as<00:03:30.049> you

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
to actually hold the wire in so as you

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.979 
to actually hold the wire in so as you
can<00:03:30.260> see<00:03:30.319> like<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.889> these<00:03:31.220> zip<00:03:31.579> ties<00:03:31.989> or

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
can see like all these zip ties or

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.930 
can see like all these zip ties or
holding<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.799> wire<00:03:34.010> into<00:03:34.370> place<00:03:35.859> what's<00:03:36.940> was

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
holding the wire into place what's was

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.439 
holding the wire into place what's was
kind<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.629> little<00:03:39.470> bit<00:03:39.620> hard<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.859> do<00:03:40.069> but<00:03:40.449> it

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
kind of a little bit hard to do but it

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.920 
kind of a little bit hard to do but it
only<00:03:41.569> took<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.900> day<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.349> then<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.160> here<00:03:43.430> I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
only took a day and then in here I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.599 
only took a day and then in here I
actually<00:03:44.930> had<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.560> inverter<00:03:45.889> which<00:03:46.160> powers

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
actually had the inverter which powers

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.659 
actually had the inverter which powers
off<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.510> eel<00:03:47.660> wire<00:03:47.989> which<00:03:48.650> runs<00:03:48.889> off<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.069> two

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
off the eel wire which runs off of two

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.180 
off the eel wire which runs off of two
double-a<00:03:50.120> batteries<00:03:50.449> I<00:03:50.709> actually<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:52.040> it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
double-a batteries I actually have it

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.939 
double-a batteries I actually have it
zip<00:03:52.430> tied<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.000> frame<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:54.349> what<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.560> did<00:03:54.799> was

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
zip tied to the frame and what I did was

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.909 
zip tied to the frame and what I did was
cut<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.959> little<00:03:56.959> bit<00:03:57.169> bigger<00:03:57.410> hole<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.829> was

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
cut a little bit bigger hole it was

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.159 
cut a little bit bigger hole it was
actually<00:03:58.220> smaller<00:03:58.280> before<00:03:58.910> around<00:03:59.150> here<00:03:59.480> but

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
actually smaller before around here but

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.599 
actually smaller before around here but
I<00:04:00.199> made<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> little<00:04:00.620> bit<00:04:00.919> bigger<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.579> I

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
I made it a little bit bigger so that I

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.780 
I made it a little bit bigger so that I
can<00:04:01.819> actually<00:04:02.180> stick<00:04:02.510> my<00:04:02.690> hand<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.230> there<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
can actually stick my hand in there and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.720 
can actually stick my hand in there and
turn<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.269> on<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.889> I<00:04:06.949> did<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.280> for<00:04:07.459> both<00:04:07.609> sides

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.080 

so<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:10.940> actually<00:04:11.389> zip<00:04:11.629> tied<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.230> frame

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so it's actually zip tied to the frame

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.569 
so it's actually zip tied to the frame
and<00:04:14.090> uh<00:04:15.549> yeah<00:04:16.549> that's<00:04:16.849> about<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:18.549> thanks<00:04:19.549> for

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and uh yeah that's about it thanks for

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.000 
and uh yeah that's about it thanks for
watching
