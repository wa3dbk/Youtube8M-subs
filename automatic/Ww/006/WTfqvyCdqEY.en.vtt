it<00:00:49.649> makes<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.100> difficult<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it makes it very difficult because the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
it makes it very difficult because the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
similar so the colorblind gamer will go

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.619
