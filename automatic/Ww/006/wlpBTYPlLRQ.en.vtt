00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
of the Aurora they realize wow this is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.510 
of the Aurora they realize wow this is
something<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:44.920> really<00:00:45.070> can't<00:00:45.400> even

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
something that you really can't even

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.890 
something that you really can't even
imagine<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:46.180> something<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.540> have<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.720> see

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
imagine it's something you have to see

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.070 
imagine it's something you have to see
in<00:00:47.170> person<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.790> imagine<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.239> Sun<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.930> be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
in person if you imagine the Sun to be

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560 
in person if you imagine the Sun to be
an<00:00:50.199> engine<00:00:50.530> which<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:51.129> reality<00:00:51.520> as<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.090> said<00:00:52.270> it

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
an engine which in reality as I said it

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.990 
an engine which in reality as I said it
is<00:00:52.600> it's<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.199> new<00:00:53.350> killer<00:00:53.680> engine<00:00:54.040> just<00:00:54.790> like

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
is it's a new killer engine just like

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.810 
is it's a new killer engine just like
any<00:00:55.300> other<00:00:55.540> engine<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.170> planet<00:00:56.920> Earth<00:00:57.040> here<00:00:57.370> it

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
any other engine on planet Earth here it

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.960 
any other engine on planet Earth here it
creates<00:00:58.180> exhaust<00:00:58.680> well<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.220> Sun<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.700> big

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
creates exhaust well the Sun is a big

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.120 
creates exhaust well the Sun is a big
ball<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.510> this<00:01:01.630> exhaust<00:01:02.050> radiates<00:01:02.829> in<00:01:03.010> all

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
ball and this exhaust radiates in all

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.580 
ball and this exhaust radiates in all
directions<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.940> eventually<00:01:04.780> some<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.410> that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
directions and eventually some of that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.719 
directions and eventually some of that
exhaust<00:01:06.420> crosses<00:01:07.420> through<00:01:07.600> space<00:01:07.960> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
exhaust crosses through space a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.969 
exhaust crosses through space a
mind-bending<00:01:09.729> speed<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.540> ends<00:01:10.990> up<00:01:11.200> colliding

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
mind-bending speed and ends up colliding

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.670 
mind-bending speed and ends up colliding
with<00:01:12.100> Earth's<00:01:12.340> magnetosphere<00:01:13.380> well<00:01:14.380> this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.760 
people at the science behind the Aurora
what<00:01:39.640> makes<00:01:39.849> you<00:01:39.940> or<00:01:40.209> happen<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.440> exact

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.410 
what makes you or happen is the exact
same<00:01:42.009> science<00:01:42.459> and<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.670> same<00:01:42.940> thing<00:01:43.240> that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
same science and the same thing that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.270 
same science and the same thing that
happens<00:01:43.780> when<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.200> neon<00:01:44.500> light<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.920> turned<00:01:45.069> on

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280

about is increasing in activity every 12
to<00:01:53.770> 13<00:01:54.130> years<00:01:54.160> we<00:01:54.520> have<00:01:54.670> something<00:01:55.000> called<00:01:55.149> a

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
to 13 years we have something called a

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.639 
to 13 years we have something called a
solar<00:01:55.539> cycle<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.880> people<00:01:58.090> believe<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
solar cycle a lot of people believe that

this particular solar maximum has

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.990 
this particular solar maximum has
potential<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.220> be<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:04.869> stronger<00:02:05.560> than<00:02:06.099> solar

around<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.880> world<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.330> right<00:02:10.869> now

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
around the world know that right now

when I think of swedish lapland i think

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.420 
when I think of swedish lapland i think
of<00:02:22.070> wide<00:02:22.580> open<00:02:22.610> spaces<00:02:23.950> beautiful<00:02:24.950> scenery
