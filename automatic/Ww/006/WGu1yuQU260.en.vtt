00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.869 

believe<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.109> float<00:00:58.500> mode<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
believe I'm in float mode now which is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
believe I'm in float mode now which is
the<00:01:00.300> easiest<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> modes<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the easiest of the modes but it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.149 
the easiest of the modes but it's
basically<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.940> new<00:01:03.180> interface<00:01:03.539> their<00:01:04.159> type

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
basically the new interface their type

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
basically the new interface their type
to<00:01:05.369> bring<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.790> there's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> throttle<00:01:07.110> slider

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to bring it up there's a throttle slider

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:16.700 
to bring it up there's a throttle slider
on<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:10.340> slow<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:12.330> fast

mountains<00:01:20.700> gotta<00:01:21.420> lean<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:22.110> down<00:01:26.420> going

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420

through<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> Kings<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:32.580> can<00:01:32.850> put<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
through the Kings you can put on a

I'm going to tap again and change that
float<00:01:51.120> icon<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:52.850> slime<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:55.830> there's<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
float icon to slime and now there's a

float icon to slime and now there's a
good<00:01:56.190> chance<00:01:56.610> i'll<00:01:56.910> crash<00:01:57.300> some<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.290> really

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
good chance i'll crash some not really

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
good chance i'll crash some not really
paying<00:01:58.770> attention<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:02.400> speaking<00:02:02.910> of

away<00:02:24.780> after<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.170> game<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:30.380> not<00:02:31.380> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
away after a bit so this game is not a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.090 
away after a bit so this game is not a
flight<00:02:31.920> simulator<00:02:32.460> like<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:34.020> not<00:02:34.290> it's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
flight simulator like it's not it's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.060 
flight simulator like it's not it's
pretty<00:02:35.310> fun<00:02:35.840> I'll<00:02:36.840> basically<00:02:37.200> go<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:37.980> do

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
pretty fun I'll basically go in and do

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.180 
pretty fun I'll basically go in and do
this<00:02:38.220> sort<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> thing<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:40.170> about<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> minute<00:02:40.980> or

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
this sort of thing for about a minute or

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.050 
this sort of thing for about a minute or
two<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.520> big<00:02:44.790> old<00:02:44.940> loop<00:02:46.460> can<00:02:47.460> run<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.940> other

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
two if a big old loop can run the other

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.340 
two if a big old loop can run the other
side<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:49.350> crash

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.950 

can<00:02:54.890> exit<00:02:55.400> out<00:02:55.520> of<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> main<00:02:55.880> menu<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.690> do

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
can exit out of the main menu you can do

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.070
