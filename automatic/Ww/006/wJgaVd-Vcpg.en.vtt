00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.070
 color ring to give 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.400
 individuality tool 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.509
 the first tablet said it was good 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.250
 for beginners 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:56.880

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.550
 I finally opened it 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:19.110
 Perhaps all help is stored with Bryn 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:21.680
 We put such a garbage is not the box 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.690
 pretty good to touch 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.239
 paid attention to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.360
 just like I don’t know as if any 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:38.340
 he ipad unpack print minimalism 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 all that, and here it is so even to me 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.200
 the wolves wrote great god here he is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.350
 actually the tablet itself is well 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.400
 small yes, I'll show you like this 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.930
 small but I think its advantages 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.430
 oh oh you acts in general, what's right here 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.810
 There is even all not such a horse I'm here on 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.549
 but it is clear it is visible to 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.140
 held up better or for 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.269
 Now this garbage is somehow suspicious 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.880
 moves maybe this is for adjustment 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.320
 any general is written here 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.630
 general coating that's how aypada say 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.920
 the knife is somehow well somehow well as 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.440
 Duc is not a little here any fall but 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:35.540
 it seems so so now aside 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.900
 She even has such a little book. 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.400
 boll so it's our natural 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.450
 I do not read it so put off 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.440
 I don’t want to open it aside 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.739
 tear but apparently not have so 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.859
 apparently it as possible to connect 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.970
 probably this does not know maybe 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.760
 spare parts 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.810
 I'm still this 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.379
 I really do not understand the disk 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.040
 drivers 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.319
 different so this is what we have book on 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.650
 exploitation perhaps read in 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:18.470
 difference from these leaders i'm the first time 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:25.180
 buy how to exploit this one 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:29.860
 the wire and here it is here it is a feather 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.979
 here so this is all it is possible with him 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.130
 static 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:39.260
 the feather did not fall into the hands of something nice 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.880
 buttons which is probably not on me 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.900
 report 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.169
 let's figure it out very conveniently covering something 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.199
 inside there is something rustling big tub 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:59.030
 good ballpoint pen in hand lies 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:05:02.510
 very well comfortable so well then yes 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.240
 principle like a pen just balls and here 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:16.099
 still some dots I have in this matter 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:18.770
 I do not understand at all therefore well so 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.560
 Well, why I made this tablet I do not know 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.780
 said or not you do not remember too 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.229
 good for beginners he is not so 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.139
 professional simple is not wrong 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.720
 too expensive and it is thousands and a half 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.139
 I don't seem to know 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.470
 so much in general we will draw 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.990
 on it photoshop 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.510
 Well, all I wanted to say afterwards is cessna 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.639
 we will deal with him what to do 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.280
