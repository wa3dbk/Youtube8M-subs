00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.160 
unraveled and the only thing I'm not too
sure<00:04:05.709> about<00:04:05.769> is<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.070> my<00:04:06.700> natural<00:04:07.420> hair<00:04:07.600> comes

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
sure about is that my natural hair comes

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.620 
sure about is that my natural hair comes
like<00:04:08.680> right<00:04:08.920> up<00:04:09.070> in<00:04:09.250> here<00:04:10.060> somewhere

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
like right up in here somewhere

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.400 
like right up in here somewhere
and<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.500> back<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:13.060> natural<00:04:13.570> hair<00:04:13.690> probably

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
and in the back my natural hair probably

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.120 
and in the back my natural hair probably
hits<00:04:14.739> me<00:04:14.890> like<00:04:14.920> right<00:04:15.250> up<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.549> here<00:04:15.850> so<00:04:16.690> I

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
hits me like right up in here so I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.099 
hits me like right up in here so I
didn't<00:04:18.130> get<00:04:18.280> how<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:19.000> back<00:04:19.239> braids<00:04:19.660> and

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
didn't get how like the back braids and

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.820 
didn't get how like the back braids and
we<00:04:20.229> find<00:04:20.500> some<00:04:20.769> back<00:04:20.950> brace<00:04:22.560> see<00:04:23.560> how<00:04:23.680> it's

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
we find some back brace see how it's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.310 
we find some back brace see how it's
only<00:04:23.950> braided<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:25.240> right<00:04:25.540> here<00:04:25.870> right<00:04:26.080> above

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
only braided like right here right above

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.560 
only braided like right here right above
my<00:04:26.500> shoulder<00:04:26.919> with<00:04:27.520> my<00:04:27.669> own<00:04:27.910> hair<00:04:28.240> it's<00:04:28.479> like

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
my shoulder with my own hair it's like

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.950 
my shoulder with my own hair it's like
really<00:04:28.840> down<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.200> here<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:30.030> I'm<00:04:31.030> guessing

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
really down in here so I'm guessing

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.000 
really down in here so I'm guessing
either<00:04:32.490> my<00:04:33.490> hair<00:04:33.760> shrunk<00:04:34.090> up<00:04:34.270> or<00:04:34.830> some<00:04:35.830> of<00:04:35.919> my

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
either my hair shrunk up or some of my

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.280 
either my hair shrunk up or some of my
hair<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.370> down

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
hair is down

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.080 
hair is down
mesh<00:04:38.290> ends<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> braids<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:39.820> for<00:04:40.000> that

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
mesh ends are the braids so for that

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.960 
mesh ends are the braids so for that
reason<00:04:40.150> I'm<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.720> be<00:04:40.840> really<00:04:41.110> careful

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
reason I'm I have to be really careful

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.330 
reason I'm I have to be really careful
taking<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.210> down

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
taking it down

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.010 
taking it down
or<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.550> them<00:04:46.759> be<00:04:46.999> careful<00:04:47.120> taking<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.599> down

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
or have them be careful taking it down

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.499 
or have them be careful taking it down
but<00:04:48.469> I'm<00:04:48.770> happy<00:04:49.099> satisfied<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:49.969> just<00:04:50.270> want<00:04:50.419> to
