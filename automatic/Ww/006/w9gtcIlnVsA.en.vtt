00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.929
 well the first scouting is actually 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 been all the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.420
 so not a reasonable exhibition game 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.950
 family at the beginning of August that was when I had 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.630
 already said of well we are going this competition 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 approach despite being incomplete 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 strange as a serious game because 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.800
 a sleek jamie opponent is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 team of that team 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 because it was a gala much the are 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.840
 great just a lot of players who 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 tomorrow 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.810
 I cannot accept the colleague 's choices 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.949
 look but will also play tomorrow 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.719
 and we also have it 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 usual what we always do 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.860
 position the olympiakos competition 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 We have scouted 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.570
 and last weekend the last one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 contest so nyoni jos and and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 olivia posts are business and greet 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.020
 the two of us 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.280
 we have all merged 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 started preparations or 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 plates no 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 the picture what we have of it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 Olympiakos also in the match against 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 against police and share 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.609
 two faces very good first half 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 also supported by the great audience 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.869
 the course we had already experienced 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.570
 in August the tilt in the second 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 half in which the qualities of van 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.799
 Paris' moment and and they came out 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 thus also the match won but 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.570
 it is very long until I think it is the 70th 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 minute it is an ascending right 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 been an upcoming match and a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.299
 serious opponent but i can i 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 keep saying it every game 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.590
 the champions league 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
 we have something just like olympiakos 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.220
 and we are both bad 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.220
 started the campaign 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.500
 and we both have to fight for something now 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.150
 we are worthy and play to 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.010
 and I think that's for our money 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.900
 but certainly also for my piano 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.230
 I am a coach who always watches 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.140
 to what who what who has seen what 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.610
 show players and that was the yourself 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.900
 that was certainly not good but the second 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.960
 half especially with the young ones because 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.910
 I often use that word myself 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.850
 they profiled themselves and then look 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.620
 you in the way of playing 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.120
 that is the most important thing for me 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.000
 we will play tomorrow compared to 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.830
 an opponent in that chompy sleek 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.320
 and the moment you definitely have that for 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.210
 yourself and of course I'm out of it 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.010
 you go there too the players at 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.860
 and I must say that you are one 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.380
 very serious candidate option is to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 start up but that has 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 nothing to do with that 16 or what's there 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.480
 that too has to do with being 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.790
 quality of play and to do with the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 quality what our team what it 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.380
 midfield possibly needs for 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.630
 both really only counts the winnings 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.100
 because if you don't do that then I think 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 that you follow the facts at the corner 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.430
 run, only the course 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.530
 well that we with all our eagerness 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.540
 which we we will certainly show tomorrow 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.209
 in the in the home game 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 yes that we must not go beyond ourselves 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.180
 walk away 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.130
 I think that will be a task especially for 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.590
 for our staff of players that too 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 bring that with it 90 minutes now 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.650
 not because you are not in the first minute 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.690
 have to win 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.730
 I also don't think it's a question or with 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.310
 play defensive midfielders 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.060
 i think it is more one or two i think 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.300
 that it is more 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.220
 Case becomes yes if we like it with 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.280
 two play that one of those two too 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.650
 offensive has to do with me and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 mix that mix we have to go 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.730
 Find and I you for making it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.629
 recent weeks 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.480
 with sacha and with July and that the two 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.709
 types are those 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.780
 can play defensively in the in the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.970
 controlling role 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260
 hp also once offensive 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.480
 to be able to impart that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.160
 and yes we need that mix that balance 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.780
 we have to find it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 is the shame if you lose benfica 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.769
 was another light being I do n't think so 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.560
 certainly not it a shame when 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.739
 Olympiakos are the membrane of your body 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 gym and there by all means that they 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.120
 I don't think the hair-in-the- socket, too 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.099
 but with that i don't mean that 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.870
 we have been in, and I was talking to 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.340
 ie yes I was more or less written off 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.349
 are for 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.569
 for further participation based on the 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.489
 first game ok clear 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.019
 but I think it's only now for us 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.199
 is going to start and we have to show it 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:19.260
 that both us and olympiakos 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.090
 right to speak am in europe you can 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.220
 just some conclusions from the games 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.280
 played in a Gaasbeek is Central Africa 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.810
 the game was played for nothing there was 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.930
 no private stitch 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.520
 sosiski même chose jugée this faster this 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.800
 beautiful physically open weekend varieties 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.710
 conclusion that they were a physical 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.780
 team at the deleted the e-mail address 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.520
 pauwels and leaked in tanks 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.500
 in our opinion, labor party is foam 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.020
 picasso essential deepen their skin 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.150
 folders and oxalis kooijman software 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.710
 that zero who in me is not a week late hour 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.940
 I sleep again at the place where show 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.099
 to be able to offer a jersey 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.810
 nets reach ease children 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.669
 we make a plan impossible for them to 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.620
 can win and that is it for us 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:07.410
 most important and yes we have to 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.240
 be very patient and very patient 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.639
 that we are not missing out on the 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.800
 opponent because the quality of the 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.889
 opponent also certainly with very 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.380
 much faster guys yes that can be 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.599
 what we could possibly leave 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.120
 and that is something we will have to 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.129
 supporters are allowed to prevent growth 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.580
 beetles 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.739
 extra edge pink 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.959
 but who will in olympia chose for a moment 

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:35.209
 was a full stage that there was a release 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.099
 on some crazy for exorbitant team 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.860
 he hoped rock supporters 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.319
 army libie eines of the first minus kiss 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.879
 with me at all realizes margins and 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.389
 least was assen the this is a very 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.550
 important game for the valves in on a 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.319
 change her big step surprising none 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.849
 I will find my baby's April lessons 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.009
 your personal storyteller for the sake of 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.300
 extra trip to confidence boost and 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.300
 an epic extra and libie
