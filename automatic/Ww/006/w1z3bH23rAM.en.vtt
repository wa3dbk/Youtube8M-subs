00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
settings I think they're okay I would

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.529 
settings I think they're okay I would
have<00:01:41.740> liked<00:01:41.919> to<00:01:42.069> have<00:01:42.099> seen<00:01:42.310> sprint<00:01:42.789> I<00:01:42.999> don't

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
have liked to have seen sprint I don't

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.169 
have liked to have seen sprint I don't
like<00:01:43.749> that<00:01:43.779> MLG<00:01:44.639> they're<00:01:45.639> trying<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:45.999> get<00:01:46.119> a

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
like that MLG they're trying to get a

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.809 
like that MLG they're trying to get a
mainstream<00:01:46.599> audience<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.709> they<00:01:47.859> divert<00:01:48.669> the

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
mainstream audience but they divert the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.139 
mainstream audience but they divert the
game<00:01:48.999> so<00:01:49.419> far<00:01:49.749> from<00:01:50.319> what<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.549> know<00:01:51.669> casual

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
game so far from what you know casual

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.909 
game so far from what you know casual
gamers<00:01:52.509> with<00:01:52.659> play<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.049> as<00:01:53.169> I<00:01:53.409> think<00:01:53.649> it's<00:01:53.739> hard

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:53.919 
gamers with play it as I think it's hard

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:55.739 
gamers with play it as I think it's hard
for<00:01:54.069> them<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.219> get<00:01:54.429> involved<00:01:54.729> one<00:01:55.479> hundred

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
for them to get involved one hundred

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.790 
for them to get involved one hundred
twenty<00:01:55.779> percent<00:01:56.349> speed<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.859> just<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.130> little

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
twenty percent speed is just a little

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.110 
twenty percent speed is just a little
it<00:01:58.070> feels<00:01:58.520> skatey<00:01:58.940> like<00:01:59.270> you're<00:01:59.420> an<00:01:59.510> ice<00:01:59.690> rink

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
it feels skatey like you're an ice rink

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.370 
it feels skatey like you're an ice rink
maybe<00:02:02.120> they<00:02:02.330> would<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.540> went<00:02:02.690> one<00:02:02.900> tenant

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
maybe they would have went one tenant

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.560 
maybe they would have went one tenant
and<00:02:03.560> sprint<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.370> mean<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.910> reason<00:02:05.180> they<00:02:05.480> don't

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and sprint I mean the reason they don't

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.760 
and sprint I mean the reason they don't
like<00:02:05.750> sprint<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.170> they<00:02:06.260> feel<00:02:06.410> like<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.620> can

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
like sprint is they feel like you can

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.070 
like sprint is they feel like you can
get<00:02:06.920> away<00:02:07.010> too<00:02:07.220> easily<00:02:07.490> from<00:02:08.000> battles<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.840> i

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
get away too easily from battles but i

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.380 
get away too easily from battles but i
think<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.520> added<00:02:10.520> element<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.360> game

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
think that added element to the game

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.690 
think that added element to the game
makes<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.290> more<00:02:12.470> interesting<00:02:12.800> obviously

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
makes it more interesting obviously

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490 
makes it more interesting obviously
under<00:02:13.880> mo<00:02:14.090> g<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.570> time<00:02:14.810> constraints<00:02:15.290> with

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
under mo g of time constraints with

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500 
under mo g of time constraints with
matches<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.490> know<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:16.910> people<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.330> too

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
matches so you know if people get too

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.510 
matches so you know if people get too
good<00:02:17.690> at<00:02:17.780> running<00:02:17.900> away<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> worry

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
good at running away you have to worry

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.330 
good at running away you have to worry
about<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.760> i<00:02:20.210> mean<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:21.830> kind<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.100> give<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
about that i mean it's kind of give and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.440 
about that i mean it's kind of give and
take<00:02:22.400> i<00:02:22.640> understand<00:02:23.120> where<00:02:23.270> they're<00:02:23.420> coming

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
take i understand where they're coming

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.510 
take i understand where they're coming
from<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> would<00:02:24.710> have<00:02:24.800> liked<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.220> scene

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
from but I would have liked this scene

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.280 
from but I would have liked this scene
sprint<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> game<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.750> don't<00:02:26.960> really<00:02:27.050> care

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
sprint in the game I don't really care

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.110 
sprint in the game I don't really care
for<00:02:27.470> any<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.740> others<00:02:27.950> armor<00:02:28.400> lock<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.820> think

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
for any of the others armor lock I think

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.550 
for any of the others armor lock I think
is<00:02:29.270> too<00:02:29.540> overpowered<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.200> can't<00:02:30.440> have

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
is too overpowered you can't have

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800 
is too overpowered you can't have
everyone<00:02:30.830> armor<00:02:31.220> locking<00:02:31.400> same<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.330> jetpack

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
everyone armor locking same with jetpack

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
everyone armor locking same with jetpack
people<00:02:33.680> getting<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.040> spots<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.550> they

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
people getting in spots that they

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.650 
people getting in spots that they
shouldn't<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.090> able<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:36.970> hologram<00:02:37.970> you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
shouldn't be able to get in hologram you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.060 
shouldn't be able to get in hologram you
know<00:02:38.750> personally<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> think<00:02:39.200> hologram<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:39.830> kind

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
know personally I think hologram is kind

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.490 
know personally I think hologram is kind
of<00:02:40.220> funny<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:41.030> mean<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.750> mean<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.930> works<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
of funny I mean it I mean it works on a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.980 
of funny I mean it I mean it works on a
competitive<00:02:42.830> level<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:44.150> gears<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.540> war<00:02:44.780> we

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
competitive level and gears of war we

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.080 
competitive level and gears of war we
used<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.440> fake<00:02:45.710> rushes<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.910> feel<00:02:47.060> like

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
used to do fake rushes and I feel like

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.660 
used to do fake rushes and I feel like
hologram<00:02:47.810> kind<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.320> sets<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.860> up<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.460> have

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
hologram kind of sets you up to have

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.910 
hologram kind of sets you up to have
fake<00:02:50.000> rushes<00:02:50.450> maybe<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.380> four<00:02:51.620> people

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
fake rushes maybe with four people

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.680 
fake rushes maybe with four people
hologram<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> little<00:02:53.270> over<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.660> top

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
hologram that's a little over the top

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.860 
hologram that's a little over the top
but<00:02:54.170> nonetheless<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:55.730> they<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.120> sniper<00:02:56.510> ammo

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
but nonetheless if they have sniper ammo

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.930 
but nonetheless if they have sniper ammo
and<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.680> don't<00:02:57.860> want<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.070> take<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> shot<00:02:58.340> at

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and you don't want to take a shot at

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.780 
and you don't want to take a shot at
risk<00:02:59.600> you<00:03:00.440> know<00:03:00.530> getting<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.160> head<00:03:01.340> shot<00:03:01.580> or

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
risk you know getting a head shot or

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.090 
risk you know getting a head shot or
something<00:03:01.940> happening<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:03.140> can<00:03:03.290> push<00:03:03.530> put<00:03:04.010> out

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
something happening you can push put out

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.370 
something happening you can push put out
a<00:03:04.130> hologram<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.660> know<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.810> feel<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:06.230> that

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
a hologram and you know I feel like that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.070 
a hologram and you know I feel like that
counteracts<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.340> lot<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.300> power<00:03:08.630> weapon

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
counteracts a lot of the power weapon

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.650 
counteracts a lot of the power weapon
play<00:03:09.760> especially<00:03:10.760> because<00:03:11.180> Rockets<00:03:11.570> are

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
play especially because Rockets are

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.840 
play especially because Rockets are
overpowered<00:03:12.290> they're<00:03:13.250> very<00:03:13.640> very

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
overpowered they're very very

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.250 
overpowered they're very very
overpowered<00:03:14.270> I<00:03:14.390> feel<00:03:14.600> like<00:03:14.750> those<00:03:14.900> need<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.140> be

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
overpowered I feel like those need to be

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.560 
overpowered I feel like those need to be
switched<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.680> with<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.950> grenade<00:03:16.250> launcher<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
switched out with the grenade launcher I

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.410 
switched out with the grenade launcher I
think<00:03:18.230> hologram<00:03:18.680> kind<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.040> allows<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.670> back

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
think hologram kind of allows that back

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.740 
think hologram kind of allows that back
and<00:03:20.660> forth<00:03:20.860> game<00:03:21.860> play<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.239> you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
and forth game play and it's not you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.270 
and forth game play and it's not you
know<00:03:23.780> something<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.290> breaks<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.739> game<00:03:25.070> I

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
know something that breaks the game I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560 
know something that breaks the game I
don't<00:03:25.640> feel<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.970> breaks<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.270> game<00:03:26.420> in

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
don't feel like it breaks the game in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.990 
don't feel like it breaks the game in
any<00:03:26.690> way<00:03:26.900> those<00:03:27.620> are<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:27.980> things<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.880> are

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
any way those are the things that are

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.880 
any way those are the things that are
really<00:03:29.420> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> annoying<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.680> one

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
really kind of annoying so the one

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.260 
really kind of annoying so the one
twenty<00:03:31.160> percent<00:03:31.489> speed<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.850> feel<00:03:32.000> like<00:03:32.060> it's

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
twenty percent speed I feel like it's

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.290 
twenty percent speed I feel like it's
too<00:03:32.480> high<00:03:32.720> right<00:03:33.260> now<00:03:33.550> they<00:03:34.550> were<00:03:34.610> also<00:03:34.940> raised

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
too high right now they were also raised

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.590 
too high right now they were also raised
the<00:03:35.390> jump<00:03:35.690> high<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.050> don't<00:03:36.230> mind<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.040> at<00:03:37.160> all

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the jump high I don't mind that at all

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.390 
the jump high I don't mind that at all
and<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.840> gravity<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.590> believe<00:03:39.950> they<00:03:40.070> added

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
and the gravity I believe they added

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.150 
and the gravity I believe they added
gravity<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.030> fall<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.390> little<00:03:41.660> bit<00:03:41.900> faster

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
gravity so you fall a little bit faster

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.410 
gravity so you fall a little bit faster
again<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.489> don't<00:03:43.640> mind<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.120> doesn't

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
again I don't mind that that doesn't

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.850 
again I don't mind that that doesn't
really<00:03:44.600> break<00:03:44.900> make<00:03:45.140> or<00:03:45.260> break<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.530> game<00:03:45.680> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
really break make or break the game the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.320 
really break make or break the game the
biggest<00:03:46.070> thing<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.400> me<00:03:46.550> right<00:03:46.670> now<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.180> that

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
biggest thing to me right now is that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330 
biggest thing to me right now is that
sprint<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.780> gone<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.770> should<00:03:49.070> be<00:03:49.100> in<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
sprint is gone and it should be in the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.699 
sprint is gone and it should be in the
game<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:50.750> hundred<00:03:50.989> twenty<00:03:51.020> percent

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
game and one hundred twenty percent

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.380 
game and one hundred twenty percent
speed<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.160> too<00:03:52.370> fast<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.910> feels<00:03:53.090> like<00:03:53.209> you're

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
speed is too fast it feels like you're

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.060 
speed is too fast it feels like you're
skating<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:53.840> an<00:03:53.989> ice<00:03:54.110> rink<00:03:54.350> basically<00:03:54.920> when

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
skating on an ice rink basically when

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.610 
skating on an ice rink basically when
you<00:03:55.100> go<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.400> play<00:03:56.000> now<00:03:56.480> any<00:03:56.810> other<00:03:57.019> game<00:03:57.320> type

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
you go to play now any other game type

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.890 
you go to play now any other game type
it<00:03:57.920> doesn't<00:03:58.760> feel<00:03:58.970> right<00:03:59.180> because<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.600> speed

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
it doesn't feel right because the speed

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.570 
it doesn't feel right because the speed
is<00:04:00.080> too<00:04:00.260> fast<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.220> know<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:01.340> you're

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
is too fast if you you know if you're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.670 
is too fast if you you know if you're
not<00:04:01.700> practicing<00:04:01.940> customs<00:04:02.720> going<00:04:03.500> into

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
not practicing customs going into

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.100 
not practicing customs going into
another<00:04:03.860> game<00:04:04.100> type<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.519> kind<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.810> doesn't

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
another game type is kind of it doesn't

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.800 
another game type is kind of it doesn't
really<00:04:06.200> help<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.650> practice<00:04:06.980> at<00:04:07.310> all<00:04:07.430> because

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
really help you practice at all because

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
really help you practice at all because
is<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.380> completely<00:04:09.160> different<00:04:09.550> game<00:04:09.580> I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
is just a completely different game I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.339 
is just a completely different game I
feel<00:04:10.450> like<00:04:10.540> if<00:04:10.720> they<00:04:10.840> were<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.230> do<00:04:11.319> that

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
feel like if they were going to do that

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.740 
feel like if they were going to do that
they<00:04:11.620> should<00:04:11.830> just<00:04:11.860> kept<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.340> halo<00:04:12.849> 3<00:04:13.209> on<00:04:13.420> this

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
they should just kept on halo 3 on this

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.300 
they should just kept on halo 3 on this
circuit<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.230> mean<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:14.620> just<00:04:14.800> my<00:04:14.920> personal

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
circuit I mean that's just my personal

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.039 
circuit I mean that's just my personal
opinion<00:04:15.370> right<00:04:15.819> now<00:04:15.849> some<00:04:16.600> people<00:04:16.720> like<00:04:17.019> it

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
opinion right now some people like it

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.900 
opinion right now some people like it
some<00:04:17.380> people<00:04:17.440> don't<00:04:17.709> obviously<00:04:18.519> this<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.820> what

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
some people don't obviously this is what

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.530 
some people don't obviously this is what
we<00:04:19.030> have<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.239> go<00:04:19.359> with<00:04:19.540> going<00:04:19.840> forward

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
we have to go with going forward

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.670 
we have to go with going forward
hopefully<00:04:22.540> they'll<00:04:22.720> make<00:04:22.900> some<00:04:23.110> changes<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
hopefully they'll make some changes and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.120 
hopefully they'll make some changes and
include<00:04:24.610> sprint<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.270> turn<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.570> speed<00:04:25.840> down

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
include sprint and turn the speed down

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.500 
include sprint and turn the speed down
that<00:04:27.130> will<00:04:27.250> be<00:04:27.820> nice<00:04:28.030> i<00:04:28.210> think<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.419> would

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
that will be nice i think it would

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.740 
that will be nice i think it would
appeal<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.930> lot<00:04:29.080> more<00:04:29.230> people<00:04:29.620> but<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:31.480> far

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
appeal to a lot more people but so far

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.720 
appeal to a lot more people but so far
we<00:04:32.020> our<00:04:32.320> progression<00:04:32.740> has<00:04:32.950> been<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.610> know

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
we our progression has been you know

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.460 
we our progression has been you know
fairly<00:04:34.060> decent<00:04:34.540> it's<00:04:34.660> still<00:04:35.110> kind<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.320> slow

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
fairly decent it's still kind of slow

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.350 
fairly decent it's still kind of slow
obviously<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.280> know<00:04:36.400> most<00:04:36.550> of<00:04:36.700> us<00:04:36.850> I've<00:04:37.060> never

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
obviously you know most of us I've never

obviously you know most of us I've never
played<00:04:37.600> halo<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.110> haven't<00:04:38.380> touched<00:04:38.470> halo<00:04:38.860> since
