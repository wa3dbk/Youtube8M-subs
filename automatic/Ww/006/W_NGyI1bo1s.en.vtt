another video as you can see this was a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
another video as you can see this was a
little<00:00:08.970> bit<00:00:09.179> different<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.780> got<00:00:09.990> rid<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.200> my<00:00:10.380> old

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
little bit different I got rid of my old

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.780 
little bit different I got rid of my old
rig<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.160> had<00:00:11.429> sold<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.300> eBay<00:00:12.540> actually

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
rig that I had sold on eBay actually

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.680 
rig that I had sold on eBay actually
decided<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.849> make<00:00:15.030> something<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> little<00:00:15.599> bit

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
decided to make something a little bit

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.930 
decided to make something a little bit
bigger<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.990> little<00:00:16.199> bit<00:00:16.410> better<00:00:16.619> faster<00:00:17.369> this

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
bigger a little bit better faster this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.750 
bigger a little bit better faster this
is<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> crimson<00:00:20.010> tank<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.550> guess

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
is this is the crimson tank I guess

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.040 
is this is the crimson tank I guess
we'll<00:00:20.910> start<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> K<00:00:21.480> since<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:21.900> what

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
we'll start with the K since that's what

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
we'll start with the K since that's what
