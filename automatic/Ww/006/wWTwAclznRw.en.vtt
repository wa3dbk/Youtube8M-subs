today we're going to take a look at how

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.360 
today we're going to take a look at how
to<00:00:07.569> identify<00:00:07.810> these<00:00:08.170> patients<00:00:08.830> as<00:00:08.950> well<00:00:09.309> as

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
to identify these patients as well as

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.970
