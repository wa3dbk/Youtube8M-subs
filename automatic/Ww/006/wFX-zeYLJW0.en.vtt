has<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> elevation<00:01:02.340> change<00:01:02.840> some

has to do with the elevation change some
of<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.470> also<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.129> I've<00:01:05.280> had<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.729> come

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
of it is also because I've had to come

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
of it is also because I've had to come
on<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> off<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.680> cruise<00:01:07.950> control<00:01:08.369> checks

um

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
um

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
um
but<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.020> thought<00:02:04.140> everyone<00:02:04.590> should<00:02:04.619> be

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but I just thought everyone should be

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.130 
but I just thought everyone should be
aware<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.840> fuel

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
aware that I think a lot of your fuel

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
aware that I think a lot of your fuel
economy<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> do

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
economy is not just going to have to do

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.190 
economy is not just going to have to do
with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> program<00:02:09.270> or<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
with the program or it's also going to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.910 
with the program or it's also going to
do<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.550> obviously<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.200> type<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> driving

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
do with obviously the type of driving

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.210 
do with obviously the type of driving
that's<00:02:14.069> going<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.489> down<00:02:15.300> there<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.540> Florida

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
that's going on down there in Florida

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.530 
that's going on down there in Florida
don't<00:02:17.220> think<00:02:17.430> I've<00:02:17.520> touched<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:17.970> brakes<00:02:18.270> for

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

three<00:02:18.780> hours<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.739> had<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.069> cruise

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
three hours I just had it on cruise

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.509 
three hours I just had it on cruise
control<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:22.140> was<00:02:22.260> pretty<00:02:22.440> easy<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.220> in

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519

Georgia<00:02:23.910> seems<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.630> though<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:24.989> constantly

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
Georgia seems as though I'm constantly

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.930 
Georgia seems as though I'm constantly
having<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.280> adjust<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:27.180> speed<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:28.940> accommodate

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
having to adjust my speed to accommodate

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.720 
having to adjust my speed to accommodate
for<00:02:30.120> traffic<00:02:30.860> more<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.130> than<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> think

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
for traffic more so than that I think

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.520 
for traffic more so than that I think
the<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.599> right<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:33.900> we're<00:02:34.080> going<00:02:34.230> downhill

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the like right now we're going downhill

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.220 
the like right now we're going downhill
we<00:02:35.310> were<00:02:35.459> going<00:02:35.760> uphill<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.390> seemed<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.959> about

two<00:02:37.530> miles<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> fact<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.630> Georgia<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
two miles is the fact that Georgia is a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.440 
two miles is the fact that Georgia is a
very<00:02:40.709> hilly<00:02:41.100> terrain<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:44.190> still<00:02:44.459> 25.8

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
miles a gallon is outstanding if you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.970 
miles a gallon is outstanding if you
compare<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.590> any<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> other

tolerable at first it seemed a little
obnoxious<00:03:22.900> because<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> exhaust<00:03:24.099> is<00:03:24.370> quite

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640
