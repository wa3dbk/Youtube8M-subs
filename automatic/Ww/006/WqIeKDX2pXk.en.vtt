00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 Today is the last video of me 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.919
 from the back to school row you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.990
 together with nina from channel lina kucera 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 have made the playlist you find 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 up here and in the infobox as already 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.800
 as always today it should be around 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.300
 School closings are easy 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 and can do it quickly in front of the school 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 and still interesting and beautiful 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 Look because I 'm quite a bit 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.490
 hairstyles like you might in the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 I can not see any videos 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.469
 so much leeway and that's all 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.579
 hairstyles the left but as I said 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 be nice i'm a bit 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 awkward as far as that goes, but I give 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 my firm so the hairstyles I 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 you show you in any case 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.180
 because if I can do that then 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 Can you do that? I'll show you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.969
 today three hairstyles and I hope you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 have a lot of fun doing the first 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.600
 Hairstyle I want to show you is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 a very simple hairstyle I'm in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.820
 I like to wear summer wear 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.980
 First, the hair back and take that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.170
 most of it to a very high 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.150
 Ponytail together I only leave 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 a big strand left about the same 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 from a crest to my ear 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.250
 I go and the rest of my hair is mine 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 me now to a ponytail 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.200
 together and leave them alone first 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.270
 and then I take the strand left over 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.430
 stayed and weave it into one 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 French braid and I take it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020
 three little wisps and lichens to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.490
 down and a bit to the side though 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.829
 my hair otherwise no matter how small ruppel 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.890
 form and always take on the outside 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.229
 I sprinkle a little until I complete 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 I've got all the hair intertwined 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 have separated then I use the time 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 above for example a few lost 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.439
 gone striving to put away or 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.329
 My baby hair is something to tame and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.460
 then I take the little braid and 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.740
 Wrap it around the back of my head 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 ponytail and then it looks quite 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.079
 About like this and then I fix it 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 again with one or two hair clips 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.719
 and if you want, you can too 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 just take the ponytail and that 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.369
 whole then again to a loose 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.040
 and tie together and then you have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.550
 a simple hairstyle to the hair 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.530
 completely out of the face in the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.300
 and actually quite forget the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.100
 I really wear it very much in the summer 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.770
 like and i think she actually sees 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.060
 also very pretty and very elegant 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.100
 and the second hairstyle starts on the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 evening before and with fresh 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.370
 You can wash your hair 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.800
 almost dry and then she fought 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.710
 once so that no knots in it 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.480
 are and then starts to the entire 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.000
 hair to a French braid 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.140
 braid or a touchpad that can 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.570
 Do as you like 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.820
 and you found it very high on the head 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.190
 and then you just take out of the 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.610
 middle three strands and just take 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.800
 always with the outer strands something h 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.780
 as well as with the other pots 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
 no hair left and at 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.790
 Everything is braided down and that 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.220
 then look after you're done 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.040
 It does not have to be great 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.080
 be neat it easy enough just 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.730
 that all hair is braided and that 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.430
 It's best to do whole things relatively well 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560
 firm so it does not go on at night 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.110
 and you can do that the next morning 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.510
 whole open then there then removed 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 just the zoff and possibly the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.100
 hairclips you still in the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.870
 has stuck hair and then starts the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.330
 curls that have formed 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.160
 slowly dissolve and you will notice 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.840
 that not every strand is super nice 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.910
 That's why I take it 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.959
 again a curling iron here the ramic 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.610
 Pearl Wand and go through it again 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.170
 about the strive over it so loose 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.120
 again the individual strands themselves 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.630
 by nature not so attractively curled 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 to have 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.580
 and then you find that very much 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.700
 nice result and the beautiful yet 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.560
 against head without her for hours 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.330
 it took a while for it in the morning 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.850
 it takes much less easy 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.140
 five strands to lure than the whole 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.760
 I think that's a great head 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.680
 Method to make sure yours 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 hair the next day reasonably well 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.540
 Do not sit for hours without it 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.180
 want to spend in the bathroom around you 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.390
 to make hair and the third variant 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 is a special braid for it you take 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.480
 your hair and she also knows how 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.509
 once you go through then you pull yourself 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.459
 your looks a bit deeper than usual 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:22.880
 would wear and then you share the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.110
 hair in three strands and the first 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.930
 track is like the very first one 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.630
 Hairstyle about from crest to behind 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.280
 the ear and then you divide the western 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.780
 hair on easy again in two 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.970
 strands off and then you start with it 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.530
 to weave the first strand again like 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.560
 at the very first hairstyle with one 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.780
 French braid divides the whole in 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.970
 three little strands on and take you 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.389
 always with the outer strands something h 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.780
 until the whole strand intertwined 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.180
 is 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.070
 then you take your remaining two 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.810
 strands and bad ones each too 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.190
 a normal braid then you have to 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.669
 do not make a French train 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.900
 maybe that just down and then 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.120
 you start with the three-headed soft 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.520
 Plane just acts like the 312 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.250
 normal strands and braids the 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.130
 to a relatively strict braid with it 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.169
 not so much sees these transitions and 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.150
 fix the whole thing with one 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.620
 Chewing gum and I will always be on it 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.409
 Talked about my hair like that 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.820
 wear because that's just a lot more exciting 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.050
 and complicated looks like 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.690
 actually in the making is that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.370
 all hairstyles were good for her 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.159
 I can carry the school 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.510
 hairstyles all very much in everyday life i 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.889
 I hope you liked the whole thing 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.820
 hope the whole back to school rhine 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.409
 like 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.729
 you can give me so times in comment 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.530
 Write like you all the whole 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.030
 Maybe I liked it more often 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.830
 to do times as topics home 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.479
 maybe also with other youtubers and 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.699
 if so what topics 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.380
 that would interest me and me 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.449
 I wish you a wonderful rest
