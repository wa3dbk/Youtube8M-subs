00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
you're going to be out we're going to be

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
you're going to be out we're going to be
watering<00:01:28.900> these<00:01:29.080> pots<00:01:29.770> thoroughly<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:31.510> ah

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
watering these pots thoroughly so ah

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.820 
watering these pots thoroughly so ah
there<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.520> go<00:01:33.870> that's<00:01:34.870> pretty<00:01:35.230> wet<00:01:35.470> if<00:01:35.650> you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
there you go that's pretty wet if you

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.450 
there you go that's pretty wet if you
can<00:01:35.980> see<00:01:36.160> there<00:01:36.430> it's<00:01:36.940> like<00:01:37.060> dripping<00:01:37.540> down<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
can see there it's like dripping down so

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.390 
can see there it's like dripping down so
so<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:40.630> looks<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.140> there's<00:01:41.410> only<00:01:41.530> half<00:01:41.710> a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
so it looks like there's only half a

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.460 
so it looks like there's only half a
container<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.659> sphagnum<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.230> that's<00:01:44.350> because

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
container of sphagnum but that's because

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.610 
container of sphagnum but that's because
I<00:01:44.770> compressed<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:45.820> much<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.409> really

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
I compressed it so much to get it really

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.470 
I compressed it so much to get it really
wet<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:48.159> lot<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.550> people<00:01:48.850> like<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.030> put<00:01:49.330> the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
wet a lot of people like to put the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.510 
wet a lot of people like to put the
sphagnum<00:01:49.659> really<00:01:50.230> compact<00:01:50.740> at<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.070> bottom

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
sphagnum really compact at the bottom

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.149 
sphagnum really compact at the bottom
this<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.360> one<00:01:52.540> technique<00:01:52.690> i<00:01:53.080> was<00:01:53.980> reading

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
this is one technique i was reading

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.490 
this is one technique i was reading
online<00:01:54.400> about<00:01:54.580> really<00:01:55.570> compact<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.260> bottom

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
online about really compact the bottom

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.830 
online about really compact the bottom
of<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.650> pot<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.040> then<00:01:57.130> less<00:01:57.370> compact<00:01:57.820> top<00:01:58.659> of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
of the pot and then less compact top of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.020 
of the pot and then less compact top of
the<00:01:58.900> pot<00:01:59.080> before<00:01:59.950> their<00:02:00.100> seedlings<00:02:00.640> i<00:02:03.030> really

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the pot before their seedlings i really

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.390 
the pot before their seedlings i really
don't<00:02:04.300> know<00:02:04.360> what<00:02:04.630> works<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:06.040> well<00:02:06.190> or<00:02:06.370> not

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
don't know what works that well or not

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.830 
don't know what works that well or not
i'm<00:02:06.940> just<00:02:07.000> gonna<00:02:07.270> put<00:02:07.810> spagnola<00:02:08.379> till<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
i'm just gonna put spagnola till it

put them in different areas of the pot

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.789 
put them in different areas of the pot
because<00:03:43.269> sometimes<00:03:44.200> really<00:03:44.440> look<00:03:44.590> better

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
because sometimes really look better

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.640 
because sometimes really look better
when<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.579> lot<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.850> them<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:50.170> let's

when you have a lot of them so let's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.030 
when you have a lot of them so let's
just<00:03:50.920> take<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.489> put<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.880> right<00:03:52.630> there

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
just take that and put that right there

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.770 
just take that and put that right there
