00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.270
 spread is 3 mm slices of paper 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 in the front 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.979
 so that these so-called home advises 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.079
 get which is still a light in 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.450
 have the chest and still holds it 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.409
 more taste does not get so tasty 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.409

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.130

 Pay attention that's really nice 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.490
 which is a pure blow so no 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 fill also no air in the ladies 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 because please pay attention that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.459
 the intestine is really nice here 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.490
 a damp sheet takes it right 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.709
 nice this slides a nice 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.509
 consistency assume there you because if it 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.759
 dry it sticks it everywhere 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 that's not all that great then catch it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.620
 Let's get started 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.840
 I now take the second aid 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 cameraman at home takes there your wife 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.329
 buddy from the berlin uncle and so on 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.299
 and then uniformly arranged in rows so 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.579
 fill so that's easy tension 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.769
 because it is not too strong because otherwise 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.769
 we also want to burst it 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.400
 there we are still turning off and if we are 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.280
 the turn 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.750
 he also gets too excited and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.230
 he would burst that we want 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.230
 of course not 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 succeeds only 20 centimeters so the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 nice hook solace that's what they look like 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.550
 I already have two ready for the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 next turn so a bit 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.650
 Press and turn 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.720
 unconsciously from a bit longer and longer 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.220
 the humor on the grill left i have 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.040
 Now here is a 50 50 grill method 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.130
 Prepared looks like a side 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.060
 The coal on the other side is a drop bowl 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.680
 Cover opening please about the drooff 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.160
 we are sorry to bring you to production 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.300
 to get 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.980
 We are now laying our sausages 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.080
 sometimes indirectly emphasize that liso 23 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.490
 minutes to warm briefly first and 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.860
 then we draw them over the direct 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.830
 heat and I will be really golden brown 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.440
 and just awesome 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.930
 please also cover the sausage 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.030
 Always close we use the top heat 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.410
 the heat so it rises upwardly through 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.820
 the lid is reflected back 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.160
 That's why we only need a sausage 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.810
 to turn once and now you see how 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.210
 the most easily the color 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.530
 has changed and now we pull the 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.750
 sausage over the direct heat now 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.520
 so wait one and a half two minutes 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.740
 if we do the exact same thing on the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.630
 other side calls the finished please 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.480
 pay attention when you open the lid 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.300
 Carefully tilt and then only after 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.740
 open at the back and that from the following 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.660
 if you pull it up too fast 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.030
 creates a so-called and pulls you the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.290
 relatively light ash up to yours 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.980
 Grillgut and of course we want there 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.980
 do not have clean 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:35.199
 It looks very cool 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:37.509
 Look at the point from the inside out 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.020
 the korean and also the chemistry has 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.020
 distributed nicely 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.370
 delicious super juicy a bit more 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.330
 hot but the korean comes good we 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.050
 have the lemon 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.470
 we got it really nice for you 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.569
 validity if the sausage you need 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.729
 ketchup or no must so juicy 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.860
 so aromatic a bit 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.389
 potatoes with a little salad 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.250
 still onions and you are on the 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.250
 right way just try it out
