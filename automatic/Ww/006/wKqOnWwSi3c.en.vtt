00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 hello today we'll talk about 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 vuqar one material most famous 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 as rabbis of material we have 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 film film pass light protects 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.859
 plant from the wind and partially saves 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.779
 heat 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.970
 plants under the film can bring 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.969
 freezing from minus 2 to minus 7 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.160
 degrees breathable and not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.989
 permits moisture so you need 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 periodically open air and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 water the plants until recently 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.420
 the film was the only assistant for 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 shelter greenhouses and greenhouses but not now 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.539
 besides the usual well-known film 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 there are reinforced film 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.120
 reinforced film is good because it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.760
 more strong in its structure there is a micro 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.760
 access holes 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.609
 oxygen to the plants so the plant 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 can not open do not air this 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.680
 durable film resistant to gusts 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 wind plus still breathing still exists 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 color conversion film 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 I consist of dyed microfiber 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.369
 which serve as a kind of filter for 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.670
 Sveta 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.189
 they convert the visible light spectrum to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 the spectrum of the plant you need because of this 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.560
 plants better photosynthesize better 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 develop also exists 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 air bubble film 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.810
 it consists of three layers of ordinary thin 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 plastic film between which 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.579
 there are air bubbles such a film 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 how air blanket possesses 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.299
 heat protection is 20 times higher than that of 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 single-layer covering materials and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.810
 good strength most 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.500
 efficiency now 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.930
 enjoy covering materials from 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.149
 nonwoven material they consist of 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.799
 polypropylene microtubules 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.290
 which is under high temperatures 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.660
 are fused outside hemp 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.610
 but such materials are well passed 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.010
 air light and moisture cold 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 protects against low temperatures in heat from 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.850
 overheating 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.600
 nonwoven materials are different in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.630
 thickness 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.960
 there are very thin they are intended 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.950
 in order to hide the beds above 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.430
 eat without any additional 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 the designs just hide gently 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.680
 fixed around the perimeter so the wind doesn't 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.380
 blew and all the top can be watered 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
 plants can not even open them there 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.720
 thick fat stuff about me 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.010
 used mainly on construction 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.200
 black covering material is not 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.840
 misses the sun's rays and blocks 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.680
 thereby growing weeds 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 nonwoven fabric can be used 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.190
 quite a long time order 3 4 5 seasons 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.720
 after you used it 1 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.760
 it must be taken off season 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.140
 neatly washed to dry 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 folded and can be stored until the next 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.450
 Season of all good bye 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.640
 good harvests
