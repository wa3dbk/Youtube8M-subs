00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.220
 the next stage of processing is application 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.809
 paraffin appropriate weather 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 when applying paraffin on a frosty 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 the weather needs most of it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.970
 remove with a plastic scraper before it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.400
 full hardening since it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 will become tough and will be 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.070
 chipping off a piece of ski leaving 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 large spaces without paraffin after 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.689
 final cooling of the ski 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.399
 the remaining paraffin removes hard 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.200
 synthetic brushed soft bar athens 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.270
 processed in a similar way for 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.750
 except that soft paraffin 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.989
 removed by scraper in completely cooled 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 condition consider an application method 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.690
 powdered ointments powder sprinkles thin 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.410
 layer over the entire sliding surface 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.320
 and then with the help of iron melted at 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 this melts the powder or accelerator 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 in one motion 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 when the iron moves slowly throughout 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.979
 the length of the ski 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 after cooling slippery surface 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.619
 skis are cleaned of excess powder when 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 natural brushing and grinding 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 paper so preparing skis 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.439
 to responsible competitions successful 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 races need to notice accelerators are those 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.479
 powders in cp drawing only 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 they are easier to use 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 grab skis and whip up 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 when not at hand became from the tank at 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.509
 it is not at all necessary to keep skis 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.310
 strictly horizontally do not be afraid 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.220
 wind that will blow away the powder with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.500
 skid surface 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.439
 compressed solid powder applied 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.600
 last very thin layer way 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.420
 processing can be both hot and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360
 cold hot way involves 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.270
 use of iron but between the sole 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.350
 iron and skis surface desirable 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.969
 have a layer of nonwoven material 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.580
 let's see carefully how to prepare for 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.979
 boat while preparing classic skis 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 after applying the powder on the ends of the skis 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.140
 be sure to remove that dust from the powder 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.020
 which inevitably falls on the block 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.020
 To do this, clear the block of residues 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.990
 powder and paraffins otherwise ointment from the pads 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.100
 will go very fast then 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.960
 we lift a waterproof emery cloth 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.950
 pile under the shoe if there is 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.880
 need 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.310
 for example when preparing skis for hard 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.950
 crystalline snow or ice then 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.910
 Put the primer in the ointment and only 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 thereafter 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.550
 ointment on hold dear skiers 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.610
 remember that when using liquid 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.030
 ointment pad should be shorter 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.350
 approximately 15-20 centimeters 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.690
 since the friction coefficient with 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.090
 snow in liquid ointments is much higher 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.550
 versus solid if you 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.820
 it took a different ointment plan 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.620
 or paraffin then you need to remove the previous ones 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.620
 previously applied layers of ointment
