00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
somebody will ask you what you did today

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.769 

I<00:00:17.920> think<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.490> training<00:00:18.850> of<00:00:18.910> guidance<00:00:19.270> and<00:00:19.660> all

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
I think the training of guidance and all

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.330 
I think the training of guidance and all
the<00:00:19.900> experience<00:00:20.350> I've<00:00:20.500> received<00:00:20.800> here<00:00:20.980> will

one of the best advantages to flying at
guidance<00:01:20.439> helicopters<00:01:21.159> if<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:21.789> learn<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.119> fly

guidance helicopters if you learn to fly
at<00:01:22.659> high<00:01:23.079> altitude<00:01:23.619> it's<00:01:24.189> more<00:01:24.429> challenging

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
at high altitude it's more challenging

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.080 
at high altitude it's more challenging
so<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:25.840> develop<00:01:26.259> habit<00:01:26.829> patterns<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.909> when

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
so you develop habit patterns so when

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.789 
so you develop habit patterns so when
you<00:01:28.149> end<00:01:28.359> up<00:01:28.509> flying<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.960> low<00:01:28.990> altitude<00:01:29.590> it's

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
you end up flying at low altitude it's

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.490 
you end up flying at low altitude it's
dramatically<00:01:30.429> easier

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
dramatically easier
