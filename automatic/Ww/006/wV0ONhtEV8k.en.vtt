think you know as as we keep them and
working<00:01:39.039> through<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.250> process<00:01:39.520> I'll<00:01:40.210> say<00:01:40.450> it

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
working through this process I'll say it

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.529 
working through this process I'll say it
again<00:01:40.600> takes<00:01:41.320> 21<00:01:41.740> days<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.610> don't<00:01:42.729> mentor<00:01:43.149> to

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
again takes 21 days you don't mentor to

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.540 
again takes 21 days you don't mentor to

towards<00:01:48.550> day<00:01:48.640> 21<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:50.350> think<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.770> kind<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.340> I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
towards day 21 you think that kind of I

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.210 
towards day 21 you think that kind of I
guess<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.569> issues<00:01:52.929> you've<00:01:53.110> seen<00:01:53.409> sort<00:01:54.069> of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
guess the issues you've seen sort of

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.499 
guess the issues you've seen sort of
with<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.490> guys<00:01:54.640> getting<00:01:55.000> off<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.179> blocks<00:01:55.390> you

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
with the guys getting off the blocks you

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.490 
with the guys getting off the blocks you
think<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.780> lot<00:01:55.929> of<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.140> has<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.259> do<00:01:56.380> with

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
think a lot of it has to do with

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.320 
think a lot of it has to do with
technique<00:01:56.860> right<00:01:57.069> now<00:01:57.250> guys<00:01:57.789> just<00:01:58.090> trying<00:01:58.179> to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
technique right now guys just trying to

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.700 
technique right now guys just trying to
sharpen<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.990> tape<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.500> all

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
fundamentals I think what happens is is

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.510 
fundamentals I think what happens is is
it's<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:02.140> one<00:02:02.380> thing<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.649> get<00:02:02.890> into<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> drill
