00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
at Crime Lab we originally came up with

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
at Crime Lab we originally came up with
an<00:00:25.980> age<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.310> about<00:00:26.580> four<00:00:26.910> million<00:00:27.150> years<00:00:27.510> for

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
an age of about four million years for

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
an age of about four million years for
that<00:00:27.869> fossil<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.439> seems<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.890> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.189> too

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that fossil which seems a little bit too

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
that fossil which seems a little bit too
old<00:00:29.660> other<00:00:30.660> people<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.109> worked<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> cave

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
old other people have worked at the cave

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.740 
old other people have worked at the cave
and<00:00:32.009> they've<00:00:32.130> come<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.550> younger<00:00:33.390> ages

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and they've come up with younger ages

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
and they've come up with younger ages
than<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.290> had<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> something<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
than we had and this is something that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.920 
than we had and this is something that
I've<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.550> wanted<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> solve<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> long

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I've really wanted to solve for a long

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.740 
I've really wanted to solve for a long
time<00:00:37.340> we've<00:00:38.340> tried<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> run<00:00:39.000> samples<00:00:39.570> from

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
time we've tried to run samples from

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.799 
time we've tried to run samples from
start<00:00:40.140> contain<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> years<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> brought

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
start contain over the years and brought

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
start contain over the years and brought
back<00:00:43.050> samples<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> site<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.640> bring<00:00:44.850> back

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
back samples from the site we bring back

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.920 
back samples from the site we bring back
rocks<00:00:45.469> we<00:00:46.469> brought<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:47.010> stone<00:00:47.910> tools<00:00:48.270> from

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
rocks we brought back stone tools from

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
rocks we brought back stone tools from
different<00:00:49.289> levels<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> cave<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.370> we've

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
different levels of the cave and we've

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.639 
different levels of the cave and we've
never<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.750> been<00:00:51.870> able<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.440> good

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
never really been able to get good

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.240 
never really been able to get good
results<00:00:52.860> until<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> year<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.039> have

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
results until just this year so we have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.090 
results until just this year so we have
samples<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.449> brought<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.530> right

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
samples that we brought back from right

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
samples that we brought back from right
around<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> skeleton<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.899> samples

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
around the skeleton and we have samples

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
around the skeleton and we have samples
of<00:01:01.440> stone<00:01:01.680> tools<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.219> higher<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of stone tools from higher up in the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.160 
of stone tools from higher up in the
cave<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:04.379> analyze<00:01:04.890> those<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.170> accelerator

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
cave we analyze those on the accelerator

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
cave we analyze those on the accelerator
here<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> new<00:01:07.799> gas<00:01:08.040> filled<00:01:08.310> magnet<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
here with the new gas filled magnet and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
here with the new gas filled magnet and
suddenly<00:01:09.780> were<00:01:09.900> able<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.590> measurements

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
suddenly were able to get measurements

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
suddenly were able to get measurements
what<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.939> weren't<00:01:12.180> able<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.570> report<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
what we weren't able to report and so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
what we weren't able to report and so
we're<00:01:14.100> able<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> show<00:01:14.760> now

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
we're able to show now

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
we're able to show now
with<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> high<00:01:16.530> degree<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> confidence<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.729> have

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
with a high degree of confidence we have

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.170 
with a high degree of confidence we have
a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> samples<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.649> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
a lot of samples here that the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
a lot of samples here that the
sentiments<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.899> skeleton<00:01:22.469> are

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sentiments around that skeleton are

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.319 
sentiments around that skeleton are
about<00:01:22.970> 3.6<00:01:23.970> 3.7<00:01:24.720> million<00:01:25.079> years<00:01:25.470> old<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> now

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
about 3.6 3.7 million years old so now

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.969 
about 3.6 3.7 million years old so now
we<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.079> really<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:28.590> age<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
we have a really good age for that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
we have a really good age for that
fossil<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.810> good<00:01:30.960> age<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
fossil we have a really good age for the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
fossil we have a really good age for the
flowstone<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.130> much<00:01:32.399> younger<00:01:32.729> around<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
flowstone that's much younger around it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
flowstone that's much younger around it
and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.289> we've<00:01:34.439> resolved<00:01:35.069> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and I think we've resolved the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.980 
and I think we've resolved the
controversy<00:01:36.240> around<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.659> age<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
controversy around the age of the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
controversy around the age of the
skeleton

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.870 

so<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.719> is<00:01:42.899> called<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.350> gas-filled<00:01:43.950> magnet

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so this is called a gas-filled magnet

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
so this is called a gas-filled magnet
the<00:01:45.240> big<00:01:46.049> blue<00:01:46.320> chamber<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the big blue chamber and then there's a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.399 
the big blue chamber and then there's a
smaller<00:01:47.880> cylindrical<00:01:48.479> blue<00:01:48.659> chamber<00:01:49.079> after

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
smaller cylindrical blue chamber after

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.510 
smaller cylindrical blue chamber after
that<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> detector<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:52.369> what<00:01:53.369> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that which is the detector and what this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.359 
that which is the detector and what this
does<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.210> us<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:55.020> us<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> allows<00:01:55.799> us<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
does for us for us as it allows us to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
does for us for us as it allows us to
separate<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.689> thing<00:01:57.929> we<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> measure

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
separate the thing we want to measure

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
separate the thing we want to measure
like<00:01:59.039> aluminum-26

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like aluminum-26

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.859 
like aluminum-26
from<00:02:01.259> interfering<00:02:02.220> ions<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.939> magnesium-26

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
from interfering ions like magnesium-26

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
from interfering ions like magnesium-26
and<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.560> turns<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.159> there'll<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and it turns out that there'll be a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
and it turns out that there'll be a
whole<00:02:05.819> lot<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.240> magnesium-26

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
whole lot more magnesium-26

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.499 
whole lot more magnesium-26
in<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.519> sample<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.179> there<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.450> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
in a sample then there will be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930 
in a sample then there will be
aluminum-26<00:02:10.259> by<00:02:11.009> many<00:02:11.340> many<00:02:11.580> orders<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
aluminum-26 by many many orders of

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.809 
aluminum-26 by many many orders of
magnitude<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.800> magnesium<00:02:14.370> gets

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
magnitude and so if that magnesium gets

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.509 
magnitude and so if that magnesium gets
into<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> detector<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.290> swamps<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.920> detector

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
into the detector it swamps the detector

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.830 
into the detector it swamps the detector
and<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.760> doesn't<00:02:18.030> let<00:02:18.209> us<00:02:18.330> see<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and it doesn't let us see the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.130 
and it doesn't let us see the
aluminum-26<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.940> sea<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.269> counts<00:02:21.989> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
aluminum-26 in this sea of counts of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.300 
aluminum-26 in this sea of counts of
magnesium-26

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
magnesium-26

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.259 
magnesium-26
so<00:02:24.000> by<00:02:24.299> running<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.019> beam<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> ions<00:02:26.549> into

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
so by running the beam or the ions into

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.330 
so by running the beam or the ions into
this<00:02:27.450> magnet<00:02:28.019> chamber<00:02:28.530> that's<00:02:28.799> filled<00:02:29.160> with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
this magnet chamber that's filled with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.910 
this magnet chamber that's filled with
about<00:02:30.209> eight<00:02:31.080> tor<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:32.450> nitrogen<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:34.349> this

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
about eight tor of nitrogen then this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.550 
about eight tor of nitrogen then this
allows<00:02:35.310> us<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:36.000> put<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.450> magnesium<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
allows us to put the magnesium and the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.600 
allows us to put the magnesium and the
aluminum<00:02:38.099> on<00:02:38.250> slightly<00:02:38.670> different<00:02:40.549> radii<00:02:41.549> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
aluminum on slightly different radii of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.509 
aluminum on slightly different radii of
curvature<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.290> aluminum-26<00:02:43.860> makes

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
curvature and so the aluminum-26 makes

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.949 
curvature and so the aluminum-26 makes
it<00:02:44.700> into<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.060> detector<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
it into the detector and the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.110 
it into the detector and the
magnesium-26<00:02:46.769> doesn't<00:02:47.459> make<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.730> into<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
magnesium-26 doesn't make it into the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
magnesium-26 doesn't make it into the
detector<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.829> have<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> nice<00:02:50.280> clean

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
detector so then we have a nice clean

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.870 
detector so then we have a nice clean
signal<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:52.049> unambiguous<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:53.609> we<00:02:53.760> know

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
signal it's unambiguous and we know

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.620 
signal it's unambiguous and we know
exactly<00:02:54.329> how<00:02:54.510> much<00:02:54.660> aluminum-26<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
exactly how much aluminum-26 is in the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.289 
exactly how much aluminum-26 is in the
is<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.959> sample<00:02:58.350> better<00:02:58.590> okay<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.160> as<00:03:00.060> it

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
is of a sample better okay so as it

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.819 
is of a sample better okay so as it
turns<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:00.690> one<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.049> reasons<00:03:01.139> I<00:03:01.410> came<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
turns out one of the reasons I came to

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.780 
turns out one of the reasons I came to
Purdue<00:03:03.019> 1314<00:03:04.019> years<00:03:04.290> ago<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:05.190> wanted<00:03:05.639> to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
Purdue 1314 years ago is I wanted to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.280 
Purdue 1314 years ago is I wanted to
work<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.109> I've<00:03:07.260> been

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
work on this this is what I've been

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.550 
work on this this is what I've been
wanting<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.220> for<00:03:08.900> probably<00:03:09.900> twenty<00:03:10.260> years

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
wanting to do for probably twenty years

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.460 
wanting to do for probably twenty years
so<00:03:11.010> we're<00:03:11.340> measuring<00:03:11.840> aluminum-26

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
so we're measuring aluminum-26

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.379 
so we're measuring aluminum-26
with<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.130> right<00:03:14.280> now<00:03:14.340> we're<00:03:14.819> successfully

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
with it right now we're successfully

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.420 
with it right now we're successfully
measuring<00:03:15.750> beryllium<00:03:16.109> ten<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.829> we're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
measuring beryllium ten with it we're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.210 
measuring beryllium ten with it we're
also<00:03:17.519> measuring<00:03:17.819> chlorine<00:03:18.269> 36<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.709> soon

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
also measuring chlorine 36 but as soon

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.129 
also measuring chlorine 36 but as soon
as<00:03:20.400> we<00:03:20.549> get<00:03:20.700> some<00:03:20.970> development<00:03:21.569> time<00:03:21.780> which<00:03:22.049> I

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
as we get some development time which I

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.270 
as we get some development time which I
hope<00:03:22.290> will<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> next<00:03:22.920> couple<00:03:23.100> of

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
hope will be in the next couple of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.069 
hope will be in the next couple of
months<00:03:23.430> we'll<00:03:23.970> start<00:03:24.239> measuring<00:03:24.540> even<00:03:24.930> other

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
months we'll start measuring even other

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.400 
months we'll start measuring even other
things<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.560> manganese<00:03:26.069> 53<00:03:26.940> perhaps<00:03:27.720> calcium

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
things like manganese 53 perhaps calcium

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.000 
things like manganese 53 perhaps calcium
41<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.510> idea<00:03:30.989> here<00:03:31.319> is<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.799> gives

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
41 and the idea here is that this gives

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.670 
41 and the idea here is that this gives
us<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> capability<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:33.359> does<00:03:33.900> not<00:03:34.109> exist<00:03:34.530> in

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
us a capability that does not exist in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.910 
us a capability that does not exist in
the<00:03:34.769> United<00:03:35.190> States<00:03:35.459> right<00:03:35.700> now
