00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.799 

Oh

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.160 

yes<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.290> this<00:00:15.440> basically<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:15.889> shaping<00:00:16.129> room

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
yes so this basically the shaping room

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.109 
yes so this basically the shaping room
I'll<00:00:18.170> just<00:00:18.320> kind<00:00:18.500> of<00:00:18.590> go<00:00:18.710> quickly<00:00:19.070> through<00:00:19.250> why

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
I'll just kind of go quickly through why

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.670 
I'll just kind of go quickly through why
it's<00:00:20.300> set<00:00:20.510> up<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.689> way<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:20.840> is<00:00:21.050> you'll<00:00:21.349> notice

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
it's set up the way it is you'll notice

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.580 
it's set up the way it is you'll notice
right<00:00:21.770> off<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.130> bat<00:00:22.340> with<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.640> boner<00:00:22.970> on<00:00:23.000> black

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
right off the bat with a boner on black

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.230 
right off the bat with a boner on black
some<00:00:24.590> shady<00:00:24.860> areas<00:00:25.130> will<00:00:25.250> be<00:00:25.279> dark<00:00:25.550> blue<00:00:25.820> or

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
some shady areas will be dark blue or

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.290 
some shady areas will be dark blue or
green<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.349> prefer<00:00:27.830> black<00:00:28.160> just<00:00:28.430> sharpest

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
green I prefer black just sharpest

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.330 
green I prefer black just sharpest
contrast<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.710> reason<00:00:31.010> that<00:00:31.039> is<00:00:31.310> is

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
contrast and the reason that is is

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.000 
contrast and the reason that is is
because<00:00:31.750> one<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.930> don't<00:00:33.019> want<00:00:33.110> light

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
because one you don't want light

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.369 
because one you don't want light
bouncing<00:00:34.519> around<00:00:34.610> too<00:00:35.330> much<00:00:35.510> we<00:00:35.900> rely<00:00:36.050> heavily

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
bouncing around too much we rely heavily

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.680 
bouncing around too much we rely heavily
on<00:00:36.830> shadows<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.760> contrast<00:00:38.269> between<00:00:38.449> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
on shadows and contrast between the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.200 
on shadows and contrast between the
white<00:00:38.809> foam<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.739> dark<00:00:39.980> walls<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.030> that's

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
white foam and the dark walls so that's

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.869 
white foam and the dark walls so that's
in<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.080> nutshell<00:00:42.110> why<00:00:42.589> the<00:00:42.650> Walter<00:00:42.980> black<00:00:43.220> that

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
in a nutshell why the Walter black that

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.660 
in a nutshell why the Walter black that
again<00:00:44.150> is<00:00:44.210> also<00:00:44.829> related<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.160> lights<00:00:46.399> and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
again is also related to the lights and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.540 
again is also related to the lights and
why<00:00:46.910> there's<00:00:47.120> good<00:00:47.570> right<00:00:47.750> here<00:00:48.129> they're<00:00:49.129> set

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
why there's good right here they're set

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.310 
why there's good right here they're set
up<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:49.879> they<00:00:50.059> cast<00:00:50.300> like<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:50.899> way<00:00:51.110> and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
up so that they cast like this way and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.500 
up so that they cast like this way and
nowhere<00:00:51.620> else<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.100> again<00:00:52.340> at<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.730> all<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.390> do

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
nowhere else and again at the all to do

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.119 
nowhere else and again at the all to do
with<00:00:53.539> casting<00:00:54.020> shadows<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:54.649> using<00:00:54.950> that<00:00:54.980> to

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
with casting shadows and using that to

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.299 
with casting shadows and using that to
really<00:00:56.079> see<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.230> different<00:00:57.530> contours<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
really see the different contours of a

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.970 
really see the different contours of a
surfboard<00:00:58.520> as<00:00:58.910> it's<00:00:59.059> being<00:00:59.239> shaped<00:00:59.829> but<00:01:00.829> what

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
surfboard as it's being shaped but what

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.650 
surfboard as it's being shaped but what
I<00:01:01.039> did<00:01:01.219> want<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.430> show<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:01.640> first<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.390> all<00:01:02.539> is

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
I did want to show you first of all is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.689 
I did want to show you first of all is
have<00:01:02.870> what<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.410> blank<00:01:03.739> even<00:01:03.980> looks<00:01:04.309> like<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.489> lot

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
have what a blank even looks like a lot

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.770 
have what a blank even looks like a lot
of<00:01:04.729> people<00:01:04.910> I<00:01:05.030> don't<00:01:05.239> really<00:01:05.360> have<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.570> chance

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
of people I don't really have a chance

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.359 
of people I don't really have a chance
to<00:01:05.960> see<00:01:06.110> what<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.259> circle<00:01:06.560> work<00:01:06.649> like<00:01:06.860> how

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
to see what a circle work like how

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.279 
to see what a circle work like how
surfboard<00:01:07.820> looks<00:01:08.060> before<00:01:08.300> it<00:01:08.539> even<00:01:08.660> started

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
surfboard looks before it even started

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.350 
surfboard looks before it even started
so<00:01:09.830> there's<00:01:09.979> two<00:01:10.130> different<00:01:10.280> types<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.910> blanks

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
so there's two different types of blanks

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.540 
so there's two different types of blanks
that<00:01:11.420> we<00:01:11.600> use<00:01:11.840> here<00:01:11.869> at<00:01:12.200> Walker<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.039> first<00:01:13.340> one

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
that we use here at Walker the first one

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.779 
that we use here at Walker the first one
being<00:01:14.740> polyurethane<00:01:15.740> black<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.399> that's<00:01:16.550> when

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
being polyurethane black and that's when

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.210 
being polyurethane black and that's when
this<00:01:16.910> is<00:01:17.149> essentially<00:01:17.959> it<00:01:18.709> kind<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.009> looks

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
this is essentially it kind of looks

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.740 
this is essentially it kind of looks
like<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.399> surfboard<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.300> know<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.599> got

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
like a surfboard you know it's got

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.889 
like a surfboard you know it's got
somewhat<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.709> a<00:01:21.950> looks<00:01:22.220> an<00:01:22.399> outline<00:01:22.789> and<00:01:23.030> the

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
somewhat of a looks an outline and the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.650 
somewhat of a looks an outline and the
actual<00:01:24.140> rocker<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:24.970> we<00:01:25.970> order<00:01:26.330> tell<00:01:26.569> the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
actual rocker so we order tell the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.169 
actual rocker so we order tell the
different<00:01:26.990> blanks<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.560> different<00:01:28.490> sizes<00:01:28.700> so

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
different blanks of different sizes so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.210 
different blanks of different sizes so
how<00:01:29.750> pinning<00:01:30.319> the<00:01:30.440> type<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.649> board<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.130> we

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
how pinning the type of board that we

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.460 
how pinning the type of board that we
want<00:01:31.429> to<00:01:31.490> use<00:01:31.550> or<00:01:32.000> want<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.599> have<00:01:32.750> vanished<00:01:33.110> out

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
want to use or want to have vanished out

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.559 
want to use or want to have vanished out
of<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.039> this<00:01:34.580> board<00:01:34.849> is<00:01:34.970> pretty<00:01:35.360> standard

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
of it so this board is pretty standard

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.680 
of it so this board is pretty standard
it's<00:01:35.959> 68<00:01:36.530> look<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.099> would<00:01:37.250> use<00:01:37.369> this<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.940> any

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's 68 look we would use this for any

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.219 
it's 68 look we would use this for any
board<00:01:39.020> from<00:01:39.259> like<00:01:39.530> six<00:01:39.890> out<00:01:40.479> even<00:01:41.479> up<00:01:41.569> to<00:01:41.690> 64

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
board from like six out even up to 64

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.460 
board from like six out even up to 64
like<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> short<00:01:42.830> board<00:01:43.009> basically<00:01:43.489> and<00:01:44.470> what

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
like a short board basically and what

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.550 
like a short board basically and what
this<00:01:45.649> has<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.090> course<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.349> wooden

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
this has in it of course is the wooden

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.740 
this has in it of course is the wooden
stringer<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:48.950> gives<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.880> blank<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.479> foam

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
stringer that gives the blank the foam

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020 
stringer that gives the blank the foam
and<00:01:50.899> self<00:01:51.140> rigidity<00:01:51.800> also<00:01:52.369> creates<00:01:52.700> center

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and self rigidity also creates center

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.730 
and self rigidity also creates center
line<00:01:53.209> for<00:01:53.599> us

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
line for us

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.359 
line for us
around<00:01:55.689> so<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:56.840> would<00:01:57.020> use<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.439> both<00:01:58.340> for

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
around so we would use this both for

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.370 
around so we would use this both for
hundreds<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.030> handshaking<00:01:59.570> which<00:01:59.930> we<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:00.259> use

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
hundreds of handshaking which we can use

ends up looking something like this and

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.199 
ends up looking something like this and
thanks<00:02:39.049> me<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.290> CA<00:02:39.500> requires<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.130> huge<00:02:41.060> amount

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
thanks me in CA requires a huge amount

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.170 
thanks me in CA requires a huge amount
of<00:02:41.480> work<00:02:41.540> has<00:02:41.989> been<00:02:42.019> done<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:43.340> machine<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
of work has been done on machine and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.130 
of work has been done on machine and
this<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.480> what<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.470> shaper<00:02:45.890> will<00:02:46.040> start<00:02:46.340> with

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
this is what the shaper will start with

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.340 
this is what the shaper will start with
so<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.530> out<00:02:48.709> might<00:02:48.950> sell<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.239> depth<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
so the out might sell the depth of the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.140 
so the out might sell the depth of the
bottom<00:02:51.709> contours<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> rocker<00:02:52.549> everything<00:02:53.060> is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
bottom contours the rocker everything is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.479 
bottom contours the rocker everything is
basically<00:02:53.330> set<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:55.069> requires

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
basically set now this just requires

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.479 
basically set now this just requires
about<00:02:55.819> 20<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.450> 30<00:02:56.660> minutes<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:58.069> shaping

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
about 20 to 30 minutes of and shaping

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.940 
about 20 to 30 minutes of and shaping
which<00:02:59.329> will<00:02:59.570> just<00:02:59.690> really<00:03:00.049> fine-tune<00:03:00.620> our<00:03:00.739> Z

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
which will just really fine-tune our Z

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.500 
which will just really fine-tune our Z
there's<00:03:01.190> some<00:03:01.340> small<00:03:01.609> ribs<00:03:01.850> here<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.359> will

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
there's some small ribs here that will

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.020 
there's some small ribs here that will
be<00:03:02.570> cleaned<00:03:02.900> up<00:03:03.109> and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.010 

really<00:03:07.030> find<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:08.380> sort<00:03:09.040> out<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.870> is

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
really find to sort out so this is

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.140 
really find to sort out so this is
really<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.650> cool<00:03:12.070> thing<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.640> shaped<00:03:12.880> world

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
really a cool thing in the shaped world

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.540 
really a cool thing in the shaped world
as<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.750> know<00:03:13.810> we<00:03:14.080> start<00:03:14.380> off<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> lot<00:03:15.520> less

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
as you know we start off with a lot less

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.840 
as you know we start off with a lot less
grunt<00:03:16.390> work<00:03:16.650> involved<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:18.220> we<00:03:18.340> made<00:03:18.640> more

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
grunt work involved so we made more

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.580 
grunt work involved so we made more
border<00:03:19.150> pranay<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.900> them<00:03:20.020> be<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.410> lot

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
border pranay and have them be a lot

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890 
border pranay and have them be a lot
higher<00:03:20.770> quality<00:03:21.340> or<00:03:21.610> as<00:03:21.760> far<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.060> accuracy<00:03:22.330> or

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
higher quality or as far as accuracy or

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.260 
higher quality or as far as accuracy or
the<00:03:23.770> finished<00:03:24.160> product<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.670> what<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:24.970> blank

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
the finished product of what that blank

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.430 
the finished product of what that blank
would<00:03:25.420> look<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.960> in<00:03:28.960> seeing<00:03:29.320> out

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
would look like is this in seeing out

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.200 
would look like is this in seeing out
it's<00:03:29.590> got<00:03:29.710> a<00:03:29.770> lot<00:03:29.980> more<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.340> refined<00:03:30.670> look<00:03:30.970> to

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
it's got a lot more of a refined look to

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.770 
it's got a lot more of a refined look to
it<00:03:32.580> everything's<00:03:33.580> set<00:03:33.910> up<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.300> basically<00:03:34.630> we

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
it everything's set up and basically we

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.030 
it everything's set up and basically we
would<00:03:34.900> take<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.620> straight<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
would take this and go straight to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.880 
would take this and go straight to
glassy<00:03:36.610> this<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.540> use<00:03:37.959> different<00:03:38.350> varying

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
glassy this and we use different varying

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.500 
glassy this and we use different varying
degrees<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.190> sandpaper<00:03:39.670> things<00:03:40.180> like<00:03:40.330> that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
degrees of sandpaper things like that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.620 
degrees of sandpaper things like that
and<00:03:41.130> get<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.250> down<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.760> obviously

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
and get it down to this obviously

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.150 
and get it down to this obviously
there's<00:03:43.840> some<00:03:44.230> years<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.650> experience<00:03:45.040> that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
there's some years of experience that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.880 
there's some years of experience that
are<00:03:45.190> required<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.580> make<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.880> happen<00:03:46.240> but<00:03:46.890> that

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
are required to make it happen but that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.270 
are required to make it happen but that
in<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.280> nutshell<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.880> kind<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.150> process<00:03:49.690> of

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
in a nutshell it's kind of process of

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.160 
in a nutshell it's kind of process of
changing<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.340> link<00:03:52.030> into<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.570> beautiful

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
changing the link into a beautiful
