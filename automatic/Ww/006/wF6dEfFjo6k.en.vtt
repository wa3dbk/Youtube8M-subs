00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.080
 brilliant discovery of scientists who, like

 meaning time beauty comes from within means 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.880
 need a lot of attention paid to the fact that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.770
 goes inside don't want to stand then 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 listen to accounting from 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 that the aging process was not that 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.369
 other than the inflammatory process in our 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.140
 cages 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.200
 it is she who is the cause 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 premature aging wrinkles in general and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.960
 many ailments and destroys subcutaneously 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.509

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.780
 beauty and youth and not just for the skin 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.090

 need to tell you about 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 how important is collagen to female 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.450
 skin and for the whole body by virtue of our 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.670
 unclean ecology of our skin and so 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.000
 exposed to many harmful 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.120
 exposure to it every day and if 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.030
 we do not have the power to change the ecology like this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 Immediately we can easily change

 the first thing we do is get rid of 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.769

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.579
 Eat sunflower seeds like 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.120
 can be more fresh vegetables especially with 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.799
 dark green and rich color 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.480

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.829

 believe seasonal berries and fruits in winter 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.400
 will be much more useful land than darker 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.090
