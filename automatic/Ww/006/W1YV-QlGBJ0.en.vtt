have<00:04:32.550> been<00:04:32.580> using<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.870> one<00:04:34.080> or<00:04:34.230> two<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.440> four

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
have been using just one or two of four

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.730 
have been using just one or two of four
years<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.550> really<00:04:36.060> expensive<00:04:36.420> gear<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.530> not

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
years on really expensive gear so not

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.130 
years on really expensive gear so not
only<00:04:37.890> do<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.160> have<00:04:38.250> filters<00:04:38.910> but<00:04:39.570> we<00:04:39.660> have<00:04:39.840> all

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
only do we have filters but we have all

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.500 
only do we have filters but we have all
the<00:04:40.560> other<00:04:40.680> digital<00:04:41.130> DJing<00:04:41.550> effects<00:04:42.030> which

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the other digital DJing effects which

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.080 
the other digital DJing effects which
are<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:42.840> tied<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.010> beat<00:04:44.220> automatically

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
are now tied to the beat automatically

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.630 
are now tied to the beat automatically
so<00:04:45.240> they<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.630> sound<00:04:45.960> better<00:04:46.170> anyway<00:04:46.980> and

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
so they just sound better anyway and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.520 
so they just sound better anyway and
then<00:04:47.850> we've<00:04:47.970> got<00:04:48.120> hot<00:04:48.390> cues<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.930> loops<00:04:49.200> and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
then we've got hot cues and loops and

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.530 
then we've got hot cues and loops and
multiple<00:04:50.040> decks<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.700> can<00:04:50.850> chop<00:04:51.090> things<00:04:51.300> up

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
multiple decks so you can chop things up

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.420 
multiple decks so you can chop things up
and<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.750> can<00:04:51.900> have<00:04:51.990> samples<00:04:52.500> running<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
and you can have samples running all the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.840 
and you can have samples running all the
time<00:04:53.760> or<00:04:54.060> beat<00:04:54.750> matched<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.610> things

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
time or beat matched so just the things

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.340 
time or beat matched so just the things
you<00:04:57.030> can<00:04:57.180> do<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.510> fun<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:57.990> have<00:04:58.020> with

your gear you start hacking it and you
start<00:05:10.020> hacking<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.860> mappings<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.580> come

start hacking the mappings that come

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.940 
start hacking the mappings that come
with<00:05:11.970> your<00:05:12.000> software<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:12.990> order<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.440> get<00:05:13.860> the
