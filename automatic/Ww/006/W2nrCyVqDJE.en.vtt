redesigns that actually make sense

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.930 
redesigns that actually make sense
another<00:03:02.690> thing<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.980> know<00:03:04.100> breaks<00:03:04.400> people

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
another thing you know breaks people

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.280 
another thing you know breaks people
don't<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.390> know<00:03:05.480> take<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> time<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.170> think

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
don't you know take the time to think

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.860 
don't you know take the time to think
about<00:03:06.380> breaks<00:03:06.799> now<00:03:07.430> Hollett<00:03:08.180> has<00:03:08.570> always

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
about breaks now Hollett has always

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.680 
about breaks now Hollett has always
given<00:03:09.200> us<00:03:09.640> ABS<00:03:10.640> brakes<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.120> standard<00:03:11.480> things

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
given us ABS brakes the standard things

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.440 
given us ABS brakes the standard things
but<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.320> smart<00:03:12.860> engineers<00:03:13.280> at<00:03:13.459> Honda<00:03:13.489> they

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
but the smart engineers at Honda they

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.449 
but the smart engineers at Honda they
deemed<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.810> fit<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.230> install<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.830> system<00:03:16.100> called

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
deemed it fit to install a system called

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.360 
deemed it fit to install a system called
electronic<00:03:17.150> brake<00:03:17.510> distribution<00:03:17.860> now<00:03:18.860> when

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
electronic brake distribution now when

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.650 
electronic brake distribution now when
the<00:03:19.430> electronic<00:03:19.760> brake<00:03:20.000> distribution<00:03:20.180> is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the electronic brake distribution is

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.330 
the electronic brake distribution is
going<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.840> do<00:03:20.989> for<00:03:21.170> us<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.950> going<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.250> help

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
going to do for us is it's going to help

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.150 
going to do for us is it's going to help
us<00:03:22.519> maintain<00:03:22.700> control<00:03:23.239> over<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.510> car<00:03:23.780> by

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
us maintain control over the car by

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.340 
us maintain control over the car by
doing<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:25.790> when<00:03:26.299> we<00:03:26.450> apply<00:03:26.810> brake

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
doing this so when we apply brake

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.590 
doing this so when we apply brake
pressure<00:03:27.640> all<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.700> momentum<00:03:29.239> in<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> car

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
pressure all the momentum in the car

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.560 
pressure all the momentum in the car
wants<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.959> slam<00:03:30.620> forward<00:03:31.160> what<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.180> does<00:03:32.390> is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
wants to slam forward what that does is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.970 
wants to slam forward what that does is
it<00:03:32.690> makes<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.930> car<00:03:33.140> do<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.320> nosedive

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
it makes the car do a nosedive

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.280 
it makes the car do a nosedive
so<00:03:34.579> what<00:03:34.790> electronic<00:03:35.480> brake<00:03:35.660> distribution<00:03:35.780> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
so what electronic brake distribution is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.720 
so what electronic brake distribution is
going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> do<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.739> going<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:36.950> apply<00:03:37.130> more<00:03:37.430> rear

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
going to do is going to apply more rear

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.580 
going to do is going to apply more rear
brake<00:03:37.940> pressure<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.810> level<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.200> car<00:03:39.440> out

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
brake pressure to level the car out

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.009 
brake pressure to level the car out
under<00:03:39.860> severe<00:03:40.130> braking<00:03:40.549> again<00:03:41.239> now<00:03:41.480> why<00:03:41.959> do

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
under severe braking again now why do

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.110 
under severe braking again now why do
you<00:03:42.170> why<00:03:42.320> do<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.530> care<00:03:42.799> well<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.579> car<00:03:43.940> that's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
you why do you care well a car that's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.750 
you why do you care well a car that's
level<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:45.110> easy<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.620> control<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.519> number

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
level is easy to control and the number

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.280 
level is easy to control and the number
two<00:03:46.940> thing<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.329> is<00:03:47.420> going<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.989> if

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
two thing that is going to do is if

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.199 
two thing that is going to do is if
there<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.829> gonna<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.160> collision<00:03:49.430> it's<00:03:50.000> gonna

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
there is gonna be a collision it's gonna

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.880 
there is gonna be a collision it's gonna
pull<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.570> front<00:03:50.840> bumper<00:03:51.019> up<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.769> those

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
pull that front bumper up so that those

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.440 
pull that front bumper up so that those
airbag<00:03:52.310> cinches<00:03:52.700> are<00:03:52.820> in<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.940> right<00:03:53.090> position

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
airbag cinches are in the right position

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.300 
airbag cinches are in the right position
to<00:03:53.480> deploy<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.470> do<00:03:54.590> have<00:03:54.769> an<00:03:54.890> accident

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
to deploy if we do have an accident

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.330 
to deploy if we do have an accident
I<00:03:55.370> know<00:03:56.239> this<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.720> sport<00:03:57.050> model<00:03:57.170> but<00:03:58.040> Honda

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
I know this is the sport model but Honda

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.890 
I know this is the sport model but Honda
can't<00:03:58.550> get<00:03:58.700> away<00:03:58.819> from<00:03:58.940> being<00:03:59.239> fuel-efficient

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
can't get away from being fuel-efficient

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.210 
can't get away from being fuel-efficient
it's<00:04:00.050> just<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.349> their<00:04:00.500> blood<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.099> their

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
it's just in their blood it's in their

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.030 
it's just in their blood it's in their
DNA<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.750> course<00:04:02.930> they<00:04:03.110> created<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.590> fun<00:04:03.830> car

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
DNA so of course they created a fun car

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.510 
DNA so of course they created a fun car
to<00:04:04.069> drive<00:04:04.340> but<00:04:04.640> they've<00:04:05.120> also<00:04:05.330> created<00:04:05.660> a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
to drive but they've also created a

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.410 
to drive but they've also created a
fuel-efficient<00:04:07.520> car<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.910> they'd<00:04:08.209> like<00:04:08.360> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
fuel-efficient car and they'd like to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.630 
fuel-efficient car and they'd like to
teach<00:04:08.690> us<00:04:08.870> how<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.020> be<00:04:09.260> fuel-efficient<00:04:09.890> so<00:04:10.370> in

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
teach us how to be fuel-efficient so in

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.000 
teach us how to be fuel-efficient so in
our<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:10.849> made<00:04:11.270> if<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.260> take<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> look<00:04:12.739> here<00:04:12.800> we

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
our I made if you take a look here we

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.370 
our I made if you take a look here we
have<00:04:13.220> an<00:04:13.310> instant<00:04:13.610> fuel<00:04:13.790> guide<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.690> once<00:04:15.230> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
have an instant fuel guide so once the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.930 
have an instant fuel guide so once the
car<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.650> in<00:04:15.739> Drive<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.370> going<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.669> give<00:04:16.790> you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
car is in Drive that's going to give you

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.819 
car is in Drive that's going to give you
a<00:04:16.970> real-time<00:04:17.630> account<00:04:18.019> of<00:04:18.200> what<00:04:18.380> you're<00:04:18.530> doing

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
a real-time account of what you're doing

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.310 
a real-time account of what you're doing
on<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.070> throttle<00:04:19.459> as<00:04:19.579> you're<00:04:20.239> driving<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:20.870> you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
on the throttle as you're driving if you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.379 
on the throttle as you're driving if you
follow<00:04:21.590> your<00:04:21.769> eyes<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> left<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.120> have

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
follow your eyes to the left so we have

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.000 
follow your eyes to the left so we have
an<00:04:23.540> instant<00:04:23.840> fuel<00:04:24.020> got<00:04:24.200> there<00:04:24.500> but<00:04:24.740> we<00:04:24.830> also

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
an instant fuel got there but we also

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.950 
an instant fuel got there but we also
have<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.669> here<00:04:25.700> depending<00:04:26.240> upon<00:04:26.360> how<00:04:26.630> we<00:04:26.690> want

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
have it here depending upon how we want

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.750 
have it here depending upon how we want
to<00:04:27.020> manage<00:04:27.139> our<00:04:27.440> information<00:04:27.950> but<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.430> really

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
to manage our information but a really

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.070 
to manage our information but a really
cool<00:04:28.970> thing<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.240> Honda's<00:04:29.660> starting<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.990> do

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
cool thing that Honda's starting to do

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.930 
cool thing that Honda's starting to do
with<00:04:30.229> all<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.560> their<00:04:30.680> cars<00:04:30.919> if<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.700> take<00:04:31.910> a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
with all of their cars if you take a

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.340 
with all of their cars if you take a
look<00:04:32.120> at<00:04:32.270> these<00:04:32.360> little<00:04:32.540> green<00:04:32.900> rings<00:04:33.139> right

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
look at these little green rings right

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.140 
look at these little green rings right
here<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.680> outside<00:04:34.070> when<00:04:34.669> I'm<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> bad

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
here on the outside when I'm a bad

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.240 
here on the outside when I'm a bad
driver<00:04:35.389> it's<00:04:35.840> gonna<00:04:36.050> let<00:04:36.229> me<00:04:36.410> know<00:04:36.590> it's<00:04:37.040> going

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
driver it's gonna let me know it's going

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.340 
driver it's gonna let me know it's going
to<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:37.430> from<00:04:37.639> green<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.330> white<00:04:38.479> let<00:04:39.110> me<00:04:39.200> know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
to go from green to white let me know

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.930 
to go from green to white let me know
that<00:04:39.380> I'm<00:04:39.620> not<00:04:39.680> managing<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.400> throttle<00:04:40.729> fuel

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
that I'm not managing the throttle fuel

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.370 
that I'm not managing the throttle fuel
efficiently<00:04:41.330> see<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.110> get<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.290> to

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
efficiently see if I can get it to

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.990 
efficiently see if I can get it to
happen<00:04:42.530> here<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:42.889> now<00:04:43.160> it's<00:04:43.340> gone<00:04:43.460> white<00:04:43.729> so

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
happen here so now it's gone white so

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.850 
happen here so now it's gone white so
the<00:04:44.180> car<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.450> basically<00:04:44.630> saying<00:04:45.080> hey<00:04:45.320> you're

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the car is basically saying hey you're

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.320 
the car is basically saying hey you're
not<00:04:45.979> managing<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.550> throttle<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.060> a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
not managing the throttle in a

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.570 
not managing the throttle in a
fuel-efficient<00:04:47.960> way<00:04:48.130> with<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.220> Honda<00:04:49.400> Accord

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
fuel-efficient way with the Honda Accord

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.850 
fuel-efficient way with the Honda Accord
sport<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:50.570> don't<00:04:50.720> sacrifice<00:04:51.020> fuel

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
sport you don't sacrifice fuel

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.129 
sport you don't sacrifice fuel
efficiency<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:52.370> performance<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.810> one<00:04:53.990> thing

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
efficiency for performance so one thing

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.170 
efficiency for performance so one thing
that<00:04:54.169> Honda<00:04:54.530> has<00:04:54.650> done<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:55.100> barred<00:04:55.790> from<00:04:55.880> its

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
that Honda has done is barred from its

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.330 
that Honda has done is barred from its
hybrid<00:04:56.450> technology<00:04:57.110> what<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:57.710> have<00:04:57.950> over<00:04:58.190> here

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
hybrid technology what we have over here

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.130 
hybrid technology what we have over here
to<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.580> left<00:04:58.790> that<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.000> B<00:04:59.360> by<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.780> steering

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
to the left that the B by the steering

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.050 
to the left that the B by the steering
wheel<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.950> an<00:05:01.130> econ<00:05:01.460> button<00:05:01.490> which<00:05:02.030> is

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
wheel is an econ button which is

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.580 
wheel is an econ button which is
something<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.539> we<00:05:02.660> borrowed<00:05:03.020> from<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.289> Hama

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
something that we borrowed from the Hama

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.620 
something that we borrowed from the Hama
insight<00:05:04.100> so<00:05:04.820> it's<00:05:04.940> going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> change<00:05:05.360> three

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
insight so it's going to change three

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.600 
insight so it's going to change three
functions<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.229> car<00:05:06.470> first<00:05:07.250> thing<00:05:07.460> that

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
functions in the car first thing that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.400 
functions in the car first thing that
it's<00:05:07.729> going<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.910> do<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.780> going<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.080> push<00:05:09.260> the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
it's going to do is going to push the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.020 
it's going to do is going to push the
car<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.680> shift<00:05:09.890> earlier<00:05:10.250> through<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.580> RPM

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
car to shift earlier through the RPM

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.659 
car to shift earlier through the RPM
range<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:12.590> second<00:05:13.010> thing<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.490> going

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
range the second thing that it's going

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.000 
range the second thing that it's going
to<00:05:13.729> do<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.120> it's<00:05:14.690> going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.930> deny<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.710> heating

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
to do is it's going to deny the heating

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.040 
to do is it's going to deny the heating
and<00:05:16.100> air<00:05:16.250> condition<00:05:16.669> some<00:05:16.970> electricity<00:05:17.390> so

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
and air condition some electricity so

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.390 
and air condition some electricity so
it's<00:05:18.200> going<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.410> dumb<00:05:18.620> down<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.950> power<00:05:19.160> that

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it's going to dumb down the power that

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.370 
it's going to dumb down the power that
those<00:05:19.580> systems<00:05:19.970> use<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.960> third<00:05:21.200> thing

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
those systems use and the third thing

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.310 
those systems use and the third thing
that<00:05:21.440> it's<00:05:21.680> going<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:21.919> do<00:05:22.070> is<00:05:22.310> it's<00:05:22.610> gonna

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
that it's going to do is it's gonna

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.690 
that it's going to do is it's gonna
delay<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.560> throttle<00:05:24.919> body<00:05:25.010> throttle<00:05:25.490> bodies
