00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 well we are in random mods 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.080
 let's see a mod that adds one now 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.969
 we are in 1.7 point 10 by the way 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 adds a man who is also very 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 big but it 's pretty cool what 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 first let's look at the man as you 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.320
 full rabbin look perfect there you are 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.080
 seeing 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'm here giving my worst is that until the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.039
 name they say 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.650
 but the point is that we are like 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.900
 looking at my theory but in gravel 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.110
 also and that it was also for the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.390
 ethical duty but good let's go to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 do tests worth let's try 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.010
 I 'm supposed to be now and he lets go 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.360
 other smells but there's even 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.330
 probability that you release us diamond 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.500
 then to try look perfect diamond 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.100
 I do not always loose because I was 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 doing tests 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.910
 with the milk I had not had anything left 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.449
 over here 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.930
 I'm not sure but now we're going to 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.460
 eliminate everything 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.160
 but as you can see it costs us a lot of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.350
 things are quite waiting and as I say 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.060
 not always because at least not to me before 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.740
 more are all always but sometimes 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.820
 also loose diamond 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.000
 the results are worth 1 gold 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.540
 3 carbon zinc or lapis lazuli 1 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.970
 iron and 2 of rest we go to another more 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.000
 yes seemed turned up we're going to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.520
 chop a few as you see not always 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 comes out diamond is his thing too because 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 if you can not imagine and iron and gold comes out 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.180
 least look at lapis lazuli and 14 we have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 in total coal 10 rector 11 but the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.480
 iron and gold 6 and 7 loose less also 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.820
 is that if I let go of God 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.560
 I would not molar 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.090
 no no can not diamond we are not going to put them 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.090
 here to watch that it does not come serious 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.840
 do not lift for now has not come out 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.620
 in gravel as it costs more let's 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.910
 stop with a shovel as it is supposed to be 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.750
 gravel 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 similar to three diamond diamonds 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 do not 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.840
 hurt 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.000
 it is assumed that with dating we can not 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.000
 catch this this order 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.920
 let's remove everything 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.300
 yes but we have only taken three diamonds 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.640
 we continue we have asked for a lot but as 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.810
 you see 36 iron 41 gold that can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.520
 be very epic 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.010
 over here that is that ramin is a 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.849
 bit weird 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.860
 but that also does not but diamonds only 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.200
 13 voucher 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.310
 it's a super wall and I've put 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.170
 efficiency 10 at the peak 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.370
 because what I want to buy is how much 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.350
 diamond can let go 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.980
 mania that rain of hours not 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.980
 look 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.060
 or the great society 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.370
 because carlos the days so fast that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.170
 a lot of 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.170
 worse you up your newspaper 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.349
 and all that 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.790
 but the only thing that does not enter now is 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.790
 who enters is a 15th day just seriously 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.599
 OK 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.000
 OK 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.900
 go 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.110
 31 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.560
 31 of advances but look at everything else 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.440
 what is this we are going to leave the 30 before 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.220
 around here but god 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.220
 do not get too close to anything 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.819
 we eliminate everything 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.819
 let's pick up again 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.040
 9 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.140
 31 orb diamonds that is his thing too 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.920
 Do not jump too much diamonds but 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.920
 I wanted to do to avoid 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.060
 your watch to all this 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.150
 we go 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.510
 let's finish collecting it all and 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.510
 can be 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.770
 and coal 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.770
 and here some little things 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.729
 finished this is of almost two 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:41.580
 inventories does not reach 31 diamonds alone 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.979
 it's cool about all carbon lapis lazuli 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.710
 and rest 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.889
 but hey this is the curio acs del 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.279
 random and worse is called in fact that is 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.219
 like random gold not the third one was 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:58.259
 you ask the description is for 1.7 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.559
 punto dÃ­az is installed with forge etc as 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.559
 forever
