00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
fate was sealed a lot earlier I think

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.060 
fate was sealed a lot earlier I think
when<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.570> first<00:02:50.900> heard<00:02:51.140> Chet<00:02:51.440> Atkins<00:02:51.560> an<00:02:51.860> old

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
when I first heard Chet Atkins an old

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.510 
when I first heard Chet Atkins an old
Travis<00:02:52.340> play<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.680> wanted<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> play<00:02:55.340> like

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.540 
Travis play and I wanted to play like
that<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.880> badly<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.480> think<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.280> set<00:02:58.280> me<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.430> a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
that so badly I think that set me on a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.180 
that so badly I think that set me on a
course<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.930> along<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.350> way<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.710> wasn't<00:03:00.860> just
