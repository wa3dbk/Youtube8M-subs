00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
pump you look for a desktop on the top

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.360 
pump you look for a desktop on the top
here<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.500> put<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.709> back<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.950> okay

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.789 
here and you can put that back up okay
the<00:02:21.519> little<00:02:21.610> piece<00:02:21.790> desktop<00:02:22.530> which<00:02:23.530> will<00:02:23.650> also

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the little piece desktop which will also

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.710 
the little piece desktop which will also
match<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.280> piece<00:02:24.459> SF<00:02:25.360> stopped<00:02:25.569> it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
match with this piece SF stopped it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.780 
match with this piece SF stopped it
because<00:02:25.959> he<00:02:26.080> just<00:02:26.260> stopped<00:02:26.830> there<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.670> will

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
because he just stopped there this will

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.729 
because he just stopped there this will
go<00:02:27.879> to<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.000> top<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.269> your<00:02:28.330> motor<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.780> then<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
go to the top of your motor and then you

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.550 
go to the top of your motor and then you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
first part of sealing the second part of

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.119 
first part of sealing the second part of
the<00:02:34.180> seal<00:02:34.330> goes<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:34.930> your<00:02:35.049> inhaler<00:02:35.319> okay<00:02:35.980> I've
