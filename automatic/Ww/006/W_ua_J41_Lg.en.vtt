 very good a user of gta forums 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 called n kachelmann has discovered the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 game files a few models that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 could match perfectly with ones 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.489
 new garages for the mansions that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 could come out in the new tlc 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 that like yesterday after a news goes to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 leave in the month of July is yes yes no 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 you have seen the previous news you can 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 watch the previous video as you know 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 I'm bringing a daily video for 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 gather all the information and you have 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.750
 with images and inside information 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.930
 how are you seeing right now could 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 leave these mansions this garage already 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 we have the images I'm going to leave 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.930
 in the description image number one and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 we the number two I will comment with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.449
 you are worth when I say image 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 number one 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.750
 you look at lauro you know that in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.870
 the videos I can not put the images 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.940
 the strike strike reason is worth 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.620
 part of youtube or by rockstar 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.650
 but I'll leave it in the description and 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.390
 you look at the garage in the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.979
 images we can see that that garage is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 larger than the current 10- seater 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.460
 that we have right now and that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 it also has another different way we 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.950
 let's go to image number 1 as 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.260
 taking in the image number 1 appears 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.760
 in a very different way there is a 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.950
 shape that comes in the left part 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.110
 that we can enter now for a sunset 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 to load I'm going to teach it and I think it's going 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.259
 to make much bigger than the one that 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 We have 10 seats right now 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.090
 you know that the mansions are very big 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 gta iv if we had the luxor or we have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 had also the helicopter that is worth 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.380
 10 million luxor 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.479
 the helicopter is worth 5 million and a half 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 the vehicles have been quite clear 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.990
 now we can have some mansions 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 why do not you already know that many users 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 they say we want to have the jetpack we want 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.320
 have the casino there are many people who 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.050
 says they're going to leave the casino I think 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.270
 that you can possibly and this is a 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.729
 rumor there is nothing confirmed that they go to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.530
 leaving the islands mansions is worth it because 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 we want some mansions we do not want anymore 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.440
 leave our apartment of 500 thousand 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.060
 Dollars 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.430
 with our apartment of 100 thousand 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 dollars and we want to have a mansion that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.000
 they are going to have our pool 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.250
 have everything everything and a good garage 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.870
 It's worth a mansion in the first image 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.030
 as he had said at the entrance of the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
 garage ok let's go to the second hour 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.230
 and let's see the one on the top 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.850
 as it would be a kind of tunnel that is 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.860
 where we would enter the mansion and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.050
 we would enter through the tunnel and enter 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.360
 to the garage let's go to the image number 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.780
 3 in image number 3 we are seeing 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.940
 a block of dif not a block of 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.490
 building would be the internal part of the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.260
 garage in which there will be a block and for 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.240
 there we will enter by the bet to the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.310
 elevator or to the front door to the 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 house we still do not know but they are the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
 third image we enter the fourth 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.060
 picture the fourth picture how are you 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.390
 seeing they look a lot like the entrance of the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.100
 building elevator of 500 thousand but no 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.350
 we know if it's a door or a lift 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.450
 up so we see that he has a pilot 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.030
 black that can be to mark the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.280
 numbers that we are going to go or that we go to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.410
 enter or at least and it is already free in 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.239
 green or if it's busy in red it's worth 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.350
 well we do not know yet a 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.030
 lift 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.570
 but what we do know that would be the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.830
 entrance and exit for the building 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.720
 let's go to the next image and we're 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.670
 seeing the tunnel that we have seen from the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.560
 top part but now inside 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.450
 as having from the inside to the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.460
 seem on the walls it seems that they are 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.920
 concrete so it may be a 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.750
 building or maybe it 's a mansion 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.490
 you the comments house me 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.350
 you can leave whatever you want because as 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.780
 you are seeing these images are from the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.280
 game files and they are true 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.250
 as you are seeing we are also here 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.990
 from the inside part with one more 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.880
 texture because as having has some 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.740
 beams a fixed side an Africa in 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.840
 the top part and from here you see 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.610
 quite well as in the middle and we have 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.830
 also to be able to enter and you see 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.260
 pretty good that is a garage worth here 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.330
 I think this is going to be the entrance and that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.690
 when we have the entrance we will have 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.390
 a garage not far from here as it is 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.340
 going on the next image we are 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.950
 seeing the entrance door is worth the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.050
 gateway to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.660
 the mansion we can call the mansion 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.310
 here we can enter we can leave and as 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.780
 we are seeing everything is already created 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.480
 because all this is the archives of the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.250
 game within the game is not that 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.230
 out of the game is not inside the game 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.010
 and if he's in the game somewhere 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.930
 moment in some dlc they have to take out what 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.900
 that we can least expect to be taken out 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.960
 in the dlc of dirty money part 2 and that 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.370
 put us 20 million for a mansion 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.020
 as I think it's going to be worth it because it's going to 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.760
 be worth enough money if you ball 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.710
 helicopter five million imagine 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.540
 a mansion is worth but good where 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.730
 let's get as many money as there 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.910
 We will know because you already know that they have 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.040
 filtered new hidden files new 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.810
 hidden audios of new holdups so 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.390
 can still come many things 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.790
 gta 5 in the next image let's see 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.650
 also inside the building is worth inside 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.870
 of the garage as we have to take a 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.580
 curve inside the garage and in the 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.400
 next let's see how again 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.740
 we see the entrance door to the building and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.270
 the exit door of the building do 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.670
 what do I do , I hope you liked it 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.470
 the news you know there's nothing 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.100
 confirmed but possibly the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.680
 following 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.780
 or in the next dlc they may bring 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.850
 I can not confirm the mansions 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.080
 because there is nothing confirmed but here 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.240
 I leave the images in the description 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.730
 you have a greeting to all very many 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.720
 thank you for being there as always 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:41.330
 we will ask where the daughter thanks 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.330
 quite a greeting and goodbye
