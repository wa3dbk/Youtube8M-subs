 months april my name is dennis my 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.160
 name is tim and we present you 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.200
 Now again the top 5 online players 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.939
 of the month we have the april now 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.189
 almost done and now is our video 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.450
 Finished was finally finished and we 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.369
 have five pearls for you rausgesucht 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.829
 Present the world from place five to 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.899
 you can place one in the video here 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.300
 just click on it and you directly at 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.340
 We play on a festival exactly 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 have fun with the video and we see 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.410
 us back in the games 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.480
 so our first game in the top 5 and 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.190
 in the end a very nice game 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.940
 It was very relaxed to play 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.769
 now is not something for everyone but 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.910
 we have all sorts of games on 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.640
 a game that I think it does not have to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.960
 always shooter action rpg and 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.300
 That's why we also have this pearl 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.750
 taken is also is also very 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.300
 So popular has 150,000 facebook likes 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.090
 So as there are apparently many 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.289
 angler browsergamer out there for the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.270
 we also looked at it 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.070
 and I have to say pretty much 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.250
 made fun here you can see something 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.250
 here a body caught all over 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.810
 fischer we would have but I think 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.210
 even without the card I can of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.850
 Beijing, I now have the setting 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.580
 changed from one lake to the next 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.770
 Here we show you my crass ones 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.929
 other skills but pretty much it 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.899
 comes in the background so birdsong 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.630
 and that the sounds she makes just as 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.380
 and by the way you can even with this 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.179
 catch a few quests make fish throw 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.810
 added and now I'm curious 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.810
 which place four has to offer for us 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.600
 welcome to place four the league of 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.430
 king's no flash rpg under that I have 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.430
 you already times in the net flash presented 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.130
 but now here again in our top 5 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.430
 1 of my favorite games is mona looks 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.630
 pretty empty 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 but for a flash game really 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.880
 incredibly extensive what are you doing there 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.460
 through skills I see yes yes I have 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.210
 now even won the first league and 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.490
 one may use characteristic and to it 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.070
 you like these different resources 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.080
 here you get such crystals and he 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.660
 because its units can improve new ones 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 Unlock classes look right 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.840
 like in vienna clientgame and not like that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.070
 a little browserergame until you get here 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.000
 can play directly if you are under 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.550
 play my god oh my god yes so 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.410
 it even here with with quest too 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.150
 different factions not always so 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.040
 a little fight very wonderful yes 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.410
 now looks really great I know 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.910
 she alright so i would say that on 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.300
 every case a deserved place four 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.200
 yes, I'm curious what third place 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.200
 has to offer 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.860
 in third place we have 4 for you 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.680
 2 similar to world of tanks only on the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.920
 But that could well be a lake 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.690
 play out i heard worship is 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.430
 that's the conference with God 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.860
 who knows it now anyway in any case 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.190
 I like it all the time 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.890
 captain captain, of course, very much 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.390
 good and now also the shipyard in 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.120
 you are here a little bit ship 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.400
 can equip this is ok 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.150
 to a free-to-play clientgame exactly yes 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.580
 exactly 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.470
 So you do not learn a little one there 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.830
 you can also just jews on it 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.870
 that's 1 gigabyte or so and press 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.340
 then avoid the stock exchange since the election 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 quickly press play and already 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.959
 Let's get started really good 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.640
 And I think that has this place 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.500
 three earned here if you 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 equal to a battle you see there you are 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.830
 also why we show here one more 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.640
 few ships later on 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.520
 can buy 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 Towards the end, however, the finer ship 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.560
 beautiful means ok then I would say that 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.239
 it was with this game and now 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.239
 we'll meet again at second place 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.520
 so now we are at number 2 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.800
 arrived and that's hans josef vogel 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.449
 yes our own developed 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.639
 babbel shooter on which we all quite 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.220
 are proud here in the beautiful Alps 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.010
 setting with resi on the left and the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.740
 festspiele on the right side exactly 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.150
 who relishes her grass and feeds 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.220
 it is one 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.910
 classic babbel shooter here in the old 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.860
 design 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.360
 you just have to clear the bubbles 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.580
 and you get points for that and you can 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.540
 if you all turned away to the next 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.880
 level up 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.110
 yes and if you are very good then 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.000
 you can do it in ours too 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.160
 playing highscore list on the fed 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.030
 homepage has to be short before that 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.610
 to register 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.360
 then you can crack in the direct 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.460
 getting started 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.110
 and who comes this far or the other way around 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.970
 earlier you failed, resi also in 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.620
 speak for you on the lips 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.289
 so you should not miss it 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.350
 let as you see right here 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.400
 much schiller to the day 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.630
 You can also do well over the banks 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.250
 So I can play the game 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.449
 really just to heart and it has 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.539
 also earned the second place 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.770
 yes in any case so and now let 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.599
 we play all the games together again 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.860

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.260

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.480
 also not in front of the client title 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.890
 I have to say honestly 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.810
