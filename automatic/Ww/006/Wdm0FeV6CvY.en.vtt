except some sides of this wall and then

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.590 
except some sides of this wall and then
down<00:01:35.830> here's<00:01:36.310> alterna<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.450> get

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

down here's alterna and if you get
secure<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:41.320> we<00:01:41.410> think<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.070> first

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
secure but we think this is the first

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.550 
secure but we think this is the first
cuz<00:01:42.550> it's<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.940> feathered<00:01:43.270> on<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.540> xbox<00:01:43.930> /<00:01:44.170> 50

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
cuz it's a feathered on the xbox / 50

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.020 
cuz it's a feathered on the xbox / 50
micro<00:01:44.950> yeah<00:01:45.790> if<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.680> have<00:01:47.860> mushrooms<00:01:48.460> during

micro yeah if you have mushrooms during
this<00:01:49.300> thing<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.930> probably<00:01:50.260> getting<00:01:50.740> blown
