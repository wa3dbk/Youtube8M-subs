I'm going to explain to you a after
dryer<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.899> from<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.350> air<00:00:04.529> compressor<00:00:06.200> it's

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
dryer on a from my air compressor it's

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.650 
dryer on a from my air compressor it's
50<00:00:08.250> degrees<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.790> Central<00:00:08.970> Texas<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.599> morning

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
50 degrees in Central Texas this morning

50 degrees in Central Texas this morning
in<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.590> air<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> kind<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.250> cool<00:00:13.340> normally

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
in you the air is kind of cool normally

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.150 
in you the air is kind of cool normally
when<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.719> run<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> compressor<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.890> run<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
when you run a compressor and I run a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.250 
when you run a compressor and I run a
compressor<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> plasma<00:00:18.630> table

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
compressor a lot I have a plasma table

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.740 
compressor a lot I have a plasma table
you<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> paint<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you know a paint with it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.279 
you know a paint with it
I<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.830> sandblaster<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> runs<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I have a sandblaster so it runs for a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.880 
I have a sandblaster so it runs for a
good<00:00:25.680> while<00:00:26.599> on<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> normal<00:00:27.990> compressor<00:00:28.650> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
good while on a normal compressor this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
good while on a normal compressor this
copper<00:00:29.880> fitting<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> go<00:00:30.660> straight

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
copper fitting is going to go straight

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.400 
copper fitting is going to go straight
down<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> tank<00:00:32.780> if<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.200> been

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
down to the tank if this has been

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
down to the tank if this has been
running<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> while<00:00:35.329> that<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.719> over

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
running a while that will get up over

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.979 
running a while that will get up over
300<00:00:37.260> degrees<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> you're<00:00:39.420> putting<00:00:39.629> three

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
300 degrees so you're putting three

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
300 degrees so you're putting three
hundred<00:00:40.230> degrees<00:00:41.210> air<00:00:42.500> into<00:00:43.500> 50<00:00:43.860> gallon<00:00:44.280> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
hundred degrees air into 50 gallon or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.229 
hundred degrees air into 50 gallon or
into<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> 50<00:00:45.510> degree<00:00:45.870> air<00:00:46.110> tank<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:47.120> used<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
into a 50 degree air tank I used to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
into a 50 degree air tank I used to
always<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> moisture<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.920> coming

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
always think that the moisture is coming

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.869 
always think that the moisture is coming
into<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.610> compressor<00:00:51.829> was<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> air

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
into your compressor was from the air

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
into your compressor was from the air
itself<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.600> moisture<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> there<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
itself the moisture that's in there and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.250 
itself the moisture that's in there and
that<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.129> part<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> found

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that that's part of it what I found

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.400 
that that's part of it what I found
through<00:00:58.710> doing<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.210> testing<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.329> stuff<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
through doing some testing and stuff the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920 
through doing some testing and stuff the
majority<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> air<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> majority<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
majority of the air or the majority of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
majority of the air or the majority of
the<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.619> gets<00:01:04.739> into<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.070> tank<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the water that gets into your tank is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
the water that gets into your tank is
because<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> hot<00:01:07.110> air<00:01:07.909> when<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> cools<00:01:09.240> down

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
because the hot air when it cools down

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
because the hot air when it cools down
and<00:01:09.630> compensates<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> sweats<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.540> produces

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and compensates and sweats and produces

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
and compensates and sweats and produces
a<00:01:12.570> lot<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> moisture<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> did<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.790> took<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
a lot of moisture so what I did I took a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
a lot of moisture so what I did I took a
copper<00:01:18.450> tubing<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.740> made<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.310> about

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
copper tubing and I made this for about

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.370 
copper tubing and I made this for about
$50<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.950> adapted<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> copper<00:01:23.400> tubing<00:01:24.259> kind<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
$50 I adapted a copper tubing kind of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
$50 I adapted a copper tubing kind of
ran<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> swirl<00:01:26.280> pattern<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ran it into a swirl pattern and then I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.569 
ran it into a swirl pattern and then I
actually<00:01:28.170> run<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.070> water<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.490> I'm

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
actually run it into some water that I'm

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually run it into some water that I'm
going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> show<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:31.280> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to show you in a little bit but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to show you in a little bit but
this<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:33.650> reduce<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.860> amount<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> water

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this will reduce your amount of water

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.890 
this will reduce your amount of water
tremendously<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> set<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
tremendously so with that set in the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020 
tremendously so with that set in the
other<00:01:40.020> part<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> video<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.340> air<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
other part of the video that the air is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.190 
other part of the video that the air is
running<00:01:42.270> through<00:01:42.390> there's<00:01:42.570> copper<00:01:42.840> tubing

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
running through there's copper tubing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
running through there's copper tubing
cooling<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.610> through<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
cooling off a little bit through the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.440 
cooling off a little bit through the
just<00:01:45.990> through<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> air<00:01:46.790> but<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> did

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
just through the air but then what I did

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.740 
just through the air but then what I did
I<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.200> coil<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.100> copper<00:01:50.159> tubing<00:01:50.750> running

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I have a coil of copper tubing running

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.100 
I have a coil of copper tubing running
into<00:01:52.020> 50<00:01:52.350> gallons<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.860> water<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> water<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
into 50 gallons of water so the water is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.459 
into 50 gallons of water so the water is
50<00:01:55.560> degrees<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:57.390> cools<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.200> air

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
50 degrees right now it cools that air

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.679 
50 degrees right now it cools that air
off<00:01:58.740> by<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> time<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.180> gets<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
off by the time it gets here it's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
off by the time it gets here it's
already<00:02:00.960> lowered<00:02:01.290> quite<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
already lowered quite a bit but when you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.530 
already lowered quite a bit but when you
run<00:02:03.119> into<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> water<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.170> back<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:05.540> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
run into the water and then back out it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.070 
run into the water and then back out it
cools<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.399> almost<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:09.060> 50<00:02:09.450> degrees<00:02:09.750> again

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
cools it off almost to 50 degrees again

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.300 
cools it off almost to 50 degrees again
so<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> air<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.540> your<00:02:12.690> tank

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
so so the air going in your tank

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.260 
so so the air going in your tank
is<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.080> same<00:02:15.260> temperatures<00:02:15.800> outside<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
is it the same temperatures outside and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.850 
is it the same temperatures outside and
it<00:02:17.690> doesn't<00:02:18.050> sweat<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:20.930> more<00:02:21.200> -<00:02:21.349> one

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
it doesn't sweat and just one more - one

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.339 
it doesn't sweat and just one more - one

will<00:02:31.849> run<00:02:32.090> up<00:02:32.269> we'll<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.099> pinhole

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
will run up we'll make a little pinhole

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.199 
will run up we'll make a little pinhole
in<00:02:36.230> your<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:37.069> your<00:02:37.130> tubing<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.819> start<00:02:38.060> leaking

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
in your in your tubing and start leaking

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.020 
in your in your tubing and start leaking
air<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.340> actually<00:02:40.519> had<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> little

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
air and then I actually had a little

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.870 
air and then I actually had a little
radiator<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.099> before<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.220> goes<00:02:43.400> back<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
radiator and before it goes back in the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000 
radiator and before it goes back in the
tank<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.239> run<00:02:44.420> into<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> little<00:02:44.900> radiator<00:02:45.350> that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
tank I run into a little radiator that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.800 
tank I run into a little radiator that
runs<00:02:46.310> through<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.670> fan<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.269> that's<00:02:47.630> what

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
runs through the fan and that's what

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.630 
runs through the fan and that's what
most<00:02:48.080> after<00:02:48.500> coolers<00:02:48.799> are<00:02:49.010> they're<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.489> this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
most after coolers are they're just this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.300 
most after coolers are they're just this
little<00:02:49.819> radiator<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:51.260> there<00:02:51.650> forcing<00:02:51.920> air

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
little radiator in there forcing air

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.559 
little radiator in there forcing air
through<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.730> cool<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.000> off<00:02:53.090> just<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
through it to cool it off just like the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.449 
through it to cool it off just like the
radiator<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.080> car<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:56.260> yellow<00:02:57.260> dryer<00:02:57.650> is

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
radiator of a car that yellow dryer is

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.150 
radiator of a car that yellow dryer is
what<00:02:58.700> everybody<00:02:59.120> have<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.049> their<00:03:00.260> compressor

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
what everybody have on their compressor

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.720 
what everybody have on their compressor
line<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:03.230> before<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> put<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.130> after<00:03:04.430> dryer

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
line but before I put in the after dryer

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.960 
line but before I put in the after dryer
I<00:03:05.030> would<00:03:05.840> actually<00:03:06.019> go<00:03:06.380> change<00:03:06.799> or<00:03:07.580> turn<00:03:07.819> that

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
I would actually go change or turn that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.690 
I would actually go change or turn that
cockpit<00:03:08.420> open<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.989> get<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> half<00:03:10.549> an

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
cockpit open and get like a half an

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.070 
cockpit open and get like a half an
ounce<00:03:10.849> or<00:03:11.000> an<00:03:11.090> ounce<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.390> water<00:03:11.630> out<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.870> it

ounce or an ounce of water out of it
every<00:03:12.410> day<00:03:12.560> before<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.010> would<00:03:13.099> start<00:03:13.430> since

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
every day before I would start since

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.780 
every day before I would start since
I've<00:03:14.569> had<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> after<00:03:15.170> dryer<00:03:15.380> on<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.890> get<00:03:16.549> no

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
I've had the after dryer on I get no

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.360 
I've had the after dryer on I get no
moisture<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.600> tank<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.890> dryer

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
moisture in that tank or in that dryer

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.849 
moisture in that tank or in that dryer
and<00:03:19.720> if<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.840> kind<00:03:21.109> of<00:03:21.230> look<00:03:21.410> as<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:22.549> pan<00:03:23.060> here

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
and if you kind of look as I pan here

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.849 
and if you kind of look as I pan here
the<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.880> actually<00:03:26.209> has<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.359> drip<00:03:26.660> loop<00:03:26.900> with<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
the it actually has a drip loop with the

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.559 
the it actually has a drip loop with the
PVC<00:03:28.370> pipe<00:03:29.200> before<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.470> goes<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:30.829> shop<00:03:31.130> as

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
PVC pipe before it goes in the shop as

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.849 
PVC pipe before it goes in the shop as
it's<00:03:32.569> coming<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.260> compressor<00:03:33.530> it

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
it's coming out of the compressor it

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.370 
it's coming out of the compressor it
actually<00:03:34.190> slants<00:03:34.640> down<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.690> all<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.959> moisture

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
actually slants down so all the moisture

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.880 
actually slants down so all the moisture
should<00:03:36.650> after<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.519> comes<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> tank

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
should after it comes out of the tank

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.009 
should after it comes out of the tank
should<00:03:39.890> run<00:03:40.280> downhill<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.299> all<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.840> go
