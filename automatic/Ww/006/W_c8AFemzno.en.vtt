00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
got it's like it's like movie with such
a<00:01:19.590> great<00:01:19.860> without<00:01:20.159> lubricant<00:01:22.549> we<00:01:23.549> chose<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
a great without lubricant we chose to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
a great without lubricant we chose to
get<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> fat<00:01:24.570> reversion<00:01:25.380> reason<00:01:25.799> being<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
get the fat reversion reason being it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
get the fat reversion reason being it
has<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> least<00:01:27.509> amount<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> moisture

has the least amount of moisture

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
has the least amount of moisture
therefore<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> becomes<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.820> much<00:01:30.090> more

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
therefore it becomes much much more

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.030 
therefore it becomes much much more
