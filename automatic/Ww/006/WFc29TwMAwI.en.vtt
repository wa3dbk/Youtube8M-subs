00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.289 

okay<00:00:00.840> starting<00:00:01.530> with<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.770> femur<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.580> have<00:00:05.299> to

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
okay starting with the femur we have to

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.210 
okay starting with the femur we have to
figure<00:00:06.690> out<00:00:06.720> which<00:00:06.960> side<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.919> lake<00:00:08.069> it's

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
figure out which side of the lake it's

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.919 
figure out which side of the lake it's
going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.700> when<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.179> find<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.719> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
going to be on when you find that this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.520 
going to be on when you find that this
is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.170> anterior<00:00:10.559> side<00:00:11.240> its<00:00:12.240> know<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
is the anterior side its know that the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.080 
is the anterior side its know that the
head<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:15.680> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> insert<00:00:17.220> into<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.760> honest

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
head is going to insert into the honest

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.429 
head is going to insert into the honest
 end<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> acetabulum<00:00:19.380> and

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
 end of the acetabulum and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.490 
 end of the acetabulum and
basically<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> flip<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
basically if this is going to flip it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
basically if this is going to flip it
over<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> posterior<00:00:26.279> side<00:00:27.890> that<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.880> head<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
over the posterior side that the head of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.550 
over the posterior side that the head of
this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:30.929> into<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> asset

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this is going to go right into the asset

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.069 
this is going to go right into the asset
tags<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> messaging<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.730> body<00:00:33.079> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
tags on the messaging of your body so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.580 
tags on the messaging of your body so
you<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> right

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 

because<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.220> is<00:00:38.370> anterior<00:00:38.880> side<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
because this is anterior side and this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
because this is anterior side and this
is<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:40.110> needs<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.710> body

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
is what needs to go on your body

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.900 
is what needs to go on your body
okay<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:42.720> these<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.620> analyzing<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.400> party

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
okay so these are analyzing at a party

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
okay so these are analyzing at a party
out<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.060> I<00:00:45.510> start<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:47.270> we<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.440> head<00:00:49.620> up

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
out here I start off we have the head up

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.480 
out here I start off we have the head up
here<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> neck

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
here the neck

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.790 
here the neck
I<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.150> greater<00:00:54.420> trochanter<00:00:54.780> which<00:00:55.650> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I have the greater trochanter which is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
I have the greater trochanter which is
this<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.100> spot<00:00:56.700> up<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.720> lesser

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this little spot up here the lesser

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.030 
this little spot up here the lesser
trochanter<00:00:58.380> down<00:00:58.950> here<00:00:59.900> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
trochanter down here the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.610 
trochanter down here the
intertrochanteric<00:01:02.040> crest<00:01:03.470> which<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
intertrochanteric crest which is

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.140 
intertrochanteric crest which is
basically<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.190> crest<00:01:05.490> that<00:01:05.640> goes<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.000> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basically this crest that goes from here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
basically this crest that goes from here
to<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.140> flip<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> over<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
to here as we flip it over on the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.540 
to here as we flip it over on the
anterior<00:01:08.820> side<00:01:09.980> starting<00:01:10.980> in<00:01:11.070> towards<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
anterior side starting in towards the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.000 
anterior side starting in towards the
top<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.870> greater<00:01:13.080> trochanter<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
top with the greater trochanter this is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.790 
top with the greater trochanter this is
actually<00:01:14.370> in<00:01:14.580> control<00:01:14.760> Cantera<00:01:15.360> Cline<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
actually in control Cantera Cline on the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.000 
actually in control Cantera Cline on the
anterior<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:19.230> then<00:01:19.350> flipping<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> back

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
anterior side and then flipping it back

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.910 
anterior side and then flipping it back
over<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.370> posterior<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.260> middle<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
over the posterior in the middle of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
over the posterior in the middle of the
intertrochanteric<00:01:23.370> crest

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
intertrochanteric crest

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
intertrochanteric crest
we<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> quadrate<00:01:25.770> tubercle<00:01:26.369> which<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
we have the quadrate tubercle which is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
we have the quadrate tubercle which is
this<00:01:27.000> area<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.520> flip<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.320> up<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
this area and then as we flip it up a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.330 
this area and then as we flip it up a
little<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.510> we<00:01:33.510> have<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.680> trochanteric

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
little bit here we have the trochanteric

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit here we have the trochanteric
fossa<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:37.410> just<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.950> meso<00:01:38.220> area<00:01:38.760> right

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
fossa which is just a meso area right

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
fossa which is just a meso area right
here<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.610> groove<00:01:41.610> or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
here it's that little groove or

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.750 
here it's that little groove or
phosphate<00:01:42.270> deep<00:01:42.479> down<00:01:42.690> there

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
phosphate deep down there

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.240 
phosphate deep down there
man<00:01:44.300> at<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.530> top<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.890> head<00:01:46.100> with

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
man at the on the top of the head with

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.970 
man at the on the top of the head with
the<00:01:46.400> fovea<00:01:46.790> capitis<00:01:47.030> which<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.620> little

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
the fovea capitis which is this little

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.800 
the fovea capitis which is this little
impression<00:01:50.800> one<00:01:51.800> my<00:01:51.950> finger<00:01:52.280> has<00:01:52.430> point

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.679 

moving<00:01:57.170> down

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:08.080 

we<00:02:00.020> have<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.560> spiral<00:02:01.070> line<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:03.619> comes<00:02:03.950> from

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.520 

basically<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.960> below

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.480 

the<00:02:12.540> lesser<00:02:13.540> trochanter<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:15.070> works<00:02:15.310> its

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
the lesser trochanter and it works its

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.750 
the lesser trochanter and it works its
way<00:02:15.640> across<00:02:15.990> towards<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.050> Linea<00:02:17.350> aspera<00:02:17.760> it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
way across towards the Linea aspera it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.309 
way across towards the Linea aspera it
starts<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.120> here<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.360> then<00:02:19.450> moves<00:02:19.660> down

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.259 

at<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:22.980> tech<00:02:23.189> teneal<00:02:23.549> line<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.939> just<00:02:24.030> comes

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
at the tech teneal line that just comes

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.839 
at the tech teneal line that just comes
directly<00:02:24.719> down<00:02:25.519> from<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.670> lesser<00:02:26.939> trochanter

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
directly down from the lesser trochanter

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.770 
directly down from the lesser trochanter
and<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.510> Linea<00:02:29.810> aspera<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.280> further<00:02:31.780> just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
and a Linea aspera that is further just

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.080 
and a Linea aspera that is further just
down<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.079> shaft<00:02:33.349> basically<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.219> gluteal

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
down the shaft basically here gluteal

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.170 
down the shaft basically here gluteal
tuberosity<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:36.019> more<00:02:36.829> up<00:02:37.010> top<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.609> this<00:02:37.730> area

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
tuberosity is more up top and this area

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.550 
tuberosity is more up top and this area
it's<00:02:38.719> a<00:02:38.750> little<00:02:38.930> bit<00:02:39.049> wider

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.610 

and<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.490> obviously<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.600> shaft<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.530> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and this is obviously the shaft of the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.580 
and this is obviously the shaft of the
femur<00:02:45.240> we<00:02:46.240> have<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.450> adductor<00:02:46.900> tubercle<00:02:46.930> down

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
femur we have the adductor tubercle down

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.710 
femur we have the adductor tubercle down
towards<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> bottom<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:49.060> since<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.569> a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
towards the bottom so since it's a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.790 
towards the bottom so since it's a
duction<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:51.520> going<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.410> medial

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
duction it's going to be on the medial

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.360 
duction it's going to be on the medial
side<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> adductor<00:02:55.420> tubercle<00:02:55.450> is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
side so the adductor tubercle is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.979 
side so the adductor tubercle is
actually<00:02:57.370> right<00:02:57.640> here<00:02:57.670> along<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.569> medial

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
actually right here along the medial

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.350 
actually right here along the medial
supracondylar<00:02:59.560> Ridge<00:03:00.160> that's<00:03:00.640> kind<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.239> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
supracondylar Ridge that's kind of this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.510 
supracondylar Ridge that's kind of this
little<00:03:01.630> bone<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.360> right<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.230> area

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.240 

so<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.240> have<00:03:09.360> menial<00:03:09.810> supracondylar<00:03:10.350> original

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
so we have menial supracondylar original

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.510 
so we have menial supracondylar original
lateral<00:03:11.640> supracondylar<00:03:11.910> Ridge<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.400> have

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
lateral supracondylar Ridge and we have

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.380 
lateral supracondylar Ridge and we have
the<00:03:14.760> medial<00:03:15.630> condyle<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.940> lateral<00:03:17.940> condyle

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
the medial condyle and lateral condyle

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.680 
the medial condyle and lateral condyle
and<00:03:18.570> intercondylar<00:03:19.560> fossa<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:21.120> down<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
and intercondylar fossa is down in this

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.710 
and intercondylar fossa is down in this
area<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.760> then<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> outsides<00:03:24.540> we

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
area and then on the outsides we

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.050 
area and then on the outsides we
actually<00:03:25.020> have<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.290> medial<00:03:26.040> epicondyle<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
actually have the medial epicondyle and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.100 
actually have the medial epicondyle and
then<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.720> lateral<00:03:28.260> epicondyle<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.210> side

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.230 

on<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.490> what<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.850> call<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
on the back here is what we call the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.370 
on the back here is what we call the
popliteal<00:03:37.810> surface<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.030> on<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.360> front<00:03:40.660> this

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
popliteal surface and on the front this

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.290 
popliteal surface and on the front this
is<00:03:41.440> going<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.340> be<00:03:42.430> considered<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.970> patellar

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
is going to be considered the patellar

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.220 
is going to be considered the patellar
surface<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.530> patellar<00:03:45.160> surface

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.190 

and<00:03:48.800> then<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.220> two<00:03:49.400> more<00:03:49.610> things<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:50.200> are

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
and then just two more things that are

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
and then just two more things that are
on<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.730> lateral<00:03:53.209> side<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:57.620> femur<00:03:58.010> we<00:03:58.819> have

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
on the lateral side the femur we have

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.690 
on the lateral side the femur we have
these<00:03:59.090> two<00:03:59.360> groups<00:03:59.690> basically<00:04:00.370> actually<00:04:01.370> one

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
these two groups basically actually one

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.809 
these two groups basically actually one
is<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.879> groove<00:04:02.239> and<00:04:02.360> one<00:04:02.569> is<00:04:02.690> an<00:04:02.780> impression<00:04:03.319> so

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.410 

so<00:04:10.330> this<00:04:10.750> little<00:04:11.049> spot<00:04:11.319> right<00:04:11.349> here<00:04:11.799> is<00:04:12.420> the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
so this little spot right here is the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360 
so this little spot right here is the
impression<00:04:13.840> for<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.260> lateral<00:04:14.799> head<00:04:15.069> of<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
impression for the lateral head of the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.789 
impression for the lateral head of the
gastroc<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.000> then<00:04:16.329> just<00:04:16.570> below<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> that

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
gastroc and then just below that that

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.040 
gastroc and then just below that that
runs<00:04:18.479> down<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:20.729> just<00:04:21.729> underneath<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
runs down and just underneath it is the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.310 
runs down and just underneath it is the
groove<00:04:23.320> for<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.620> popliteus<00:04:24.190> tendon<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:25.510> that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
groove for the popliteus tendon so that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.889 
groove for the popliteus tendon so that
should<00:04:26.590> be<00:04:26.770> it
