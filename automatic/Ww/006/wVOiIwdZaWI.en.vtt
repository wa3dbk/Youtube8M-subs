00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
this stuff up just make it look
basically<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.900> is<00:00:34.019> because<00:00:34.410> we're<00:00:35.070> not

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
basically what it is because we're not

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.710 
basically what it is because we're not
really<00:00:35.309> sure<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.699> looks<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.000> overall

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
really sure what it looks like overall

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.110

me<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.370> such<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> small

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
me in the game because such a small

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.139 
me in the game because such a small
graphic<00:00:40.460> everything<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> same<00:00:41.610> nothing

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
graphic everything is the same nothing

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.580 
graphic everything is the same nothing
has<00:00:42.270> changed<00:00:42.570> except<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> paint<00:00:43.290> really

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
has changed except just the paint really

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
has changed except just the paint really
um<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.370> noticed<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.880> paint<00:00:45.090> adds<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.600> couple

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
um I noticed the paint adds a couple

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.780 
um I noticed the paint adds a couple
thousands<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> young<00:00:46.860> bull<00:00:47.280> mechanism

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
thousands on to the young bull mechanism

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.360 
thousands on to the young bull mechanism
obviously<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> has<00:00:49.590> stitched<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.129> little

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
obviously so it has stitched up a little

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.850 
obviously so it has stitched up a little
bit<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.940> hopefully<00:00:51.750> by<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> time<00:00:52.290> comic-con

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
bit but hopefully by the time comic-con

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
bit but hopefully by the time comic-con
runs<00:00:53.190> around<00:00:53.690> sometime<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> summer<00:00:55.469> I'll

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
runs around sometime in the summer I'll

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
runs around sometime in the summer I'll
had<00:00:56.190> everything<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> kinks<00:00:57.120> worked<00:00:57.239> out

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
had everything all the kinks worked out

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
had everything all the kinks worked out
and<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.870> completely<00:00:58.170> smooth<00:00:58.500> operating

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and have it completely smooth operating

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.090 
and have it completely smooth operating
but<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> hook<00:01:01.079> em<00:01:01.350> boy<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> makes

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just looks so pretty like this is going

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.770 
just looks so pretty like this is going
to<00:01:45.599> be<00:01:45.660> mounted<00:01:45.780> onto<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.410> hidden<00:01:46.649> blade

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
to be mounted onto the hidden blade

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.449 
to be mounted onto the hidden blade
after<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.289> bracer<00:01:49.679> on<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> front

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
after you know the bracer on that front

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:57.020 
after you know the bracer on that front
on<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:54.330> tin<00:01:54.869> boy<00:01:55.080> up<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> different<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.190> guess
