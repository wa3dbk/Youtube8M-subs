hello and welcome to my tutorial where

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.610 
hello and welcome to my tutorial where
I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.250> show<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.960> to<00:00:06.960> model

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
I'm going to show you how to model

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.310 
I'm going to show you how to model
architectural<00:00:08.400> since<00:00:09.469> the<00:00:10.469> right<00:00:11.160> way<00:00:11.460> are

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
architectural since the right way are

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.400 
architectural since the right way are
like<00:00:13.320> i<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.860> call<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:15.109> fastest<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
like i like to call it the fastest and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
like i like to call it the fastest and
the<00:00:16.440> most<00:00:16.760> correct<00:00:17.760> way<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:19.850> let's<00:00:20.850> do

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the most correct way to do it let's do

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.689 
the most correct way to do it let's do
it<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.960> traditional<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:23.720> first<00:00:25.189> most<00:00:26.189> people

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it the traditional way first most people

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.840 
it the traditional way first most people
do<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> cube<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.480> then<00:00:30.480> hold<00:00:31.170> d<00:00:32.160> in

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
do this here the cube and then hold d in

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.330 
do this here the cube and then hold d in
the<00:00:32.910> keyboard<00:00:33.620> deeper<00:00:34.620> dog<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:36.290> then

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
the keyboard deeper dog and then

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260 
the keyboard deeper dog and then
activate<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> apexes<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:40.040> holding<00:00:41.040> G<00:00:41.340> also

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
activate the apexes then holding G also

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.740 
activate the apexes then holding G also
hold<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.860> snap<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:48.390> middle

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
hold see now you can snap it now middle

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.720 
hold see now you can snap it now middle
mouse<00:00:48.930> button<00:00:48.960> drag<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.059> bottom<00:00:51.449> edge

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
mouse button drag in the bottom edge

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
mouse button drag in the bottom edge
it'll<00:00:53.730> snap<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.930> direction<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it'll snap in only one direction the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.500 
it'll snap in only one direction the
snapping<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.320> Maya<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.640> effective<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
snapping in Maya is very effective and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
snapping in Maya is very effective and
very<00:01:00.600> flexible<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> whole<00:01:04.350> tutorial

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
very flexible I can do a whole tutorial

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.090 
very flexible I can do a whole tutorial
on<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.430> napping<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.900> let's<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.530> skip<00:01:08.040> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on just napping so let's just skip it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
on just napping so let's just skip it
for<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.430> people<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for now people do this they make it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.450 
for now people do this they make it
walks<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.790> snap<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> tea<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.780> point<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.500> gay

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
walks the snap of tea but point this gay

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:25.690 
walks the snap of tea but point this gay
lift<00:01:16.189> yeah<00:01:17.509> that's<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.259> make<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> walls

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.730 

now<00:01:27.619> they<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.859> duplicate<00:01:30.469> one<00:01:31.469> walk<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:33.740> then

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
now they can duplicate one walk and then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.359 
now they can duplicate one walk and then
just<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.670> shift<00:01:39.030> D<00:01:39.299> cup<00:01:39.539> of<00:01:39.689> times<00:01:40.369> complete

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
just it shift D cup of times complete

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:51.410 
just it shift D cup of times complete
the<00:01:41.579> floor<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> add<00:01:42.840> another<00:01:43.200> box

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.640 

for<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> rule<00:01:54.200> add<00:01:55.200> boxes

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.950 

for<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> doors<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:07.610> for<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> windows<00:02:09.119> select

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
for the doors and for the windows select

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.550 
for the doors and for the windows select
the<00:02:10.050> big<00:02:10.290> wall<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.850> door<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.990> there<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the big wall then the door up there and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:24.110 
the big wall then the door up there and
then<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:19.010> mesh<00:02:20.240> boolean<00:02:21.240> difference<00:02:22.250> are<00:02:23.250> I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
then go to mesh boolean difference are I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.280 
then go to mesh boolean difference are I
have<00:02:24.960> added<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.950> book<00:02:26.130> into<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.550> shelf<00:02:26.850> by

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
have added that book into my shelf by

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.900 
have added that book into my shelf by
clicking<00:02:28.520> mash<00:02:29.630> boolean<00:02:31.070> difference<00:02:32.070> holding

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
clicking mash boolean difference holding

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.900 
clicking mash boolean difference holding
ctrl<00:02:33.300> shift<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:35.040> way<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.490> add<00:02:35.730> it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
ctrl shift and that way you can add it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.080 
ctrl shift and that way you can add it
to<00:02:35.940> your<00:02:36.150> shelf<00:02:36.890> let<00:02:37.890> me<00:02:38.010> delete<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.790> now

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.490 

okay<00:02:42.090> let's<00:02:42.450> go<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.780> our<00:02:42.810> viewport<00:02:44.270> again

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
okay let's go to our viewport again

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.270 
okay let's go to our viewport again
select<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> big<00:02:46.770> one<00:02:46.980> still<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> small<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
select a big one still the small one and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.730 
select a big one still the small one and
then<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:52.910> boolean<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.900> way<00:02:55.170> people

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.220 

models<00:02:58.740> architecture<00:03:00.470> interiors<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.810> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
models architecture interiors but that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.100 
models architecture interiors but that
is<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> very<00:03:04.860> good<00:03:05.100> way<00:03:05.490> why<00:03:06.120> let<00:03:06.810> me<00:03:06.959> show

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
is not a very good way why let me show

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.509 
is not a very good way why let me show
you<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.050> see<00:03:10.459> closely<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.950> models<00:03:14.370> are

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
you if you see closely the models are

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.500 
you if you see closely the models are
separated<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.610> want<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.700> go<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
separated so if you want to go to the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.040 
separated so if you want to go to the
rendering<00:03:21.930> part<00:03:22.230> waiting<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.459> add<00:03:24.050> finely

other<00:03:25.470> or<00:03:25.709> degrading<00:03:26.310> render<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:28.140> know

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
other or degrading render and you know

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.210 
other or degrading render and you know
use<00:03:28.640> final<00:03:29.640> gather<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.320> mental<00:03:31.320> ray<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:31.739> a

use final gather for mental ray or a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.500 
use final gather for mental ray or a
readiness<00:03:32.580> vertical<00:03:33.150> from<00:03:33.330> vray<00:03:35.510> these

readiness vertical from vray these

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.320 
readiness vertical from vray these
corners<00:03:37.110> most<00:03:37.830> people<00:03:38.130> mental<00:03:38.640> ray<00:03:38.790> these

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
corners most people mental ray these

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.020 
corners most people mental ray these
corners<00:03:39.750> with<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.730> inventory<00:03:41.730> if<00:03:41.880> I

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
corners with that inventory if I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.539 
corners with that inventory if I
rendered<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.840> final<00:03:43.170> gather<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.650> photons

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
rendered is it final gather and photons

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.690 
rendered is it final gather and photons
then<00:03:45.480> these<00:03:46.110> corners<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:46.950> going<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.549> gather

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
then these corners are going to gather

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.000 
then these corners are going to gather
too<00:03:48.000> much<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.390> homes<00:03:48.660> on<00:03:48.930> look<00:03:49.200> like<00:03:49.440> that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
too much for homes on look like that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.180 
too much for homes on look like that
these<00:03:50.459> places<00:03:50.850> are<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.890> there's<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.950> light

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
these places are this there's a light

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.210 
these places are this there's a light
bulb<00:03:53.610> here<00:03:53.880> someone<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.260> these<00:03:55.440> places<00:03:55.920> will

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
bulb here someone so these places will

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.050 
bulb here someone so these places will
like<00:03:56.580> burn<00:03:58.160> really<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.310> displace<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.730> should

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
like burn really to displace it should

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.120 
like burn really to displace it should
look<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.510> bit<00:04:00.750> Dirk<00:04:01.019> because<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.190> corner<00:04:02.580> right

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.760 

so<00:04:06.620> these<00:04:07.620> are<00:04:07.760> separate<00:04:08.760> models<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.410> that's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
so these are separate models so that's

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.790 
so these are separate models so that's
why<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.360> problems<00:04:12.930> while<00:04:14.240> using<00:04:15.240> GI

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
why you have problems while using GI

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.940 
why you have problems while using GI
rendering<00:04:17.959> global<00:04:18.959> illumination<00:04:19.140> problems

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
rendering global illumination problems

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.440 
rendering global illumination problems
here<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:23.040> way<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.250> do<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> correct<00:04:24.300> way

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
here so the way to do it the correct way

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.500 
here so the way to do it the correct way
to<00:04:24.570> model<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.610> modeling<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.790> seamlessly

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
to model it is modeling it seamlessly

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:37.780 
to model it is modeling it seamlessly
you<00:04:28.380> know<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.430> was<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:34.430> like<00:04:35.430> this<00:04:35.670> like

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
you know if it was like like this like

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.640 
you know if it was like like this like
this<00:04:38.790> if<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.330> go<00:04:39.480> inside<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.500> box<00:04:41.570> now<00:04:42.650> this

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
this if you go inside the box now this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.980 
this if you go inside the box now this
corner<00:04:44.070> will<00:04:44.250> render<00:04:44.580> much<00:04:44.790> faster<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.420> much

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
corner will render much faster and much

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.940 
corner will render much faster and much
better<00:04:46.590> because<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.640> seamless<00:04:48.090> model

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
better because this is a seamless model

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.990 
better because this is a seamless model
see<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:51.450> is<00:04:51.630> one<00:04:52.380> vertex<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.010> all<00:04:53.280> three<00:04:53.580> ages

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
see it is one vertex and all three ages

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.060 
see it is one vertex and all three ages
move<00:04:54.330> with<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.540> this<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.560> what<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.740> call

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
move with it this is what I call

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.090 
move with it this is what I call
seamless<00:04:56.550> model<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.770> how<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.830> achieve<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.520> and

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
seamless model and how to achieve it and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.810 
seamless model and how to achieve it and
interior<00:05:02.100> more<00:05:02.370> below<00:05:02.580> as<00:05:03.050> like<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.820> again

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
interior more below as like this again

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.020 
interior more below as like this again
here<00:05:06.000> like<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.310> make<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> plan<00:05:09.590> scale<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:11.030> you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
here like this make a plan scale it you

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.600 
here like this make a plan scale it you
can<00:05:12.150> even<00:05:12.270> have<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.900> image<00:05:13.530> plane<00:05:13.830> under<00:05:14.280> nick

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
can even have a image plane under nick

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.740 
can even have a image plane under nick
and<00:05:14.910> add<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.750> transparent<00:05:16.500> shaded<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
and add a transparent shaded to the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.190 
and add a transparent shaded to the
mortal<00:05:18.750> plane<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:21.030> can<00:05:21.210> see<00:05:21.600> through<00:05:21.900> it

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
mortal plane so you can see through it

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.490 
mortal plane so you can see through it
to<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.340> image<00:05:23.550> plane<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:24.000> then<00:05:24.840> just<00:05:25.140> you

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
to the image plane and then just you

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.909 
to the image plane and then just you
know<00:05:25.620> do<00:05:26.550> what<00:05:26.790> i'm<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.180> do<00:05:27.360> now

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.900 

subdivisions<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.070> one<00:05:34.340> by<00:05:34.550> one<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.990> now<00:05:36.910> I'm

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
subdivisions of one by one so now I'm

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.650 
subdivisions of one by one so now I'm
going<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.840> add<00:05:39.820> subdivisions<00:05:40.820> to<00:05:41.000> it<00:05:43.480> maybe<00:05:44.480> I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
going to add subdivisions to it maybe I

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.620 
going to add subdivisions to it maybe I
need<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.990> room<00:05:45.260> here<00:05:48.370> add<00:05:49.370> thickness<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.510> your

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
need a room here add thickness to your

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.129 
need a room here add thickness to your
model<00:05:50.950> these<00:05:51.950> are<00:05:52.190> walls<00:05:53.169> lines<00:05:54.169> and<00:05:54.410> putting

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
model these are walls lines and putting

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.190 
model these are walls lines and putting
these<00:05:57.139> are<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.440> thicknesses<00:05:57.889> of<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.160> walk

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
these are the thicknesses of a walk

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.400 
these are the thicknesses of a walk
maybe<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.560> need<00:06:00.680> a<00:06:00.980> room<00:06:01.310> here<00:06:02.440> okay<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:05.410> maybe

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
maybe I need a room here okay and maybe

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.230 
maybe I need a room here okay and maybe
I<00:06:07.360> need<00:06:08.360> a<00:06:08.419> long<00:06:08.750> corridor<00:06:09.200> here<00:06:09.790> your<00:06:10.790> be<00:06:11.000> told

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
I need a long corridor here your be told

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.659 
I need a long corridor here your be told
here<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.690> maybe<00:06:12.260> he'll<00:06:12.650> need<00:06:12.860> alone<00:06:13.190> two

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
here and maybe he'll need alone two

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.360 
here and maybe he'll need alone two
rooms<00:06:13.970> here<00:06:15.070> okay<00:06:16.750> maybe<00:06:17.750> small<00:06:18.620> bathroom

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
rooms here okay maybe small bathroom

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.560 
rooms here okay maybe small bathroom
here<00:06:23.350> add<00:06:24.350> subdivisions<00:06:25.160> it'd<00:06:25.639> be<00:06:26.060> a<00:06:26.330> lot

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
here add subdivisions it'd be a lot

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.719 
here add subdivisions it'd be a lot
better<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.560> had<00:06:27.800> an<00:06:28.190> image<00:06:28.430> plan

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
better if you had an image plan

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.750 
better if you had an image plan
underneath<00:06:29.150> but<00:06:29.330> i<00:06:29.540> am<00:06:30.610> showing<00:06:31.610> you

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
underneath but i am showing you

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.090 
underneath but i am showing you
technique<00:06:32.419> right<00:06:32.630> now<00:06:32.840> so<00:06:33.530> i'm<00:06:33.650> not<00:06:33.800> going<00:06:34.010> to

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
technique right now so i'm not going to

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.380 
technique right now so i'm not going to
go<00:06:34.250> dead<00:06:35.000> if<00:06:35.330> only<00:06:36.229> because<00:06:36.830> i<00:06:37.310> want<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.300> make

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
go dead if only because i want to make

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.680 
go dead if only because i want to make
this<00:06:38.570> real<00:06:38.900> short<00:06:39.350> and<00:06:40.120> you<00:06:41.120> know<00:06:41.240> easy<00:06:41.450> to

this real short and you know easy to

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.340 
this real short and you know easy to
learn<00:06:41.840> now<00:06:42.880> if<00:06:43.880> i<00:06:44.000> want<00:06:44.030> to<00:06:44.390> delete<00:06:44.690> some<00:06:44.750> edges

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
learn now if i want to delete some edges

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.460 
learn now if i want to delete some edges
to<00:06:45.800> select<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:46.400> edges<00:06:46.789> and<00:06:47.000> hit<00:06:47.539> shift<00:06:48.050> in<00:06:48.440> the

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
select the leakage do the same for these

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:10.029 
select the leakage do the same for these
and<00:07:02.389> then<00:07:03.229> police<00:07:04.210> these<00:07:05.830> you<00:07:06.830> know<00:07:06.950> I<00:07:09.039> don't

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
and then police these you know I don't

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:17.889 
and then police these you know I don't
need<00:07:10.160> these<00:07:10.340> to<00:07:11.350> this<00:07:13.720> either
