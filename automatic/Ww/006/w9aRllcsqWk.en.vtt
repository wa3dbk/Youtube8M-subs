we<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:19.100> pulley<00:00:20.570> flywheel<00:00:22.130> problem<00:00:23.130> with

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
we have the pulley flywheel problem with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.590 
we have the pulley flywheel problem with
the<00:00:23.310> flywheel<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> whole<00:00:24.300> bunch<00:00:24.510> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
really nice weights of magnets in there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.790 
really nice weights of magnets in there
and<00:00:28.349> these<00:00:28.500> magnets<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:30.029> close<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
these magnet receptors I don't know what

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
these magnet receptors I don't know what
to<00:00:34.050> call<00:00:34.079> her<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.590> God's<00:00:34.770> office<00:00:35.280> called

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
Baghdad receptors that pulls the wheel

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
Baghdad receptors that pulls the wheel
all<00:00:40.290> different<00:00:40.680> ways<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> get

all different ways and I have to get
this<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.750> teeny<00:00:43.710> tiny<00:00:43.950> slot<00:00:45.320> right<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
this little teeny tiny slot right I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
this little teeny tiny slot right I
didn't<00:00:47.489> say<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> slot<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:52.850> go<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
didn't say a slot to go right on

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.819 
didn't say a slot to go right on
this<00:00:54.829> key<00:00:55.829> key<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:57.199> now<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.440> last<00:00:58.620> few

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this key key way now in my last few

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
this key key way now in my last few
videos<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.399> gentleman<00:00:59.820> asked<00:00:59.969> me<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.629> could

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
videos the gentleman asked me if I could

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200 
videos the gentleman asked me if I could
add<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.739> more<00:01:01.829> humor<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.670> videos

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
add a little bit more humor in my videos

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
add a little bit more humor in my videos
so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:04.110> thought<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.920> while<00:01:05.040> I've

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
so I thought about that for a while I've

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
so I thought about that for a while I've
come<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:05.939> joke<00:01:06.409> even<00:01:07.409> though<00:01:07.470> I'm

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
come up with a good joke even though I'm

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
come up with a good joke even though I'm
not<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> comedian<00:01:08.100> I'll<00:01:08.430> try<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.820> say<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
not a comedian I'll try and say this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.410 
not a comedian I'll try and say this
correctly<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.520> remember<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.210> like

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
correctly and remember if you don't like

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.130 
correctly and remember if you don't like
it<00:01:13.729> I'm<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> old<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it I'm really kind of old and I don't

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.109 
it I'm really kind of old and I don't
give<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
give a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
give a
so<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.299> goes<00:01:18.890> now<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> day<00:01:21.409> when

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so here goes now back in the day when

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.429 
so here goes now back in the day when
the<00:01:22.500> British<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:22.950> an<00:01:23.040> empire<00:01:24.350> could<00:01:25.350> have

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the British had an empire could have

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.690 
the British had an empire could have
been<00:01:25.530> meaning<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.890> part<00:01:26.159> let's<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
been meaning in part let's say the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.920 
been meaning in part let's say the
British<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.030> part<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.600> did<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> lot

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
British in part because they did a lot
