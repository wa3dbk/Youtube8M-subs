gonna cover it in like a little bit and
I'm<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.180> use<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> few<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.750> these<00:04:33.900> hooks<00:04:34.260> to

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
I'm going to use a few of these hooks to

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.830 
I'm going to use a few of these hooks to
make<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.250> look<00:04:35.430> more<00:04:35.610> like<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.820> ramp<00:04:36.120> I'm<00:04:36.690> gonna

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
use pipe cleaner to attach the hooks and

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330 
use pipe cleaner to attach the hooks and
tape<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.610> hooks<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.690> bib<00:04:43.040> this<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.190> what

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
tape the hooks to the bib this is what
