00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.689
 and hello that such a youtube community my 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.580
 name is Catalan 343 this dawn 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.350
 three for three industry and proud of 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.450
 his work gave us the opportunity to 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.670
 know a small general revelation 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.830
 about his new title to come and it comes 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.840
 of the five guardians though for more 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.700
 comfort and focus I 'll call them already and the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 five guardians throughout the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.690
 development of my videos notice that hey 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.580
 the five guardians would be the first 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.800
 title in the central backgammon games 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.050
 ice in having a subtitle from halo 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.390
 combative and start as in the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.550
 old times the story of the game is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 a total mystery and leaving them this in 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.809
 clear nothing about it was revealed the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.699
 today the biggest clue is that 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.829
 apparently what we saw in the trailer 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.109
 of the last e3 was not fully a 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.940
 commercial trailer and if it showed events 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.949
 that at some point will happen in the game 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.749
 but not necessarily in the way that 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.789
 were shown what I want to say is 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.620
 that the boss always enters a machine 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.260
 bird type four runner but simply 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 maybe not in a desert and maybe not 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 using a huge pony rose poncho 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.749
 general manager between three 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.400
 industries revealed to us the greatness of 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.720
 game that you have developing your 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.790
 words for an exact 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.190
 the next hey the five is a 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.140
 effort greater than hello 4 this applies the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.730
 content and approach of the game as well 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.680
 technology as it is a 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.170
 totally new game with one more engine 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.060
 certainly powerful some elements 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.830
 of the game kernel that we have loaded 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.270
 since previous games but we have 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.160
 invested a great effort in 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.020
 reorganize our technology to 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.880
 take full advantage of the team and 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 ecosystem to create worlds and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.870
 worthwhile experiences in 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.670
 next generation also added that 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.010
 the game will run at 60 frames per second 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.290
 on dedicated servers providing a 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240
 approach and scale of which you have dreamed of 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.580
 there more than a decade thanks to the new 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.229
 game engine for those who are not very 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.000
 in the subject a game engine is 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.400
 basically the core that the creators 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 of games used to create games due to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 that companies must pay a large 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.860
 sum of money usually to use 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.200
 fire engines registered in a 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 public project are usually held 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.430
 to use the first one that they acquire in addition 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.110
 that makes life a lot easier 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.240
 When creating a new game 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.369
 same series using code has already done 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.110
 previously in the same way 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.450
 he stated that if the five guardians was 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.819
 the most ambitious title leave it up 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.160
 showing amounts of content ever 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.170
 thought realistically in a game of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 halo we would apparently have the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.849
 variety of enemy weapons locations and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 larger vehicles never seen in a 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.510
 halo game all this also under the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.790
 promise that the game will be a world 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.650
 very very big we do not know anything about 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.090
 multiplayer or the campaign but we were 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.580
 gave a couple of clues by saying that the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.620
 map will have a huge scale we do not know 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.900
 if this refers to a semi open world 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.489
 without being completely or simply a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.709
 play area superior to what we have 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.840
 seen at some previous point all this 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.730
 will have to be confirmed and of course I know 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440
 treat them in videos to conclude with 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 the words of laying eggs she 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.090
 He said we'll know more about this game in 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.370
 the e3 2014 that you will develop on 19 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.860
 June at 9 a.m. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 peaceful is to say 11-m of the hour of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.390
 center of mexico and about 1 or 2 pm 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.370
 from countries beyond South America 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.380
 but here is one of the pieces of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.329
 most interesting information of all the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.940
 I 've heard the game today 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.720
 will have its output in the fall of 2015 is 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.640
 say beyond a year from 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.770
 now but nevertheless three four trim 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.740
 23 maintains that the trip leave it in the 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.510
 xbox one will continue to start this 2014 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.950
 so much is not more information about it 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.200
 in this event e3 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.700
 that basically leaves us the doors 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.740
 open to see a hello 2 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 anniversary later this year if I 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.880
 they ask me in addition for sources 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.190
 filtered something old we know that this 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.440
 could well exist and not only that but 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 also contain a pass for the sale of 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.000
 the five guardians and a fragment of 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.890
 very, very important information is 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.020
 that the game will be exclusively for 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 the xbox one regarding the information 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.560
 that's all, but let's give it a 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.480
 look at the confirmation image by 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.190
 a second the first thing I will say about them 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.170
 that are in a desert such as the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.000
 revelation trailer of the last e3 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.740
 but I just want to make this clear and 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.630
 which is the most irrelevant detail of the 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.400
 picture we see what appear to be two 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.170
 spartans in the bottom the boss 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.910
 teacher and at the top one 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.650
 mysterious expert I can insinuate that 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.540
 both are the same person the boss 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.040
 teacher even though one has rifles 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.560
 of battle and the other assault rifle 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.209
 this can still be true since 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.780
 we know that at the end of halo 4 the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.209
 armor 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.070
 She was a teacher but is removed 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.750
 we also know thanks to hello scale 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.610
 edition that the boss continued using the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.310
 same armor in later events 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.290
 so we have no affirmation of anything 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.389
 I heard some people say that they 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.340
 leave from above it could well be palmer 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.410
 although this is discarded immediately 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.570
 to see that the body belongs to a 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.090
 male I told myself only with two 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.980
 theories more or is a is new part whose 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.020
 history in name and purposes still 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.820
 we must discover and also play a role 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.130
 of the new master's mate or 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 well just a spartan that we 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.610
 we can customize to feel that 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.590
 we are the biggest part of history 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.720
 of the master team in one more way 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.760
 close honestly I would like more than 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.440
 was a new character since I never 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.870
 I wanted to see as a halo character 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.970
 but as a good spectator enjoying 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.800
 of a good narrative and take my 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.930
 character only to the sands 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.060
 multiplayer but it's likely that 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.150
 if it is a new character due 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.490
 to a single thing the icon of the n-ii in 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.470
 your chest the onu and it will probably be 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.720
 hostile to the boss or teacher because of 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.490
 his dealings with jose and the fact that he is 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.270
 fiercely wants to find to cut 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 maybe 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.160
 new antagonist that remains to be seen in 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.480
 the right side of the spar so superior 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.220
 we can see structures that 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.650
 they are definitely of a formation 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.840
 natural as I would say it will cut if not 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.790
 they were dead they do not look of origin 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.380
 human, but because of the environment 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.660
 I can imply that they are simply 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.670
 last forerunner structures there are 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.890
 that analyze your title and the five 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.870
 guardians regards we will be 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.730
 guardians as in destiny of course not 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.950
 guardians gives me some connection with the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.780
 lining walk for some reason but to 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.210
 be a guardian you must be protecting 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.220
 something but cut it several times it 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.320
 he referred to the master chief as his guardian 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.480
 protector but in this case it would be called 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.370
 more than the five guardians and that the 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.320
 five guardians being a word 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.630
 plural who are the guardians 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.610
 they leave the boss we do not know they can 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.500
 say that I'm going deep with 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.090
 the title but decipher it could we 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.740
 give a good concept of the story 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.600
 perhaps guardians of the loss 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.270
 forerunner technology not the 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.770
 you do not know we do not know the last 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.180
 detail that I want to add is that 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.070
 transporten industry said that the 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.230
 multiplayer of this game is being 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.420
 Carefully careful to be the best 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.820
 halo multiplayer never seen before 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.800
 but nevertheless apparently we are 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.720
 point to see the best full of 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.520
 content and long campaign example 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.500
 to date and one thing that I want 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.360
 clarify by the way is that frank o'connor 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.700
 confirmed that despite its revealer 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.230
 cover if the five guardians will have 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.260
 boss the teacher as his character 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.210
 playable and protagonist and nobody nobody what 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.160
 will be replacing however not 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.110
 revealed nothing about the use of 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.210
 simultaneous characters as we saw it 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.530
 in gilo 2 with the inquisitor or as 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.870
 infidel other audio steel with the 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.330
 Squadron of SSD soldiers and this 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.190
