00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
seats and we did this basically because

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420 
seats and we did this basically because
the<00:03:12.690> interior<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> show<00:03:13.860> car<00:03:14.190> went<00:03:14.370> over

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the interior of the show car went over

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.460 
the interior of the show car went over
so<00:03:14.760> well<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.569> decided<00:03:16.080> we<00:03:16.170> would<00:03:16.319> offer

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so well that we decided we would offer

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.570 
so well that we decided we would offer
this<00:03:16.680> as<00:03:16.890> an<00:03:17.010> option<00:03:18.410> there<00:03:19.410> are<00:03:19.620> obviously<00:03:20.459> a

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
this as an option there are obviously a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.089 
this as an option there are obviously a
lot<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.910> these<00:03:21.019> door<00:03:22.019> panels<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.560> such<00:03:22.769> look

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
lot of these door panels and such look

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.069 
lot of these door panels and such look
like<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> production<00:03:23.880> door<00:03:24.090> panel<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.900> is

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
like a production door panel this is

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.720 
like a production door panel this is
actually<00:03:25.500> sprayed<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.010> right<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.459> last

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
actually sprayed on right now the last

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.729 
actually sprayed on right now the last
thing<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.269> grain<00:03:27.540> our<00:03:27.690> our<00:03:28.110> interior

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
thing we do is grain our our interior

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.009 
thing we do is grain our our interior
parts<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.519> process<00:03:30.090> hasn't<00:03:30.569> been<00:03:30.840> done

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
parts so that process hasn't been done

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.050 
parts so that process hasn't been done
yet<00:03:31.079> because<00:03:31.650> we<00:03:31.950> want<00:03:32.160> everything<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.880> match

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
yet because we want everything to match

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.690 
yet because we want everything to match
exactly<00:03:33.599> right<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:35.010> reason<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.489> can't

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
exactly right so the reason we can't

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.160 
exactly right so the reason we can't
legend<00:03:36.030> here<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.450> SAT<00:03:36.690> interrupt<00:03:37.019> on

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
legend here is if you SAT interrupt on

this this will eventually come off we
don't<00:03:38.910> want<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.329> happen<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.489> is

don't want that to happen but this is

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.490 
don't want that to happen but this is
pretty<00:03:41.819> much<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.420> production<00:03:42.870> attempt<00:03:43.230> these
