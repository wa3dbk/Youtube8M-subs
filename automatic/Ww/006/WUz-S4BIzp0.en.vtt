two years ago the thing is in tenish
it's<00:00:57.600> always<00:00:57.899> matters<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> confidence<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.510> I

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
it's always matters of confidence and I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's always matters of confidence and I
could<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.309> tonight<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:03.030> playing<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.420> very

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
could see tonight I was playing a very

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.800 
could see tonight I was playing a very
nice<00:01:03.930> tennis<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.949> sometimes<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> had<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
nice tennis but sometimes when I had to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260 
nice tennis but sometimes when I had to
finish<00:01:07.049> i<00:01:07.350> pled<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.890> bad<00:01:08.490> games<00:01:08.729> beginning

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
finish i pled some bad games beginning

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
finish i pled some bad games beginning
of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> second<00:01:09.960> set<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:13.280> wasn't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of the second set and that I wasn't

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.490 
of the second set and that I wasn't
doing<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.000> mean<00:01:15.900> two<00:01:16.110> years<00:01:16.259> ago<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.180> I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
doing it I mean two years ago and I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
doing it I mean two years ago and I
think<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.770> come<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.580> machen

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
think it will come back with the machen

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
think it will come back with the machen
with<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> victory<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.560> very

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
with the victory so that's why it's very

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.460 
with the victory so that's why it's very
good<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> win<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> need<00:01:26.009> also

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
good to win here and I think I need also

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.020 
good to win here and I think I need also
one<00:01:28.470> big<00:01:28.740> match<00:01:28.920> against<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.700> top<00:01:29.970> player<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
one big match against a top player the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
one big match against a top player the
the<00:01:33.030> last<00:01:33.240> time<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> played<00:01:33.600> them<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.500> lost<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the last time I played them I lost to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.170 
the last time I played them I lost to
murray<00:01:35.970> nadal<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.140> djokovic<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:38.400> three<00:01:38.939> sets

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
murray nadal and djokovic in three sets

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.039 
murray nadal and djokovic in three sets
straight<00:01:39.810> every<00:01:40.380> time<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.049> do

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
straight every time so I need to do

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
straight every time so I need to do
better<00:01:43.170> than<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:44.399> he<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.790> being<00:01:45.030> very

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
better than that when he was being very

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
better than that when he was being very
good<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.140> mean<00:01:49.790> sometimes<00:01:50.790> very

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
good it was a I mean sometimes very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.300 
good it was a I mean sometimes very
aggressive<00:01:51.840> sometimes<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.799> defending

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
aggressive sometimes it was defending

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
aggressive sometimes it was defending
while<00:01:53.750> also<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:56.430> thing<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.880> tonight<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
while also the thing is I tonight I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
while also the thing is I tonight I
think<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.140> didn't<00:01:58.439> serve<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:58.950> good<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.610> was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
think we didn't serve very good it was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780 
think we didn't serve very good it was
how<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> serve<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> night<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.520> dark

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
how to serve with the night was so dark

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
how to serve with the night was so dark
I<00:02:02.880> mean<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.439> nine<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.740> Australia<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I mean know if nine in Australia is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.069 
I mean know if nine in Australia is
always<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.869> difficult

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
always like this but it was so difficult

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.719 
always like this but it was so difficult
to<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> board<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
to see the board and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.729 
to see the board and
but<00:02:10.360> then<00:02:10.569> after<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:11.110> were<00:02:11.230> playing<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.590> very

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
but then after we were playing a very

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.740 
but then after we were playing a very
nice<00:02:12.010> tennis<00:02:12.250> from<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> baseline<00:02:12.909> and<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> was

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
nice tennis from the baseline and it was

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.509 
nice tennis from the baseline and it was
a<00:02:14.530> real<00:02:15.370> fight<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.379> I'm<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.920> happy<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.340> win

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.360 
a real fight and I'm just happy to win
it<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:18.760> Victor<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.450> playing<00:02:20.349> better<00:02:21.190> and
