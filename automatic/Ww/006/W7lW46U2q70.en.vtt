00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.790 
by side stuff a little bit of contact
there<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.660> then<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.840> realized<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.620> still

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
there but then I realized I was still

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.020 
there but then I realized I was still
there<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.100> he<00:03:05.190> drifted<00:03:05.459> out<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> little<00:03:05.790> bit<00:03:05.940> of

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
there but he drifted out a little bit of

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.070 
there but he drifted out a little bit of
wide<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.739> lap<00:03:08.160> seven<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:08.910> got<00:03:09.180> Ben

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.350 
wide now on lap seven we have got Ben
and<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.800> Dan<00:03:11.070> both<00:03:11.519> making<00:03:12.000> slight

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and I think Dan both making slight

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.479 
and I think Dan both making slight
mistakes<00:03:12.840> here<00:03:13.110> because<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.380> think<00:03:13.739> Ben<00:03:14.220> his

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
mistakes here because I think Ben his

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.060 
mistakes here because I think Ben his
lost<00:03:14.790> his<00:03:15.000> front<00:03:15.330> wing<00:03:15.510> here<00:03:15.860> apparently<00:03:16.860> he

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
back of Dan and this is the lap I was

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.830 
back of Dan and this is the lap I was
going<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.670> pit<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.239> my<00:03:30.420> tires<00:03:30.690> were

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
going to pit because my tires were

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.600 
going to pit because my tires were
completely<00:03:31.410> destroy<00:03:31.920> at<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.190> point<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.489> was

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
completely destroy at this point I was

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.360 
completely destroy at this point I was
pushing<00:03:32.850> them<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.440> decided<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:35.040> pit<00:03:35.250> on

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
pushing them so much I decided to pit on

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.400 
pushing them so much I decided to pit on
this<00:03:35.519> lap<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.970> was<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.750> hoping<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.290> was

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
this lap I was really hoping that I was

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.690 
this lap I was really hoping that I was
gonna<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.620> enough<00:03:37.799> big<00:03:38.100> enough<00:03:38.310> gap<00:03:38.519> anh

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
gonna have enough big enough gap anh

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.979 
gonna have enough big enough gap anh
danh<00:03:38.940> because<00:03:39.209> obviously<00:03:39.329> he's<00:03:39.660> going<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.900> be

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
danh because obviously he's going to be

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
danh because obviously he's going to be
coming<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.350> pits<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.739> his<00:03:40.860> lap<00:03:41.010> as<00:03:41.190> well<00:03:41.400> so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
coming in the pits on his lap as well so

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.910 
coming in the pits on his lap as well so
that's<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.480> bit<00:03:42.630> risky<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.590> did<00:03:43.739> have

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
that's a bit risky but I really did have

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.620 
that's a bit risky but I really did have
to<00:03:44.070> pick<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.400> lap<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:45.450> we're

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
here on lap 10 off thinking that going

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.400 
here on lap 10 off thinking that going
for<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> move<00:04:36.450> their<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:37.020> not<00:04:37.230> gonna

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
for the move their but I was not gonna

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.040 
for the move their but I was not gonna
be<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> gap<00:04:37.980> there<00:04:38.010> whatsoever<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.480> had<00:04:39.840> died

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
be a gap there whatsoever and had died

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.720 
be a gap there whatsoever and had died
down<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.410> insight<00:04:40.680> into<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.100> DRS<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:41.640> I

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
down the insight into the DRS and I

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.400 
down the insight into the DRS and I
think<00:04:41.940> we're<00:04:42.090> going<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.270> grab<00:04:42.570> DRS<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.200> well

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
think we're going to grab DRS as well

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.930 
think we're going to grab DRS as well
he's<00:04:43.800> trying<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.100> get<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.400> cut<00:04:44.610> back<00:04:44.790> we've

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
he's trying to get the cut back we've

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.810 
he's trying to get the cut back we've
got<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.570> curse<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.710> DRS<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.730> they're

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
got the curse and the DRS so they're

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.340 
got the curse and the DRS so they're
gonna<00:04:47.910> easily<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.480> able<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.720> pull<00:04:48.900> away<00:04:48.990> down

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
gonna easily be able to pull away down

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.290 
gonna easily be able to pull away down
the<00:04:49.500> specs<00:04:49.830> right<00:04:50.160> hopefully<00:04:50.670> enough<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.210> a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the specs right hopefully enough of a

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.030 
the specs right hopefully enough of a
gap<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.630> he<00:04:51.690> doesn't<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.290> know<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.770> can't
