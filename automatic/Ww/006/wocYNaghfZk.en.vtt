 by the way, visitors in isolation in the third place 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.839
 it reduces 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.719
 maybe even my entry into the couturier group behind with the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.719

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.930
 unwind to guerrilla prost 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.420

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 prototypes must keep his second place 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.400

 in e1 - vic-fezensac with the villeneuve who almost lost his sixth place 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.310
