00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.580
 hello to all of you it's mr le 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 meygal and so no I did not leave 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 youtube i was just on vacation because 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.300
 that youtube youtube 2 has the right to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.570
 take a few short holidays and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 so we will resume everything 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.929
 gently a little tutorial so this tutorial 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 it's to hide a body I explain myself 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.859
 at the microphones place then we will 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.609
 probably know the fans neither 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.000
 kingdoms 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.519
 that's fine as I find or so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.960
 the battles hide everything again what 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.170
 whether it's actually all he decides 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.809
 to break a passionate cash and hide 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.699
 a body and well this technique and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.050
 poor talent well it's not me 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.850
 who invented it years ago but it's not me 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.640
 so this is just a little house 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.899
 banal just as well so it goes like that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.329
 it disturbs me very simply there is nothing 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.750
 of course normal it's basic it's all 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.880
 normal it's a small and indoors 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.549
 also everything has come everything is normal except 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.000
 that at i on your blog and sumo blocked 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.869
 here we do not see what it is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 hidden chest or that there is there I can 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.670
 tidy up my things take them in my 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 inventory 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 we will eat more hop I will 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.100
 put up in then and now 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 how to do this is very recent 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.579
 of a camp the courage of all agree 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.450
 all agree yes all agree 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.149
 first of all where do we start with a small 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.310
 pc game a little bit everything is actually three 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.240
 stacked cubes so wanted to do that with 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 any white wood color 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.520
 war all you do to us that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 of the door since one to the porsche so 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.130
 introduce you to the three you take 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 a hippie style this rate but that sticks 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.040
 not round 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.159
 and you make it look in the direction 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 from the bottom then you take a rail you 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.340
 ask it except that I do not know that one 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.750
 importance but good every time 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.209
 I do it like that it does not work 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:37.579
 it does not have to be that way and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.319
 we put a car with a co kr so 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.609
 then we must break the judgment of 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.500
 below except that if you look this is 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.750
 impossible to break and so you have to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.690
 dig a hole puts in 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.079
 and here you see it's bleeding 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.079
 relief 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.629
 I explain to you after the goal is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.909
 activated it will go down and the board goes 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.069
 sinking into the coffers and suddenly 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.599
 it's going to hide and if you do not have it 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.010
 rai underneath industry that track does not 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.480
 do not go 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.680
 yes I say sticky precisely next 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.319
 world it's just a piston so has the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 plunger that he's gonna he's not going to walk himself 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.439
 hurt laughing put the block next 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 and we activate everything and we pray that it 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.530
 market 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.750
 and now they concede the ground 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.650
 that's where each time we go 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.139
 start again and some leaves like 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.310
 that sometimes but good blues bolton 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:45.440
 start again the course starts is strong 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:57.080
 I joke called men and three 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:04:09.030
 disks the rails the body calling him 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:09.510
 we break first of all I've been good at 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.450
 touch 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:19.709
 it has to work and it's great 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.980
 then you can call it done 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.390
 so where do you go to see that 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.370
 but there is only one place where it does not 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.640
 not exceed so you look for the place 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:39.330
 this is our right it is there and you 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:42.000
 hide the rest here you can 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.230
 make your breakfast a block 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.230
 front to tell me also that they have 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.230
 not the luxury 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:15.360
 No, because here is a snake 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.950
 of luxury so if you do not want this 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.870
 be really camouflaged a party 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.370
 still a row behind this is that the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.000
 red opponents to believe as if the 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.000
 wall of your house 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.870
 I am really good 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:58.160
 we will put gantries are 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:06.349
 doors 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:06.349
 the trend 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.430
 and I 'm already going there it's there you are 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.100
 get closer hop here is your body you 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.350
 can put touch you can everything 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.260
 put in or 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.100
 I have nothing more about me I'm naked not 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.440
 of clothes yet sir and I can 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.750
 all resume and what is very close 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.460
 what is very advantageous is that your 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:40.180
 opponents if that word right next they 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:42.160
 do not hear those we hear the 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.060
 chest is great but that opens then 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.760
 that where does not hear it here I hope 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.120
 that this tutorial will have us more and that they 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.260
 help with fat and then we will end up 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:00.400
 the next one is for the mario sequel 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.230
 sorry or for how is it going 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.290
 west heaths that's gonna hello all the 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.290
 world
