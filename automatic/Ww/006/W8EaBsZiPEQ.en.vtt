00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:13.070
 the law stands still. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.740
 swim so what is the principle of focus wire 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.180
 which comes from the starter 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:24.720
 distributor lies on the mass 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 years they turnover booty on the wire stupidly 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:40.520
 lies on mass pierce merida now 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:40.520
 Let's remove the wire to put here and 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 roles from thousands of kilometers no one could 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:01.649
 guess for the year for some reason could you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 one glove could do here 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:12.029
 now we take our mount 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:15.719
 or for some hose and not 

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:18.389
 dielectric here we fasten tibet 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.429
 dielectric here this wire like this 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.709
 apparatus but in general this one here this 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.179
 wire or 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:26.179
 need to replace one 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:42.780
 and that here it is about the miracle of the engine 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:49.679
 fold over the mass to make sure 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 here we throw on the mass and here they are 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.890
 are starting 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.380
 here it is the solution to the human action here 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.939
 they swam and died and that's when she's three 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.939
 starts to swim even harder 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.420
 here you drove 300 kilometers it's ok I'm 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.540
 such a pattern 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.040
 what are you doing here what are you doing here 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.040
 just recommends 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.780
 so here it is great and terrible mazda 323
