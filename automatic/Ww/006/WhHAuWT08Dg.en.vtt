00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the beginning of the game just a force

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.479 
the beginning of the game just a force
that<00:02:27.310> he<00:02:27.790> was<00:02:27.940> playing<00:02:28.209> with<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.250> what

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
that he was playing with and it was what

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.490 
that he was playing with and it was what
we<00:02:30.640> talked<00:02:30.909> about<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.629> all<00:02:31.780> talk<00:02:32.079> now<00:02:32.290> we've

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
we talked about we all talk now we've

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.309 
we talked about we all talk now we've
been<00:02:32.530> talking<00:02:33.220> about<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.579> is<00:02:34.140> Miami<00:02:35.140> has

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
been talking about it is Miami has

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.319 
been talking about it is Miami has
played<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.799> force<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:37.060> what<00:02:37.180> they

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
played with force and that's what they

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.699 
played with force and that's what they
should<00:02:37.569> do<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.640> haven't<00:02:39.909> and<00:02:40.470> today<00:02:41.470> there

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
should do but we haven't and today there

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.259 
should do but we haven't and today there
was<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.829> stretch<00:02:42.160> with<00:02:42.310> both<00:02:42.549> teams<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.000> plan

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
was a stretch with both teams to plan

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.869 
was a stretch with both teams to plan
with<00:02:43.450> force<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.959> was<00:02:44.109> fine<00:02:44.319> with<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.879> but

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
with force and I was fine with that but

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.059 
with force and I was fine with that but
I<00:02:46.000> thought<00:02:46.180> Paul<00:02:46.540> set<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.530> tone<00:02:47.739> for<00:02:47.769> our

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
I thought Paul set the tone for our

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.670 
I thought Paul set the tone for our
entire<00:02:48.430> team<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.940> start<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.329> game<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:50.109> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
entire team to start the game with the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.500 
entire team to start the game with the
force<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.040> he<00:02:51.370> played<00:02:51.670> with<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.150> thought<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
force that he played with I thought that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.210 
force that he played with I thought that
was<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> great<00:02:53.140> message<00:02:53.379> for<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.769> entire<00:02:54.040> to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
was a great message for the entire to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.069 
was a great message for the entire to
Miami<00:02:54.640> still<00:02:54.940> leads<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.299> series<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.049> one

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
Miami still leads the series to to one

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.750 
Miami still leads the series to to one
