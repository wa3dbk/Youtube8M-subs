00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
and there you have it a humza flashed a

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.750 
and there you have it a humza flashed a
tube<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.290> went<00:02:35.500> ahead<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.980> did<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.549> same

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
process to my next design the only

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.399 
process to my next design the only
difference<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.750> decided<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
difference is that I decided to

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.530 
difference is that I decided to
incorporate<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.280> little<00:02:42.670> bit<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.879> gold<00:02:43.120> glitter
