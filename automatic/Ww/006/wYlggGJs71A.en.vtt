00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 friend of the new hunt is today I bring 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.910
 news about the avengers 2 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.790
 that was present in the panel 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.340
 marvel of the comic-con de san diego 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 The first thing I can show you is a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 poster that was the sum of a few 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 posters that were composing a puzzle 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.769
 a mosaic in which we can see the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 main protagonists of the second 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 delivery facing off with copies of the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 bad of this delivery the throne and I 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.180
 would like to highlight a character that we see 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.879
 at the bottom in the poster that is the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.879
 confirmation without a doubt that in this 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.480
 second delivery we can see the vision 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 the android to which lend voice and body 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 actor paul bettany and that is one of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 members at least in the comics of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.180
 the avengers can also see a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.430
 teaser trailer of the movie which does not 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.800
 I've been lucky to see but yes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.860
 I read what was seen in it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 happens to write or it seems that in the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 teaser trailer you can see a scene 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 relaxed in which all the members 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 of the team are among one more trying 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.430
 of raising the hammer of thor and that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.050
 this animated and cheerful scene 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.659
 interrupted with the appearance of a 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 throne in the same teaser trailer seems 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.100
 that we can see a scene in which 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.500
 fight jules against ironman in a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.860
 armor designed especially for 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.710
 deal with the emerald giant and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.369
 finally we can see the aspect that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.409
 will look like the bad bad guy who 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.060
 we can see in the third installment of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.729
 the Avengers 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.560
 you have to find another george rolling 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 that also went through the panel 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.300
 marvel sheathing the blissful 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.539
 infinity gauntlet that in the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.180
 third installment of the saga you will see 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.340
 what is it about nothing else on my part dale 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.840
 I like it uploaded to our channel 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.130
 the videos from not people to be 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.130
 the last one then
