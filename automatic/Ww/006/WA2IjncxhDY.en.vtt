00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.690
 most people do not consume 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.969
 enough fiber as they should and it's a 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.980
 pity because it offers many benefits 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.070
 the fiber of course helps with the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.470
 digestive process high food in 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.060
 fiber are substantial and fiber supports 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.670
 the growth of bacteria and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.380
 beneficial in the digestive tract but 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.750
 Not all fibers work 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.120
 exactly the same and that's why we talk about 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.390
 two types of fibers soluble fibers 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.760
 and insoluble as the name 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.829
 suggests the soluble fibers are that is 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.100
 Dissolve in water 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.320
 and resolved become thick has 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.449
 prepared oatmeal at home has probably 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.269
 seen that when cooking it gets thick and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.070
 sticky this is because the fiber 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.079
 soluble in oats dissolves in the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.510
 liquid which makes your oatmeal a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.219
 little sticky when these fibers have 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.100
 contact with the liquid in your stomach 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.379
 they expand and thicken so what 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.360
 keeps the soluble fiber satisfied 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.310
 It also has the kind of fiber that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.860
 healthy bacteria in the tract 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.659
 lower digestive like to consume and 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.420
 promotes the multiplication of these 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.520
 beneficial bacteria the fibers 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.770
 insolubles also support the health of your 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.170
 digestive system but the different 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.940
 way the insoluble fibers are not 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.890
 Dissolve in water instead 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.200
 they just absorb the water in the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.899
 lower tract what makes fiber 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.640
 more voluminous this type of fiber is 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.799
 found in most vegetables 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.899
 and whole grains and helps 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.179
 accelerate the passage of debris from your 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.310
 digestive system to help you with the 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.140
 regularity maybe you have never thought of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.780
 but it is actually quite easy 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.730
 identify the two fibers when you 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.650
 prepare soups of the week 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.600
 potatoes can easily see how it 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 thickens the liquid this is because the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 barley and potatoes are high in fiber 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.340
 soluble when they prepare brown rice 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.770
 what is rich in insoluble fiber is not 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.780
 it gets sticky just absorbs the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.600
 water while cooking making the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.430
 grain swell look how it compares 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.160
 canned corn with beans 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.650
 canned both are packaged with water 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.930
 but liquids look different from 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.420
 corn is a grain and most of its 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.940
 fiber is insoluble so the liquid 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.120
 of the can looks very similar to water not 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.400
 It is thick or sticky but if you look at 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.500
 canned beans that were packaged 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.230
 in water you can see that the liquid is more 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.060
 thick this is because the fiber 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.770
 soluble in water has expressed the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.200
 liquid where the beans are 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.300
 since your body needs two types of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.430
 fiber is better to consume a broad 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.070
 variety of fruits vegetables beans and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.780
 whole grains will not only get the two 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.030
 types of fiber but it also 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.980
 will benefit from mineral vitamins and 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.030
 antioxidants that these foods 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.030
 healthy contain
