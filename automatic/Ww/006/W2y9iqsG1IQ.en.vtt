00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 well we have done an exercise we are going to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 an exercise with Manuel Marquez of the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.420
 possible rivals of the aura of the canelo 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.019
 álvarez and the set as max maker 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.469
 I would be giving him what he could do that 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 the rivals 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.910
 martínez 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 September 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.250
 after a time difference I 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 I think what he has to do is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 face a dangerous opponent but not from 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.100
 the danger of martínez wonder or 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 of the clear or the same Carlos Molina 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 tamayo the yellow in his program 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.280
 March will face the dog or avid ortiz 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.280
 the dog is not at its best 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:10.640
 has created problems and I believe that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.690
 I would also like víctor ortiz ortiz 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.550
 practically takes simply 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.920
 inactivity that was a point 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.870
 important for the canelo álvarez a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.080
 take the pace to take the distance now 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.979
 possibly take again the path of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.880
 triumph would be for March September and I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.170
 would possibly make the fight against 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.170
 sergio maravilla martínez 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.060
 maravilla martínez is a fighter who already 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.060
 he proved it everyone knows 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.490
 what is going on wonder martínez 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.700
 it catches my attention because like wimax 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.470
 then wearing quiet protecting 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.720
 to your presidential figure 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.670
 to what I'm going to what I'm going to what's coming 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.800
 is that the activity can affect a 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.080
 fighter very good as a voter 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.849
 mayweather and after six months of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 inactivity and face it to sergio 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.000
 original martínez wonder and nothing or the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:31.640
 himself carlos molina is not usually healthy 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.440
 for alternate martinez of the difficulty 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.610
 of wonder martínez or nothing difficulty 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.190
 the Cuban fighter of the same among others 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.959
 but they are there waiting for the opportunity 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.420
 but hey, I had what I 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.360
 would reduce this program from external angle 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.690
 for March 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.150
 for September to July forgiveness of your 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.819
 maravilla martínez and for November already 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.470
 it would be Carlos Molina 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:05.330
 the winner of what would be the clear that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.950
 he also has another great fight but if 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.020
 Give a little air to cinnamon and 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.940
 again take the rhythm and take the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.560
 distance in front of an opponent from above 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720
 of the quadrilateral are points 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.250
 important because they can not be groups 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.610
 of facing big animal points 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.610
 danger 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.019
 molina 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.019
 yes she very good 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.080
 Molina is very difficult because of its 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.730
 most decipherable key style is but 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.989
 was about to knock no no no no the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.260
 sang the air for some that was 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.209
 latent the angle of an eye that was 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 a fight but he wore it very well 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.410
 then Carlos Molina imagined himself new 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.540
 most dangerous opponent to leave them for 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.640
 cash that has a style and decipher 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.860
 we have already seen it great and erislandy 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.720
 lara is also a more technical style a 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.480
 style where the trajectory of blows 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.340
 comes very well treated and it seems that there 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:15.280
 the differences of styles between mill 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:17.109
 aguilar claro and superwelter I think that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.079
 is what the cinnamon needs to face 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.669
 the best and now I'm with art and 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.210
 there in the future face big 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.010
 fights 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.680
 let's review then how would it be 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.060
 the calendar that our brother Manuel 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.300
 armed marquez 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.360
 the canelo álvarez March 8, Victor 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.790
 ortiz alfredo the dog angle 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.960
 otherwise it would be very commercial because 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.820
 are you talking about who is a figure 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 mexicana that we commercially speaking 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.990
 and víctor is the representation of the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.990
 Mexican-Americans also with this 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.610
 is guaranteed but both fighters 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.340
 are not at their best clear this 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
 day would be as a couple in the beginning to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.139
 take the lean start to take the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.360
 trust in him again and after 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.550
 face the best law that would be sergio 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 wonder martínez and then we see the 20 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.520
 of November 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.090
 Carlos Molina will fly with the style of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:17.410
 both fighters I think it will be better 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:19.690
 because the blow takes it out where 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.180
 practically then a good man 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.790
 worked as marked by the art of 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.530
 cooking and coils does not take it out as if 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.030
 outside hook or do not have any 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.030
 trajectory those blows 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.639
 John attention that computes as tone what 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.250
 would you put it because I think the cost is 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.139
 an opponent and so that the cinnamon starts to 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.669
 take that life for me would be two with 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 that will be planted with martínez wonder 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.440
 wonder martínez of where style 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.169
 also in tv and style and I think that 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.449
 would have more credibility to beat a 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.150
 fighter good yet did his last 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.389
 fight won he won 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.789
 this one of the beagle but hey did not have 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.460
 opposition and in this case against 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:18.940
 wonder will be different will have a great 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:22.180
 triumph and prove to the people that you 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.860
 gave a lot of experience for him because 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.860
 any fighter 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.570
 and he has touched the bells have saved us 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.980
 but good has been good 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.980
 calendar that with manuel marquez
