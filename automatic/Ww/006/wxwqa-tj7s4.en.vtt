Ewing I don't know if this is gonna be a
trilogy<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:36.000> think

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
trilogy or not but I just don't think

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
trilogy or not but I just don't think
I'm<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> continuing<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.860> wasn't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I'm going to be continuing I wasn't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
I'm going to be continuing I wasn't
thrilled<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.840> only<00:00:39.870> reason<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
thrilled with this one the only reason I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
thrilled with this one the only reason I
would<00:00:40.950> continue<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.210> has<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
would continue is because this has a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.350 
would continue is because this has a
really<00:00:42.719> shitty<00:00:43.200> cliffhanger<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
really shitty cliffhanger and it just is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.979 
really shitty cliffhanger and it just is
in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> middle<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> action<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.629> like

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
in the middle of the action so it's like

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
in the middle of the action so it's like
yeah<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.030> happens

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
yeah I kind of want to know what happens

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
yeah I kind of want to know what happens
but<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> might<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.860> after

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
but I might just look it up after

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
but I might just look it up after
because<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> wasn't<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.239> thrilled<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.840> wasn't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
because I wasn't that thrilled I wasn't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
because I wasn't that thrilled I wasn't
really<00:00:55.230> attached<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> characters<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
really attached to the characters or the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.229 
really attached to the characters or the
world<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.809> anything<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.699> know

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
world or anything so I don't know

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
world or anything so I don't know
next<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.930> pretty<00:01:01.410> positive<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.489> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
next one I'm pretty positive I'm not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
next one I'm pretty positive I'm not
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.879> finishing<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.080> the

actually wrote the other books quite a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
actually wrote the other books quite a
while<00:01:14.880> after<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:15.930> published<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
while after this one was published and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
while after this one was published and
I'm<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.610> interested<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.240> continuing<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I'm just not interested in continuing I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
I'm just not interested in continuing I
liked<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> ending<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
liked the ending of this one and I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
liked the ending of this one and I
thought<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.640> I

the Maze Runner by James Dashner I just

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.090 
the Maze Runner by James Dashner I just
have<00:03:26.970> no<00:03:27.150> interest<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.900> finding<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.740> what

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
have no interest in finding out what

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.040 
have no interest in finding out what
happens<00:03:29.610> after<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> end<00:03:30.300> because<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> didn't

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
happens after the end because I didn't

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.890 
happens after the end because I didn't
like<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.410> ending<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.300> thought<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> was

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
like the ending I just I thought it was

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.200 
like the ending I just I thought it was
rushed<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.590> thought<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.160> was<00:03:35.310> very<00:03:35.520> predictable

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
rushed I thought it was very predictable

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.670 
rushed I thought it was very predictable
and<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.470> I'm<00:03:38.370> not<00:03:38.430> interested<00:03:39.210> so<00:03:39.240> no<00:03:40.080> and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and I just I'm not interested so no and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770 
and I just I'm not interested so no and
the<00:03:41.010> final<00:03:41.340> one<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.520> one<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.270> I'm<00:03:42.390> kind<00:03:42.660> of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
the final one is one that I'm kind of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.570 
the final one is one that I'm kind of
mixed<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.950> under<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> never

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
mixed on and that is the under the never

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.690 
mixed on and that is the under the never
sky<00:03:44.760> trilogy<00:03:45.330> by<00:03:45.870> Veronica<00:03:45.900> Rossi<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.010> own<00:03:47.460> all

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
sky trilogy by Veronica Rossi I own all

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
sky trilogy by Veronica Rossi I own all
of<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.970> books<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.990> just<00:03:49.260> recently<00:03:49.470> bought

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
of the books and I just recently bought

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.970 
of the books and I just recently bought
the<00:03:50.160> last<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.450> probably<00:03:52.080> going<00:03:52.740> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
the last one so I'm probably going I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.170 
the last one so I'm probably going I
think<00:03:53.190> I'm<00:03:53.280> gonna<00:03:53.400> give<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.700> second<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.150> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
think I'm gonna give the second one a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.990 
think I'm gonna give the second one a
try<00:03:54.510> eventually<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.380> then<00:03:56.010> see<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.850> gets

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
try eventually and then see if it gets

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.610 
try eventually and then see if it gets
better<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.840> doesn't<00:03:58.170> I'm<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.350> gonna

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
better and if it doesn't I'm just gonna

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.620 
better and if it doesn't I'm just gonna
give<00:03:58.830> these<00:03:58.980> all<00:03:59.190> away<00:03:59.460> because<00:03:59.730> I<00:04:00.180> wasn't

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
give these all away because I wasn't

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.300 
give these all away because I wasn't
blown<00:04:00.900> away<00:04:01.170> by<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.410> book<00:04:01.740> I<00:04:01.920> actually

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
blown away by this book I actually

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.720 
blown away by this book I actually
didn't<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.210> like<00:04:03.570> it<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.870> much<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.590> just<00:04:05.400> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
didn't really like it that much I just I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.700 
didn't really like it that much I just I
think<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:06.720> cuz<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.960> thought<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.260> was<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.380> sci-fi

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
think it's cuz I thought it was a sci-fi

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.920 
think it's cuz I thought it was a sci-fi
I<00:04:08.340> thought<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.850> world-building<00:04:09.270> was<00:04:09.720> just

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
I thought the world-building was just

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.400 
I thought the world-building was just
very<00:04:10.170> poor<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.760> didn't<00:04:12.060> understand<00:04:12.750> what

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
very poor and I didn't understand what

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.670 
very poor and I didn't understand what
was<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.830> on<00:04:13.920> because<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.680> I'll

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
was going on because of that so I I'll

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860 
was going on because of that so I I'll
probably<00:04:17.010> read<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.520> second<00:04:17.850> one<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.600> I'm

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
probably read the second one but I'm

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.830 
probably read the second one but I'm
kind<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
kind of and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.320 
kind of and
so<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.470> believe<00:04:21.160> those<00:04:21.400> are<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.880> series

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
so I believe those are all the series

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.980 
so I believe those are all the series
that<00:04:22.810> I'm<00:04:23.230> not<00:04:23.590> planning<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:24.040> finishing<00:04:24.990> let

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990
