00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and how about friends I hope they are well and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 have humor to play because today they 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 I bring a new adventure map created 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.320
 for me I'll show them fast 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 flying this and my practical interest of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.740
 what is it because the video I do not want 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.640
 do it so long, if it's 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 on so they had the field and everything not 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.869
 but you find out that there is a one 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.750
 town as well as that abandoned there 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.080
 who he was abducted because he had mine 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 diamonds and this town and was locked 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.719
 and then you feel like rescuing him and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.149
 You even went out to look for students 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.670
 adventure and that and then if you have to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.270
 find a prison where they are free 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.720
 where are they and where are they locked 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.460
 and release this thread the right of 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.990
 be going after what the prison is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.030
 rare but as you can see here is the 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.790
 town is abandoned where there is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 do in here after there are there is a 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 Park 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 everything has its history there are some 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 some posters that were explaining that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.560
 you have to do your life and I do not think 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.979
 that are slow and that this is big 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.229
 the map that I did it like and I do not know 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 but this map does so much that what 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 I 'm not going to upload it because I could not find the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.770
 audio way delayed you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 they have to follow the gravel road 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.229
 always to be able to see what's in 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.350
 to do this map because for 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 follow the map route and do not leave here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 down in this hole there is a labyrinth a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 part of this lava that is here 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.750
 this is my job 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.509
 apart from this there is a labyrinth and then 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 tell how the exit is so that it does not 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.159
 is so difficult but that I do put you in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.679
 a colorful carpet chest and a peak 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.990
 so that he finds it easier just 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.200
 I did as I did and pretty much I 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200
 I learned 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.799
 that arrived and well yes 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.380
 is what gives more things the labyrinths 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.170
 of sheet to see if you do not know 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.900
 so desperate for the truth if 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.970
 this is a little bit big 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 and I think that they are waiting 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.260
 I attack because I've already lost 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.230
 but what 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.230
 if she 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.510
 it is over here you in you will be 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 in this labyrinth with a good peak 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.670
 several peaks and colorful carpet for 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.360
 that they can be guided and not get lost so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.470
 fast and have we go here is this the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.490
 trolleys that take you to the surface 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.490
 verb heat 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.940
 here is 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.340
 to be a little lengthening massages 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.750
 program the chairs and all right and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.460
 then some stairs here all 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.610
 girls so that battles when climbing 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.400
 and then you're going to get here to this prison 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.830
 from here it's an entrance that is not the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.470
 prison is exactly the option is 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.090
 down then as the entrance 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.099
 in the crater here style bricks or 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.080
 you throw up here a cup die 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.220
 because there is water below and nothing else 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.660
 soda 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.050
 although the piÃ±ata 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.760
 and this is where the departure here these 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
 distant signs discovered what this 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.930
 which he says he expects the mirrors to take in 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.260
 effect this is because there are spawn of 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.170
 enemies of Italian zombies as the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.620
 that put the villagers on their fence 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.450
 well for example here is one and so 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.730
 they will appear and you in each cell 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.290
 even if you do not have to go opening 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.750
 two by two because when they appear 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.820
 they will want to escape and if not then 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.480
 you want to have them already appear 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.730
 then wait here for a minute or two 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.430
 in here for this already when 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.680
 happen to be all the villagers in their 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.160
 prisons and all the enemies already and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.260
 falling down wanting to kill then it 's 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 good and this make maps coming out of 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.630
 here they only break the rubble of 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.420
 here without the zombies pickman 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.820
 kill already go out these stairs that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.700
 they take them to some credits but 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.660
 Well , I do not want to extend this much 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.080
 Jaime is that is in the audio so 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.910
 delayed and I hope you like this 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.620
 let us be carried away by the quality of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.330
 video you know what 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.580
 nothing more because the video is bad not 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 means that the map also so 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.930
 good and nothing more to say I have a 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.930
 map or tutorials and goodbye
