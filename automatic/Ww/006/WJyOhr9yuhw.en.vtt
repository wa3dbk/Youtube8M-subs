 I cry for you when you can 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.670
 she pop her because I'm losing my 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.600
 heart would like him we have material to wear 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.600
 the estac was there 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.160
 the individual itinerary for example 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.290
 the one from new to that means 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 independence means freedom 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.360
 and the faculty also to open up to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.699
 noises of the world when we listen to his 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.860
 songs his albums we do not feel 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.300
 someone who invests in the box 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.640
 his father if I can express myself as well 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.040
 but it is someone who is true in 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.990
 his father's box but opened all 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.790
 windows to hear the sound of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 world 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.680
 where does this great vertigo come from 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:32.200
 there was a moment there is this opportunity 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 after a heavy water leak 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:43.840
 it is again the joy of what I do 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.950
 anything I sled 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.390
 I slip I rest 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.189
 fan I do not wait in the subway anymore 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 will no longer go to melzer 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:02.790
 whatever the season would not be 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.120
 nicolas sense it's an album 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 who is not to love for we will pass 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.630
 germany to tomorrow saturday what am I 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.930
 make songs I make an album that 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.270
 rightly part of life this is the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.700
 quality I do my songs for myself 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.690
 romp to get better to defeat 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 the loneliness of being in Paris that a city 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.700
 there are so many people but still 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.120
 it's not you but I in that sense are 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.190
 not face down and it's a life that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830
 you aspire because you are obliged 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 to search inside you I you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.720
 have to tell you that this point of whatever 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.720
 I want to defend myself well 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.920
 but knowing like that 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 when 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.320
 that one is a characteristic that is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.450
 recurrent in this album is that 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.760
 I wanted to show in music 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 it is done alone but at the same time 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.260
 that's the finger of it and that I have 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 me is sweetness and she gave me 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.250
 his share under the rhythms with his song 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.590
 say I will not take you without my knowledge 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.170

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.370
 salt 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.290
 start the song is a story of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.150
 of happiness I will not bring back we will not do 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.220
