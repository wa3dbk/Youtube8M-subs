00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
be the physical expression of the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
be the physical expression of the
feeling<00:00:49.980> called<00:00:50.700> love<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.480> why<00:00:51.600> it's

feeling called love that's why it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.889 
feeling called love that's why it's
called<00:00:51.870> making<00:00:51.960> love<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.449> integral

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
called making love so it is an integral

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 
called making love so it is an integral
part<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.260> relationship<00:00:55.829> whether<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.699> choose

part of relationship whether you choose
to<00:00:58.430> or<00:00:59.430> not<00:01:00.030> basically<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.870> can't<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.320> can't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to or not basically you can't you can't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
to or not basically you can't you can't
ignore<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> fact<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.149> an<00:01:03.270> integral<00:01:03.660> part

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
ignore the fact that is an integral part

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
ignore the fact that is an integral part
if<00:01:04.140> actually<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> relationship<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
something you're actually is something

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
something you're actually is something
that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.979> expect<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> brain

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that you you expect like how the brain

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
that you you expect like how the brain
connects<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:11.010> walk<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.400> future<00:01:11.610> or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
connects gonna walk up in future or

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
connects gonna walk up in future or
something<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
something you need to like know if this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
something you need to like know if this
person<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.520> good<00:01:14.760> enough<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.330> anything

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
person is good enough for you anything

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
person is good enough for you anything
so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> make<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> second<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> future<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so you make the second a future like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
so you make the second a future like
cheating<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.509> husband<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> order<00:01:19.350> maybe

cheating on your husband and order maybe

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.830 
cheating on your husband and order maybe
because<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.310> good<00:01:20.520> definitely<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because it's not good definitely the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
because it's not good definitely the
spice<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> edge<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.189> know

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
spice is that edge you know

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.609 
spice is that edge you know
it<00:01:23.939> knows<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.600> boring<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.229> definitely

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it knows off you're boring so definitely

it knows off you're boring so definitely
I<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> keep<00:01:26.340> bringing<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
I you have to keep bringing it

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.790 
I you have to keep bringing it
oh<00:01:27.100> yeah<00:01:27.820> well<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.110> because<00:01:29.620> I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
oh yeah well I think it is because I

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.130 
oh yeah well I think it is because I
mean<00:01:29.980> if<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.820> don't<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.270> now<00:01:31.420> when<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:31.870> get
