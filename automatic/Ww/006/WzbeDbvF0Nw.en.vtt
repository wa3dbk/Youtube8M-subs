00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 what's up perryman is today wing haven and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.309
 we are here with a head 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 we are at dawn when 360 we are 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.160
 on the Chinese side the Americans 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 they come out exactly there in front so in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 straight line place because the most 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.520
 envelopes that I crossed with 14 and I did not 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
 We want to see a little work 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 specific here and next opening 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.250
 in a couple or more or less good more than a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 par three its lucky enough that there are more than 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.850
 three are going to go one behind the boxes 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.480
 that I've seen 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 there's a dead grenade behind there 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.440
 It's time to go down and I'm passionate going to the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 part of highway but been very blind 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.379
 Well at least it seemed to kill it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.820
 kill it from lying grenade please do not 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.510
 I know where it is and see if my partner 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.519
 give me a package 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.519
 I really do not know about the world is around here 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.920
 because here I have people so that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.200
 have people in the post this delay 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 even this must be delayed a little 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.080
 I'm not going to do it is to try and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 motorway when we go and we hope to go 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.399
 on the freeway part is so much 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.869
 does that part of there so instead 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.490
 to stop me you have to try to kill the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.990
 I'm going to do is try to go around a bit and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.810
 gain a little more angle before I have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.939
 located this too 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.550
 once we have the angle plus or 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.160
 least caught from here 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.360
 because it is much easier to kill and 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.640
 especially that they do not kill us 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.050
 us because that we stayed there 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 will catch with shooter has right angle 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.020
 towards us and the safest thing is that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 they envy us 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.159
 is dead just as the lizard is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.820
 that I had not seen her, we opened the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.110
 where they come out they are worth if they are in the part of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.310
 the highway exactly there 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.920
 I think they are there 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 I have 11 bullets I really prefer 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
 try to kill a close-to- catch 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.040
 subject before trying to kill one of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.410
 away and see me see my pipe to see what 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.650
 does these over here that I have 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.510
 God kills me with the wax that is a weapon 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.610
 that short-range then humiliates 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.370
 quite the base that has destroyed me 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 more than I expected the truth 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.970
 tried to ensure too much the edge to 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.490
 the best 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.440
 I thought it did not make more sense to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.420
 to kill him but he has not fired well 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 with the hare with the love that he has and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 other that distance because it is generally 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.200
 favorite among 360 with the guard and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.940
 straight line out there I saw that there was 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.740
 one at the bottom the safest thing is a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150
 sniper that other so what what 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.350
 I'm going to do quite a bit of winning 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.350
 angle to this thing that I was 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.099
 I tried to focus on what was 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.599
 in front of me I really threw him 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.910
 naturally I should not have gone for 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.519
 there because good there were enough people and 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.040
 others trying to make me a little bit 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.270
 glad the hero has not left me at all 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.380
 as 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.840
 as the truth here we have two to see 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.300
 what do we do with more brake over there I'm going to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.190
 try to clean the area a bit by the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.250
 that they have killed me before but I would swear 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.819
 that is quite clean yet it is not 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 the rest 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.849
 and make sure that nobody in the area 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 before 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.300
 we have one behind us that 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.250
 kill him 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.060
 and matter do not worry 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.090
 clear also to 100 a danger that 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.650
 kill us nobody or at least that does not appear 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.050
 this think that is under the bridge 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.849
 pressure and very worried but I was by 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.450
 here I do not know why I had not seen it 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.129
 before 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.950
 it's not that for the right we have 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.640
 enough people and so that also 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.640
 You can kill it 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.239
 is pretty fucking irradiated to the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.480
 so, so, let 's launch here 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.280
 back here 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.280
 then a bit the area and we will launch 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.100
 we will do it in making noise so that 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.070
 people do not know we're coming here 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.780
 some impact we will be a little less 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.030
 two men one of them gaining angle 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.660
 to the two zones these assimilate time 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.290
 shoot any of them 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.670
 because it's not that visibility is not 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.610
 let your door be the truth so that 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.719
 I have 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.569
 there is another teacher masks what 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:35.569
 next to charge to pass 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.509
 and I will wait 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.110
 besides people are dead hello hello now 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.870
 you die to appropriate a kit and see what 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.280
 you bring to your person the cradle is day 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.740
 in this situation it is true that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.260
 thank you enough to sell go around 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.419
 completely while these are stuck or 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.060
 let them stick they try that with 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.050
 a bit of luck there is nobody around 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.470
 to appear since my team has 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.950
 cleaned 11 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.600
 but to the employee by 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.639
 by themselves they wanted to give a little 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.379
 back to see 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.270
 if my team did not do it because I already 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.849
 neglected the faults to the enemy this 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.110
 that is pretty breaked out there 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.620
 we would be back we continue by 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.620
 freeway 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.920
 we go down and those who have here 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.540
 my mother go gift in which we are 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.060
 In Christmas 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.200
 and these people if I give clear if I give 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.270
 over here there is one seems to give us 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.080
 realize that unless here is a 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.920
 gadget 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.230
 well done 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.810
 let's swim angle over here that I have 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.810
 here below where they are here 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.890
 if you only kill 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.290
 rancher but do not worry about that 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.129
 fail 20 and has been very optimistic of me 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.569
 non-extremist party 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.909
 have you seen this this is called 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.460
 that is to say the mutual favor but good to 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.700
 final I have killed death does not count 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.550
 because it's just the easiest what 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.830
 does not count death good the truth that 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.180
 has been a map is not for speed that 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.590
 we have pulled out pretty fast we have 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.910
 Quite a lot of what we wanted 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.650
 Do more truth than good 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.080
 my part nothing more to add I hope that 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.910
 you liked the gameplay any 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.340
 question you already know that the comments and 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.830
 I'm happy to answer them so why 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.470
 my part nothing more to add and see you 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.470
 people in another session until then bye
