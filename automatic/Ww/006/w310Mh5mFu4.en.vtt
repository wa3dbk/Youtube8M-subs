00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very well to everyone gathered to your techno at 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.620
 day we go with the review of kubot x 10 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.620
 inside video 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.199
 well let's press this review as 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.699
 always by the physical section we go 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.320
 first to the right side where 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.060
 we found the volume buttons and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.120
 power at the top we find 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 the tab to see the 3.5 port 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.780
 minijack let's continue on the left 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.969
 and we mount another tab where we can 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.600
 host two sim cards and the card 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.409
 microsd if we go to the bottom 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.539
 we found the usb port and the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.030
 microphone from the front 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.039
 top we can find the camera the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 front camera the speaker and sensors 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.719
 of proximity and also although you can not see 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 is we have the led indicator with the part 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.409
 lower we find the touchpad 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 of menu that entertains me for nothing the 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.589
 screen which is a success if we go 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.690
 to the back we find the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.609
 speaker in the lower left and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.800
 the camera in the upper left 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 also next to the flash 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.680
 if we see the materials we find 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.630
 both the same for the screen 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 front as the back of the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.770
 device and the aluminum frame of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 aviation is a pretty good aluminum and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.550
 it looks pretty tough too 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 talking about resistance we have a 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.070
 water resistant device so 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.510
 so much if you want some kind of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.370
 splash or drop that falls on the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.350
 device you do not have problems with this 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.120
 cube of miss death and on this device 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.740
 we found a unibody body by 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.840
 that the micro sd tabs on the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.120
 side and we can not remove the lid 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.980
 back we find ourselves in this 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.430
 a display device 55 inches 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.670
 with an ips panel and a resolution of 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.010
 1280 x 720 pixels with a camera 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.900
 front of 8 megapixels the truth is 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.190
 that the interior photos the selphy 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.780
 they usually work out pretty well 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.340
 general when we have a condition of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.410
 light and on the back we find 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.570
 a very good 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.159
 with flash and autofocus 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.370
 and going to the operating system 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.780
 we found android 4.4 point 2 this 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.180
 operative that works very well this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 terminal that also comes rooted comes 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.170
 with superuser something very positive for 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.880
 many users and that also comes with 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.009
 a very nice customization layer 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.870
 a little goodbye style that will also give 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.030
 the delights of many who are already have 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.580
 used to the typical android and that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.870
 come in a bit that theme and as not 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.550
 could be less in the kubot brand 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.170
 we have a device with dual sim 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.270
 to always have coverage in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 all the places we find also 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.320
 a 2400 milliamp battery that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.390
 the time to be in waiting time 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.180
 works really well to me has it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.270
 come to last up to 23 days minimum with 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
 a little use of the device if we go to 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.640
 the power of the device we find 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.470
 a processor mts in 1592 m chooses core to 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.570
 one with 4 gigahertz 8 cores for 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 this kubot x 10 that also comes with 2GB 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.280
 of ram memory and 16 gb of storage 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.320
 on disk the truth is that it is a delight 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.480
 play games on this kubot device 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.610
 x 10 and that you also have no problems 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.260
 when browsing or find pages 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.720
 web with a lot of multimedia content 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.340
 pretty fast and fluid 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.170
 In short, we are facing a 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.570
 device that all its aspects is 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.460
 quite versatile and very good in almost 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.200
 all its facets the camera worked 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.240
 well especially the rear camera the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.430
 screen looks really good we have 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.620
 a large 55-inch screen and that 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.450
 the device does not stop being precious 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.370
 in all its aspects with a design 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.630
 exclusive pretty good and so 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.340
 Overall, I liked this one a lot 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.140
 kubot x dÃ­az works very well without 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.430
 problems for day to day 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.840
 and anybody that like the device I 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.630
 I think that it is satisfied that we are 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.300

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.530
