00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.150
today we made chocolate cream shots pudding recipe
here's how we did it this recipe

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.530
contains chocolate gelatin sugar vanilla
pod and whipping cream start by heating

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:29.490
your cream you don't want to boil it you
just want to scald it as the cream heats

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.140
add your vanilla just before it's about
to boil remove it from the heat remove

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:50.940
the vanilla pods add your gelatin and
your sugar give it a whisk now just let

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.420
that cool a bit while we prep the
chocolate now that the cream is cooled a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.960
bit we're going to add about a third of
it to our chocolate to begin the melting

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.760
process let it sit for 30 seconds or
more and then give it a bit of a stir

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.409
once your chocolate is melted and it's
lump free add the rest of the cream and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:27.990
whisk it again once it's whisked
together we're going to put it in the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.920
fridge for an hour hour and a half to
let it cool down and set

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.189
this is so rich you really don't need
very much so I like to serve them in the

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.030
shot glasses just kind of fun to to get
the chocolate cream into the shot glass

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.409
I like to use a piping bag

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.690
