00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.310
 old age protection organism 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.649
 so weak that disease 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.049
 harmless youths represent 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:19.529
 deadly danger that is all ours 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:25.490
 cells are born well in the process you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:31.849
 wanted discharge goes through a life cycle 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.849
 grow old and then die 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.730
 cell life cycle is a definite 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.280
 number of divisions 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.129
 and the formation of new cells to replace old 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 doubling is the key mechanism of any 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.829
 cell division as a result of you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.289
 should get two perfectly 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.149
 identical cells whose nucleus structure 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.410
 present 2 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.660
 absolutely identical dna 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.620
 immune cells are updated 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.410
 somewhat different 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.220
 and a key role in their birth is played 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.510
 macrophages 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.310
 macrophages 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.470
 kind of white blood cells they are with 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.530
 births monitor our purity 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 organism at the cellular level principles 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.390
 their work can be compared to how 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.850
 working insects mustache groping even 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.550
 microscopic threat of macrophages 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.090
 destroy it and the dead enemy 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:44.149
 cells and their remnants are eaten conclude 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:46.670
 inside their shell macrophages are learning 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.890
 recognize enemies gradually with 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.259
 most viruses and microbes we 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 face the first years of life for 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.170
 sweeper cells is a learning moment 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.509
 later when encountering familiar ones 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.610
 alien objects macrophages 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.100
 destroys them much faster and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.410
 more effective therefore the disease is not 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.390
 transferred in childhood represent 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.580
 serious danger for an adult 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.060
 human 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.930
 capturing the products of cell degradation he 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.709
 from the environment captures and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.840
 specific protein 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.120
 macrophage throws it into the surrounding 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.690
 environment from this environment alive still 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.360
 viable cells 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.970
 they capture him and he launches them 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.560
 cell division processes 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.200
 macrophages introduce other cells 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.549
 immunity with the new enemy and helps 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.110
 recognize his future 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.200
 destroying the enemy macrophage cell 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.939
 simultaneously highlights the protein fact 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.130
 substance signal triggering 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.920
 reproduction of immune cells 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.480
 so macrophages support our defensive 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.510
 the system 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.390
 eliminate debris and force it and 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.670
 to cultivate 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.580
 but macrophages themselves are not capable 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.569
 update forever the older person 7 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.569
 less of them becomes
