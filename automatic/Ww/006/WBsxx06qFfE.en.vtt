00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.790
 lazy and not rich in major releases 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.550
 July gives us a great chance 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.779
 relax and take your time 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 turn one's eyes to the side 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 cute indie games without them 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 by 3 Polish distribution creators 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 duties between which 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.890
 fit into a fairly standard 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.129
 the scheme when one draws another writes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 music and the third do the rest on 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.550
 the steam store shelf has recently been 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 set up 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.379
 game ronin about her and I will not talk 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 too long to delay the inevitable 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.500
 and immediately note the fact of which probably 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 thought many aware seeing 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 local gameplay 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 yes all this is very similar to gun point 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 notable independent game about noir 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.439
 a raincoat jumper seems like so much that on 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 first glance ronin may seem 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:18.330
 modifications of a successful two-dimensional stealth 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.390
 released in 2013 but not on this analogy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.939
 and parallels with other artistic 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.729
 creations do not end with the plot 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.710
 of setting the game is full of references to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.500
 Tarantino all the way to kill Bill 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 we are represented by the main character in a motorcycle 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 helmet 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.450
 famously wielding samurai sword course 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 missions 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 which is nothing but 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.360
 as a series of blood sensations so 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.450
 the mood here is quite harsh humor 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
 Gu has no place but in krovischi 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.690
 excess 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.530
 it pours mainly during the course 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.710
 specific turn-based battles that 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.730
 inevitable 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.830
 despite having turned out to be a stealth base 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.350
 Battle proceed as follows enemies 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.440
 frantically trying to shoot the hero out 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 pistols or machine guns and we have to 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.940
 first avoid intersection with 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.180
 the trajectories of their shots famously leaping along 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.920
 walls and ceilings and secondly 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.790
 neutralize everyone 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.640
 detractors catching them on 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 recharge or by applying special 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.290
 skills that can be acquired during 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.780
 passing by pumping between 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.060
 missions it comes to things such as 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.510
 sweeping sword use 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.270
 distracting holographic double 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.980
 teleportation and everything else 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.709
 and the skills cannot be applied simply 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.310
 so you must first fill in the special 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.760
 scale to the required level using 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.230
 successful attacks and killings in the case of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.110
 overflow scale immediately 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.650
 will become empty but at the same time will give the main 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.430
 the hero 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.900
 opportunity to make an extra move 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.560
 This chip is called limit break 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.739
 in general, the combat system is enough 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.100
 original but not without controversial nuances 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.840
 example player sometimes has to avoid 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.810
 attack on enemies so you don't accidentally 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.209
 overfill the notorious scale as 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.299
 sometimes the ability to apply any 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.940
 skill is much more important than perspective 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.520
 make one extra move 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.490
 strange yet during step-by-step 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.480
 confrontations we move 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.120
 exclusively jumping 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.780
 there is no possibility just to make a few 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.880
 steps 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.790
 just pull up hanging on 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.830
 some ledge is imperative 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.820
 jumping is not that strong 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.280
 annoying but still strange how is that 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.090
 samurai can't neutralize a person 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.670
 not killing his thing is that on levels 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.760
 peaceful civilians are often encountered 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.100
 able to raise the alarm, and the only 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.630
 option to prevent this from escaping when 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.650
 this unjustified sacrifice 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.930
 do not come across them like 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.880
 the script is very desirable because for 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.520
 get useful points 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.190
 skills after completing the mission you need 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.960
 perform three additional points 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.990
 kill all enemies 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.400
 avoid civilian and non-civilian casualties 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.560
 raise the alarm 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.570
 worth noting that the alarm 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.070
 does not turn on immediately after 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.790
 ronnie we were spotted 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.110
 the player has the ability to eliminate everyone 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.640
 compromised room and go out 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.580
 out of the water as I said step by step 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.820
 battles inevitable but real-time scarlet 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.730
 Stealth also plays a major role by using 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.160
 covert shadow action and neat 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.650
 silent preparatory activities 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 you can greatly simplify your life 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.400
 when it comes to open 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.710
 confrontation 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.380
 In this regard, the game probably keeps very 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.320
 right balance with so say 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.169
 not much bothering that is 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.030
 you can vary the style of passing legs 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.180
 close enough framework 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.830
 thus, the way is expressed inherent 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.449
 ronin is a pleasant combination of brevity and 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.449
 there is nothing detailed 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.520
 superfluous three main types of enemies dozen 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.740
 skills to learn each of which 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.320
 ascetic value 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.570
 plot blotches served very 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.330
 compressed text messaging 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.910
 yes perhaps there is no room for 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.910
 tactical maneuvers that was present in 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.750
 gun point but the game is still not just me 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.970
 able to provide difficulties opposite 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.380
 advantages to the list which is necessary 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.080
 add high-quality sound 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.050
 accompanying nice graphics and 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.220
 good style is essentially everything 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.919
 one definite minus periodical 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.050
 glitches while I went through the company a few 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.780
 once faced with a problem when 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.960
 the main character flew through the walls and 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.080
 turned out to be where he was obviously not supposed to 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.070
 be that led to stains restarting 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.030
 levels in general for ronin it may not 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.250
 ingenious but very pleasant and 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.380
 exciting entertainment recommended 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:21.199
 all game lovers who have to 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.199
 how to think and act
