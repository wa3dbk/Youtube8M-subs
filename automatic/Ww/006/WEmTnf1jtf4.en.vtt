rugby<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.129> suppose<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.730> doing<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> same

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
rugby and I suppose by doing the same

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.580 
rugby and I suppose by doing the same
test<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> regional<00:00:57.899> players<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
test as the regional players you can

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
test as the regional players you can
gauge<00:00:58.739> yourself<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.550> far<00:00:59.789> away<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
gauge yourself and see how far away you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
gauge yourself and see how far away you
are<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> improve<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
are and what you need to improve on the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.149 
are and what you need to improve on the
perhaps<00:01:02.190> step<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> next<00:01:03.390> level

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
perhaps step up to that next level

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.140 
perhaps step up to that next level
especially<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> younger<00:01:05.519> players<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
especially for the younger players I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
especially for the younger players I
think<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.869> massive<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.680> they

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
think it's massive for them because they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.990 
think it's massive for them because they
are<00:01:07.950> obviously<00:01:08.040> that's<00:01:08.729> why<00:01:08.880> their

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
are obviously that's why their

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
are obviously that's why their
aspirations<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.439> invaluable

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
aspirations are I think it's invaluable

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070

it raises the profile and the level of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.800 
to see what the strengths and weaknesses
we<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.740> build<00:01:41.890> upon<00:01:45.630> yeah<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.689> think

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
we can you can build upon yeah I think

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.529 
we can you can build upon yeah I think
going<00:01:47.110> forward<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.530> vitally<00:01:47.890> important

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
going forward is vitally important

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.520 
going forward is vitally important

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
firstly it gives you as an individual a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.109 
firstly it gives you as an individual a
good<00:01:50.679> indicator<00:01:51.070> where<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.490> are<00:01:51.640> as<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> player
