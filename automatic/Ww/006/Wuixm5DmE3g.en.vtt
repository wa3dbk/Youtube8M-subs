00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
easy I find the easiest way to do that

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.119 
easy I find the easiest way to do that
is<00:03:55.599> if<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.079> have<00:03:56.379> an<00:03:56.709> eyeliner<00:03:57.870> marker<00:03:59.129> so

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
is if you have an eyeliner marker so

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.369 
is if you have an eyeliner marker so

this is a NYX one and you can see it's

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.099 
this is a NYX one and you can see it's
just<00:04:02.530> like<00:04:02.919> a<00:04:03.099> felt<00:04:03.340> tip<00:04:03.579> pen<00:04:03.879> it's<00:04:04.659> super

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.629 
just like a felt tip pen it's super
simple<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.620> use<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:05.949> you<00:04:06.069> use<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.489> same

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
simple to use and you use it the same

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.729 
simple to use and you use it the same
way<00:04:06.819> you<00:04:06.849> would<00:04:07.060> like<00:04:07.480> right<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.379> do<00:04:08.560> this

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
way you would like right to do this

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.629 
way you would like right to do this
basically<00:04:09.459> all<00:04:09.639> you're<00:04:09.819> going<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.120> do<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
basically all you're going to do is

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.969 
basically all you're going to do is
start<00:04:12.639> drawing<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:13.209> little<00:04:13.750> C's<00:04:14.409> back<00:04:14.769> and

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
start drawing just little C's back and

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:25.770 
start drawing just little C's back and
forth<00:04:15.099> like<00:04:15.220> parenthesis

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.990 

and<00:04:26.320> little<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.770> know<00:04:26.890> random<00:04:27.340> dots<00:04:27.610> works

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
and little you know random dots works

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.290 
and little you know random dots works
too<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.930> really<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.650> key<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.370> as<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:34.030> can

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
too but really the key to it as you can

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.020 
too but really the key to it as you can
see<00:04:34.360> over<00:04:34.660> here<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.710> very<00:04:36.040> random<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
see over here is to be very random to

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.850 
see over here is to be very random to
not<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.450> precise<00:04:37.870> about<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.380> because<00:04:38.650> if<00:04:38.770> you

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
not be precise about it because if you

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.770 
not be precise about it because if you
look<00:04:39.040> at<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.190> leopard<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:40.150> not<00:04:40.300> precise<00:04:40.600> at

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
look at a leopard it's not precise at

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.710

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
all and just keep doing that until you

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.870 
all and just keep doing that until you
get<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.440> style<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.920> shape<00:04:48.310> add<00:04:48.640> the
