00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.440 
and I ate a piece of gum and the flavor
actually<00:03:07.970> lasted<00:03:08.720> quite<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.200> while<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:11.180> lasts

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
actually lasted quite a while it lasts

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.080 
actually lasted quite a while it lasts
for<00:03:11.840> about<00:03:11.930> 30<00:03:12.880> minutes<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:15.760> about<00:03:16.760> 2

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
for about 30 minutes I think and about 2

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.809 
for about 30 minutes I think and about 2
was<00:03:17.359> only<00:03:17.600> half<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.959> piece<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.709> then<00:03:22.489> later

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
was only half a piece and so then later

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.640 
was only half a piece and so then later
on<00:03:23.060> during<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.810> day<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:25.959> got<00:03:26.959> another<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:27.410> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
on during the day I got another one a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.099 
on during the day I got another one a
full<00:03:27.889> stick<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.310> gum<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.670> time<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.900> that

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
full stick of gum this time and that

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.339 
full stick of gum this time and that
lasted<00:03:30.440> quite<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:31.010> while<00:03:31.280> too

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
lasted quite a while too

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.479 
lasted quite a while too
the<00:03:33.349> only<00:03:33.470> reason<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:33.889> threw<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.280> out<00:03:34.340> was

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the only reason I threw it out was

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.250 
the only reason I threw it out was
because<00:03:34.639> my<00:03:34.819> jaw<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.060> starting<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.540> hurt<00:03:35.720> I'm

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
because my jaw is starting to hurt I'm

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.580 
because my jaw is starting to hurt I'm
chewing<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.739> too<00:03:36.980> much<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:41.169> from<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
chewing it too much so I'm from on a

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.509 
chewing it too much so I'm from on a
scale<00:03:42.919> of<00:03:42.980> 5<00:03:43.310> stars<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:45.650> star<00:03:45.919> being<00:03:46.400> the
