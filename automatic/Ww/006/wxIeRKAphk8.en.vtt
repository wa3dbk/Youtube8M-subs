 vela before mona in union forgiveness then 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.110
 created under this navas duarte the match played 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 in the first moments that if a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.240
 big counter attack mine that makes the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.070
 pass for carlito and that's the goal 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.070
 disgusting ito if the goal of mexico 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.019
 that they are going so we start well the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 match with a goal in the 3rd minute 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.840
 the game I played in the first 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.129
 in the first few minutes watch this 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.920
 against attack once again big 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.760
 passes from backpacks emilienne who 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.129
 accelerates on the side 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.840
 it has more than engage a large 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.840
 strike and then snap 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.230
 and that's how it happens 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.819
 2 0 from the 5th minute under the 10 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.099
 the match played in the first moments 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.569
 and just after the kickoff 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.519
 we will put pressure on him 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.690
 tried to intercept and unfortunately 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.540
 it will not be the case since it is 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.019
 podolski that will reduce the mark 2-1 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.200
 there are three goals in six minutes the match 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.950
 share on the basis of big patients 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.299
 unfortunately there will be nothing else 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.720
 will happen in this first 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.950
 period 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.239
 I will have some opportunities but without 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.069
 more so 2 1 at the half time and there it is 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.889
 on an error on his part that I succeed 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.260
 to seal the match look at the sectors 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.340
 vital who took advantage of his bad 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.670
 touch and this path him to the 60th minute 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.620
 3-1 will be the final score 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.109
