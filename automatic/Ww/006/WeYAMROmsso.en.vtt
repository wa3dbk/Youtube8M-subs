00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.460
 to make a real call like them 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.900
 that in the fabric 3d the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 do you need natural materials 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 such as send stone for veltens 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 and peer the goose around these things 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.119
 had to get a lot in the past 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 perform work 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.010
 the trees cut wood cut your voice 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.779
 edit and hunt but if you do then 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.090
 once is also very further 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.429
 proud of it is worth a lot in this 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.689
 delivery can do green let's see 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.689
 how you can make a real language 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.390
 this is the arrow as it should be 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.280
 first of all I am going to get up here 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.769
 cleans and then wrap around with old ones 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.620
 and then I will set up the points with 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.839
 working atmosphere I glue the bottom of the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.760
 spring on the shaft so that you can with the 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.339
 you're stuck here then if all three 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.969
 stuck then I can continue with language 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.969
 mega wrap 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.739
 and then the third 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.340
 ok that called a we are cleaned up 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.110
 and now i'm going to change my language to yellow 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.790
 develop so that it is a bit firmer 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.790
 one I start at the bottom 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.330
 so we go through the feathers until 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 I at the back and one then I do 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780
 actually the same again 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.330
 I now have the thread through the springs 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.940
 wound at more or less the same distance 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.820
 above name I am completely tight again 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.110
 bring color so that these ends too 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.110
 completely under the language 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.110
 here is a sort of button 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.160
 if you put this end all the way down 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.160
 then he is stuck 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.180
 as soon 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.190
 the next step is the point here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.440
 at the bottom that also puts my limits 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.440
 and we go and fitch does 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.270
 This is the well body the set up with 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.060
 using working tar 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 that is this pile this melts very quickly 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.120
 here is the band that we will go like this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.220
 Setting up 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.990
 must push even then he wears 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.760
 on and then you are there 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.760
 the arrow is finished I'm going to test now 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.290
 you fell heavy 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.450
 the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.450
 just
