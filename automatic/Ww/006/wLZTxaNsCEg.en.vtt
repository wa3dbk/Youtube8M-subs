patterns in FL Studio there's more than

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.270 
patterns in FL Studio there's more than
one<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.750> turn<00:00:13.200> notes<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.889> off<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
one way to turn notes on and off in the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
one way to turn notes on and off in the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
step sequencer in FL Studio one way of

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
step sequencer in FL Studio one way of
course<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.400> click<00:00:17.760> sequence<00:00:18.630> step<00:00:18.869> buttons

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
course is to click sequence step buttons

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040 
course is to click sequence step buttons
and<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.609> track<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.910> turns<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> notes

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and the track and that turns the notes

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
and the track and that turns the notes
on<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> off<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> can't<00:00:23.130> specify<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
on and off but you can't specify the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.689 
on and off but you can't specify the
pitch<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.769> that's<00:00:25.769> great<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.250> programming

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
pitch so that's great for programming

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.970 
pitch so that's great for programming
drums<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.990> melodic

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
drums but if you want to do melodic

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
drums but if you want to do melodic
phrase<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.699> not<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.240> work<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
phrase it's not going to work so the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
phrase it's not going to work so the
keyboard<00:00:31.619> editor<00:00:31.920> allows<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> add<00:00:32.579> pitch

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to the notes in the step sequencer it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
to the notes in the step sequencer it
also<00:00:35.520> allows<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.239> add<00:00:36.390> slide<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
also allows you to add slide and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
also allows you to add slide and
portamento<00:00:37.620> effects<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
portamento effects and I'm going to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.160 
portamento effects and I'm going to
explain<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.510> further<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
explain that a little further in the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130 
explain that a little further in the
tutorial<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:42.360> allows<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> quickly

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
tutorial and it allows you to quickly

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
tutorial and it allows you to quickly
drag<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> whole<00:00:43.950> group<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> notes<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> down

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
drag a whole group of notes up and down
the<00:00:45.329> keyboard<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> illustrate<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.899> let's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the keyboard so to illustrate this let's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.600 
the keyboard so to illustrate this let's
add<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:51.690> channel<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.680> existing<00:00:52.949> project

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
add a channel to our existing project

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
add a channel to our existing project
and<00:00:53.820> i'm<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> add<00:00:54.719> wasp<00:00:55.079> xt<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.770> we're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and i'm going to add wasp xt and we're

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.770 
and i'm going to add wasp xt and we're
going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.399> instrument<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.480> create<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
going to use this instrument to create a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.439 
going to use this instrument to create a
baseline<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> first<00:00:59.760> i<00:00:59.879> need<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.090> select<00:01:00.359> the

baseline so first i need to select the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
baseline so first i need to select the
channel<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:01.829> i'm<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> turn<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
channel then i'm going to turn the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.549 
channel then i'm going to turn the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
where you want the note to appear I'm

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.980 
where you want the note to appear I'm
going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> create<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> simple<00:01:25.409> eighth<00:01:26.130> note

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
going to create a simple eighth note

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.830 
going to create a simple eighth note
pattern

and if I clear this note by
right-clicking<00:02:03.340> you'll<00:02:03.579> see<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:03.880> it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
right-clicking you'll see that it

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.120 
right-clicking you'll see that it
becomes<00:02:04.329> inactive<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:05.439> these<00:02:05.560> two<00:02:05.770> interfaces

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
becomes inactive so these two interfaces

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.740 
becomes inactive so these two interfaces
for<00:02:06.369> turning<00:02:06.790> notes<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.360> off<00:02:07.450> work

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
for turning notes on and off work

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050 
for turning notes on and off work
together<00:02:08.020> let's<00:02:08.979> get<00:02:09.130> back<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.429> recording<00:02:09.940> our

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
together let's get back to recording our

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.830 
together let's get back to recording our
baseline<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:12.819> going<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.150> take<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.420> second

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
baseline I'm going to take the second

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.040 
baseline I'm going to take the second
note<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.910> play<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.030> an<00:02:16.120> octave<00:02:16.330> up<00:02:16.690> from<00:02:16.900> where

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
note and play it an octave up from where

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.559 
note and play it an octave up from where
it<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.849> simple<00:02:22.060> baseline

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
it is and now we have a simple baseline

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.530 
it is and now we have a simple baseline
but<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> wrong<00:02:23.800> octave<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
but it's in the wrong octave so what I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
but it's in the wrong octave so what I
want<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.140> take<00:02:26.349> this<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:26.860> these<00:02:27.220> notes

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
want to do is take this all these notes

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.160 
want to do is take this all these notes
at<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.670> same<00:02:27.760> time<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.360> drag<00:02:28.540> them<00:02:28.690> down<00:02:28.750> two

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
at the same time and drag them down two

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.259 
at the same time and drag them down two
octaves<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.280> get<00:02:30.430> more<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> pitch

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
octaves so I can get more in the pitch

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.680 
octaves so I can get more in the pitch
range<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.780> baseline<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.000> hold

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
range of a baseline so to do this hold

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.330

something that's much more like a

too discreet notes you're going to hear

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.270 
too discreet notes you're going to hear

to illustrate this I'm going to go on

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.680 
to illustrate this I'm going to go on
another<00:03:21.459> octave<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.450> note<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.690> then

another octave up for this note and then
I'm<00:03:25.810> going<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:25.959> turn<00:03:26.170> on<00:03:26.350> portamento<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.819> now

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
I'm going to turn on portamento and now

you hear it slide I'm going to slow the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.710 
you hear it slide I'm going to slow the
tempo<00:03:33.430> down<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> little<00:03:33.910> bit<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.390> can<00:03:34.450> hear

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
tempo down a little bit so you can hear

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.670 
tempo down a little bit so you can hear
it<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.959> little<00:03:35.200> more<00:03:35.410> dramatically<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:38.560> at

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
it a little more dramatically here at

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.759 
it a little more dramatically here at
slide<00:03:38.980> now<00:03:39.250> I'm<00:03:39.370> going<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.579> turn<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.819> off<00:03:40.769> now

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
slide now I'm going to turn it off now

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.559 
slide now I'm going to turn it off now
the<00:03:41.829> note<00:03:42.069> just<00:03:42.220> comes<00:03:42.459> on<00:03:42.639> so<00:03:43.450> that's

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
the note just comes on so that's

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.599 
the note just comes on so that's
portamento<00:03:45.870> let's<00:03:46.870> go<00:03:46.989> back<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.200> our<00:03:47.609> original

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
portamento let's go back to our original

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.650 
portamento let's go back to our original
tempo<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:50.850> we'll<00:03:51.850> put<00:03:52.030> our<00:03:52.120> note<00:03:52.269> back<00:03:52.420> down

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
tempo and we'll put our note back down

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.190 
tempo and we'll put our note back down
here

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.690 

okay<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.260> let's<00:03:58.530> add<00:03:58.680> some<00:03:58.710> rhythm<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.580> this

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
okay so let's add some rhythm to this

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.970 
okay so let's add some rhythm to this
track<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.390> I'm<00:04:00.990> going<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.290> use<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.590> sequence

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
track and I'm going to use the sequence

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.130 
track and I'm going to use the sequence
step<00:04:02.190> buttons<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:02.610> do<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.880> I'm<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.660> to

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
step buttons to do this I'm going to

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.860 
step buttons to do this I'm going to
create<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:04.770> kick<00:04:04.980> drum<00:04:05.010> pattern<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.820> hit<00:04:06.720> play

I get real time feedback on the notes
that<00:04:47.730> I'm<00:04:47.850> turning<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.919> let's<00:04:50.100> check<00:04:50.340> out

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
that I'm turning on so let's check out

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.030 
that I'm turning on so let's check out
this<00:04:50.669> pattern<00:04:51.030> now<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:55.560> sounds<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.860> lot<00:04:55.980> more

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
this pattern now it sounds a lot more

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.670 
this pattern now it sounds a lot more
interesting<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.169> it's<00:04:58.169> something<00:04:58.530> that's

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
interesting and it's something that's

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320 
interesting and it's something that's
really<00:04:58.860> cool<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.340> mess<00:04:59.729> around<00:04:59.760> with<00:05:00.300> a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
really cool to just mess around with a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.969 
really cool to just mess around with a
let<00:05:00.660> me<00:05:00.750> draw<00:05:00.960> some<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:04.530> course<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.860> can

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
let me draw some and of course you can

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.969 
let me draw some and of course you can
right-click<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.610> turn<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.790> few<00:05:06.000> notes<00:05:06.210> off

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
by sequencing with just the sequence

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.270 
by sequencing with just the sequence
