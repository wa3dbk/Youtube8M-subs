00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
more you hear and the more you see it

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.169 
more you hear and the more you see it
more<00:01:30.470> closely<00:01:30.679> you<00:01:31.069> can<00:01:31.399> listen<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:31.880> and

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179

view<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.810> you'll<00:01:33.590> find<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.890> there's<00:01:34.130> these

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
view it you'll find that there's these

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.240 
view it you'll find that there's these
very<00:01:35.060> kind<00:01:35.539> of<00:01:35.600> dark<00:01:35.810> undertones<00:01:36.439> within

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
very kind of dark undertones within

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.309 
very kind of dark undertones within
music<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.060> choreography<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.929> that's

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
music and the choreography and that's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.389 
music and the choreography and that's
where<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.890> guess<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.349> original<00:01:42.399> inspiration

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
where I guess the original inspiration

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.999 
where I guess the original inspiration
is<00:01:43.849> shown<00:01:44.360> kind<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.840> coming<00:01:45.140> through<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.679> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
is shown kind of coming through in the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.230 
is shown kind of coming through in the
work<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> it's<00:01:48.349> it's<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.429> tangible<00:01:49.819> starting

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
work so it's it's a tangible starting

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.580 
work so it's it's a tangible starting
place<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:50.899> like<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.110> literal

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
place but it's not like a literal

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.510 
place but it's not like a literal
there's<00:01:51.799> not<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.189> story<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.209> more<00:01:54.520> various

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
there's not a story it's more various

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.260 
there's not a story it's more various
kind<00:01:55.849> of<00:01:55.939> like<00:01:56.149> themes<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.689> motifs<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:59.179> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
lot of it is very much based in the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.089 
lot of it is very much based in the
