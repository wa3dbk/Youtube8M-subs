00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.740 

I've<00:00:19.530> run<00:00:19.860> quite<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> few<00:00:21.000> different<00:00:21.390> machines

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I've run quite a few different machines

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.700 
I've run quite a few different machines
and<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.710> believe<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:25.260> can't<00:00:25.500> beat

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and I believe that it is you can't beat

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.929 
and I believe that it is you can't beat
him<00:00:25.800> Adil<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> horsepower<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.349> speed<00:00:28.939> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
him Adil for the horsepower the speed it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060 
him Adil for the horsepower the speed it
just<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.599> works<00:00:30.930> together<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.590> well

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
just all works together really well

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
just all works together really well
the<00:00:32.369> biggest<00:00:32.580> thing<00:00:32.879> between<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.390> Medill<00:00:33.720> and

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the biggest thing between the Medill and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
the biggest thing between the Medill and
other<00:00:34.110> machines<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.800> run<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.940> swing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
other machines I've run is the swing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.770 
other machines I've run is the swing
power<00:00:36.720> is<00:00:37.309> unreal<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.760> module<00:00:39.059> handles<00:00:39.570> big

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
power is unreal the module handles big

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.570 
power is unreal the module handles big
logs<00:00:40.050> better<00:00:40.440> than<00:00:40.620> any<00:00:40.739> machine<00:00:41.160> I've<00:00:41.400> ever

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
logs better than any machine I've ever

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.740 
logs better than any machine I've ever
run<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> work<00:00:44.580> out<00:00:44.820> away<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.570> me

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
run and I like to work out away from me

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.070 
run and I like to work out away from me
a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.949> booms<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.699> speed<00:00:48.210> out

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
run for votes an hour through it I have

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.699 
run for votes an hour through it I have
been<00:01:59.280> running<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.729> machine<00:02:00.330> for<00:02:00.690> 500<00:02:01.349> hours

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
been running this machine for 500 hours

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.210 
been running this machine for 500 hours
and<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.369> I've<00:02:02.550> had<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.849> do<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:04.530> run<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
and all I've had to do is just run it

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.969 
and all I've had to do is just run it
and<00:02:05.399> grease<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.209> if<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.110> maintain<00:02:07.590> them<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and grease it if you maintain them and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.940 
and grease it if you maintain them and
keep<00:02:08.250> them<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.849> stay<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.090> top<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.950> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
keep them up and stay on top of them you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
keep them up and stay on top of them you
know<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> module<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.420> will<00:02:12.920> last<00:02:14.660> 50,000

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
know the module I think will last 50,000

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.520 
know the module I think will last 50,000
hours<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:17.010> don't<00:02:17.250> use<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:18.140> Tier<00:02:19.140> four<00:02:19.170> in

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
hours and they don't use a Tier four in

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.070 
hours and they don't use a Tier four in
and<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> huge<00:02:22.879> plus<00:02:23.239> when<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.659> comes<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and that is a huge plus when it comes to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.949 
and that is a huge plus when it comes to
maintaining<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.010> long<00:02:25.220> life<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.420> I've<00:02:26.690> run

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
maintaining and long life and I've run

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.229 
maintaining and long life and I've run
other<00:02:27.170> machines<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.640> can't<00:02:28.909> beat<00:02:29.120> him

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
other machines and you can't beat him

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.440 
other machines and you can't beat him
until<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.750> mean<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.080> just<00:02:30.140> can't<00:02:31.180> we've<00:02:32.180> always

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
until I mean you just can't we've always
