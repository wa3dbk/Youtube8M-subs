00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello to all I present you my all 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 last build in lego 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.150
 so I'm really happy it's 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 one is a desolate gun eagle good 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 go watch a tutorial on the internet 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.029
 even yes you could not exactly 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.840
 do everything the same when I was not 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.059
 really all the pieces is good and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.670
 also do a little football level 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 system because it works and something 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 that did not work very well but it pulls 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.120
 always that pulls very well 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.280
 elastic 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 so we ask you what it is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:56.360
 that it must simulate ammunition I 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:56.360
 think she's me it's not very easy 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:11.630
 but here is the content he can he put 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 really a lot of momentum elastics 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 so it's really handy and that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.650
 can pull them very far frankly I 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.369
 really do not know how even the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.860
 elastic 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.470
 so we remove this gop party 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.660
 and so I said this part so I 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:40.660
 love to him attached to each other because 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.520
 before that should move back forward again 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.380
 coach shot but it did not work very 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.160
 well then after I said to myself you dare 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.170
 is removed 6 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.090
 this system will always attract 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.560
 well so here in the description I 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.770
 you will also put the link of the video 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:05.740
 of the tutorial so so inside the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.300
 system so the war does it 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.300
 operates this part and after seeing that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.030
 I saw that there are elastics on the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.120
 cogwheel here that makes it 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 automatically turn to the left 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.070
 will turn in the opposite direction of 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.890
 Clockwise 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.459
 so after when we pull the trigger 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.790
 it goes like that hop and then after that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.140
 can release elastics 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.769
 so yes good it's true you always have to 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.830
 open to reload it's true it's 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.769
 a little pity but hey it's not 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:51.940
 used to 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:55.739
 so if we planned we are in camille 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.739
 the girl of the time we can give 6 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:11.180
 a little much anyway it's not so 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.709
 I will be able to put the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.829
 elastic because jam 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:23.840
 camera is not very practical 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:25.159
 so well we will do I come back all of 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.760
 following would find a place for the 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:32.359
 ask for you to see again so 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.579
 this is a good support I have 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.769
 several elastic that are not the 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.519
 even so it's okay they're not going all 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 gone to a distance so we place 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:50.720
 the elastic a flair changes not very 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:53.780
 hold well possible that's worse 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.909
 oh yes I forgot must be it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.129
 like this here because otherwise she is 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.859
 enough who will leave alone without you 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:05.359
 did not ask anything here you put 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.549
 in a time to listen to them in one of 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:11.900
 reminded white sprockets like on this 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.010
 video you're turning around you to 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.079
 the spied lagaf is 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.789
 and here you can put another one 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:21.789
 for me I put people to put 3 may 3 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.409
 that I found here 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.660
 Will we 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.830
 good times that shot when the flame is 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.290
 buy because you see one 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.380
 activate it stop here and then there 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.560
 stickley he's just a few few 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.870
 notches of power so go away after 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.730
 when we let go of that, let 's go ahead 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.280
 after that I think you understood 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:12.880
 even if I click a little bit wrong I 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:23.210
 believe then we close the machine up 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:23.750
 so good I think we'll go to 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.710
 tests 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.270
 not a small second so we're back here 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.990
 for the final test 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:42.260
 so yes it will attract the world I you 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:45.530
 shows a fact yes there are more 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.540
 far away from others so there it was they 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.670
 are leaving more than three meters away 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.270
 so we have one 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:06:00.620
 this box and the one the most one 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.870
 other there and last the stronger the more 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.720
 me up 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.910
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.810
 will have pleased 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.330
 do not hesitate to put a small 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.530
 comment and where a little green thumb and 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.940
 maybe subscribe to my channel 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.940
 was going soon
