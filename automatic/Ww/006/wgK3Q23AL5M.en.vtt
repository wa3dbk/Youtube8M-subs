00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 with fÃ©lix played in france 12 think 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.320
 She stays here and here to 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.410
 push three-way switch 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.179
 and here's the same thing I knew her 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.139
 is widely used for network making 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.330
 want to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.000
 everything is very easy you get 7 there's a side 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.720
 your time from the other 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.850
 There you pick up three time, I take time. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:39.360
 to climb low and three over 3 71 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:43.520
 3 under 3 and 25 and pulls up the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.520
 next door outside is always cool from the outside 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 but if she goes over three for 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 low of 2 I make this layer of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 gray the same thing on the other side you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:09.710
 pulls you to do below 3 and by 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710
 top of three 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.040
 The resource you get the next pulls through 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.040
 top of three under 2 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.770
 it will be more the other side 60 pulling 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.840
 you never have people asking me 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.200
 Why do you pull you can not pull 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.560
 much can not pull the more you 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.820
 Pull it but it will stay the xv will appear 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 It will look more beautiful. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 so you can pull there for more than 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.869
 three over three and always pulls 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 return 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.080
 then you come here again xuxa that goes 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:05.170
 squeeze in the camera from behind you pull 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.170
 over 3 063 below 2 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:17.520
 the other side the same thing because for 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.790
 down from 3 over three 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.040
 Warm and beautiful, this net is very 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.170
 used heavily used to make open network 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:51.299
 is that even I 'm not making a model 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:51.299
