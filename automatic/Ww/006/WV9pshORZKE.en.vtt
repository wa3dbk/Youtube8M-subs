and I'm actually going to start blending

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
and I'm actually going to start blending
the<00:01:04.650> kale<00:01:04.860> first<00:01:05.250> cuz<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.420> bit

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the kale first cuz it's a little bit

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:29.940 
the kale first cuz it's a little bit
more<00:01:06.810> course<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> takes<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.040> bit

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
