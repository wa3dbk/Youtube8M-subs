00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it begins and it ends different I took a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.730

trained extra hard early nights good
males<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.420> made<00:01:26.689> sure<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:26.899> was<00:01:27.020> really<00:01:27.289> on<00:01:27.380> top

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
males just made sure I was really on top

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.830 
males just made sure I was really on top
of<00:01:27.649> everything<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.310> just<00:01:29.030> came<00:01:29.210> over<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.719> give

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
of everything and just came over to give

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.660 
of everything and just came over to give
it<00:01:29.930> my<00:01:30.020> best<00:01:30.200> shot<00:01:30.289> it's<00:01:30.950> not<00:01:31.189> something<00:01:31.549> you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
it my best shot it's not something you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.760 
it my best shot it's not something you
can<00:01:31.850> do<00:01:32.060> in<00:01:32.210> two<00:01:32.420> weeks<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.869> be<00:01:32.990> prepared<00:01:33.500> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
can do in two weeks and be prepared and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.940 
can do in two weeks and be prepared and
I<00:01:33.890> think<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:35.090> long<00:01:35.359> preparation<00:01:35.869> process<00:01:36.680> is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
I think the long preparation process is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.580 
I think the long preparation process is
what<00:01:37.189> turns<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.670> into<00:01:37.820> such<00:01:38.180> an<00:01:38.930> emotional

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
what turns it into such an emotional

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.160 
what turns it into such an emotional
event<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.280> you're<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.939> involved<00:01:41.869> and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
event because you're so involved and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.109 
event because you're so involved and
