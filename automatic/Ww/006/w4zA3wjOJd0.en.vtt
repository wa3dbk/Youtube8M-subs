00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 for the next exercise you need eight 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.700
 biel without these will be in two corners in 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.630
 the riding track distributes dirk schlimbach 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 through leads the first corner with rosebud 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.640
 and then put the mare 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.570
 after turning away at a and joining the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.430
 Connection through the second corner also 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.840
 one wanted may for a change 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 to be built in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.150
 The mare looks up with her inner eye 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.500
 the pylons and can be so easier 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.500
 set and bend 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.540
 Exercise 42 lanes for the development of a 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 traversal that is folker oppitz timings 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.280
 tips for preparation with roms partie 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.710
 there was no clear needle through the streets 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.560
 cracked 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.190
 The latter starts all complemented 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.850
 because you let them rather alone the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.720
 Saale 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.650
 this continues traversal on and on 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.200
 leave alone again 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.390
 It was good to need it again 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.830
 what we achieved, we have two things 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.869
 but he should continue to combine 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.369
 learn to cross the horse more 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.710
 get that he says through the alley 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.930
 movie show possible and want to go there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
 the other side and the rider land in 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 the traverse to look where he goes 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 want 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 the valuation wide open in the next 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.490
 guest it will be just this again 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.780
 Change the gymnastics position bend 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.150
 just make it very clear here 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.260
 which one alone without guest not so 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.710
 clearly working out often works straight 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.840
 to let 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.570
 look it will be in the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.869
 traverse already knows that and will 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.150
 alone leave the blue-yellow 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 Gasse would be moved a few meters 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 This will make the traverse longer 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.470
 Surroundings look and seek 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.440
 look over it want to look over 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.730
 want and let alone do that and 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.959
 again a number stand we be 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.180
 even more want to happen the horse 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.920
 knows where it should go through the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 Gasse now we want it again 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.560
 steeper make it even more intersect 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.440
 got to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:37.840
 and over position keep well and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 Leave alone if you take a short step 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.910
 break on the given train before it gets in 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.900
 final training of a zigzag 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 traver saale goes 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.489
 I have to then I make the feeling 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.470
 did it again needs it now and it 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.840
 is appropriate and to progress to find 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.819
 I think such a scheme is so wrong 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 just like in che you drive in one 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.720
 set or set a specific height 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.450
 joint that is in my opinion so wrong 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.739
 I think the physique of the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.750
 character of that would be that the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.849
 The horse's characteristics must be a horse 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.709
 that's why it's there 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.870
 Partially worth every horse has to be 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.060
 own pace makes it feel good 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.980
 horse had a head setting of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.019
 redeem your neck and work wherever you are 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.159
 feel good I have to find out and 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.329
 arminia the right side then you go 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.819
 yes faster because if it is 40 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.599
 Feeling good, you can work and not 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.060
 if in the Kremlin 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.859
 that too close and how that too far 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.659
 I think is a point where goes 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.409
 ultimately in the overall statistic we 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.409
 do not do well back 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.549
 eurosport has shown that we are the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.099
 optical stimuli of dual activation too 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.609
 Greater balance and concentration 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.609
 to have
