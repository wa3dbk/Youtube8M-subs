of black for the base coat and then four

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450 
of black for the base coat and then four
different<00:01:15.840> shades<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.200> gray<00:01:16.409> went<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> with

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
different shades of gray went in with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
different shades of gray went in with
dry<00:01:17.700> brushing<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> create<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:18.930> type<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
dry brushing to create the right type of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.609 
dry brushing to create the right type of
textures<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> tones<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.049> for<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> blue<00:01:22.290> same

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
textures and tones and for the blue same

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.109 
textures and tones and for the blue same
thing<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.830> did<00:01:22.950> dark<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.909> black

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
thing we did dark I'm going to the black

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.539 
thing we did dark I'm going to the black
base<00:01:24.390> coat<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:25.470> navy<00:01:26.280> blue<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.189> mostly

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
base coat then navy blue it was mostly

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
base coat then navy blue it was mostly
dry<00:01:29.729> brushing<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.930> two<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:31.409> shades<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
dry brushing and then two more shades of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
dry brushing and then two more shades of
blue<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.630> create<00:01:33.900> an<00:01:34.200> almost

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
blue on top of that to create an almost

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
blue on top of that to create an almost
denim<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> pants<00:01:36.090> he's<00:01:36.180> supposed<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
denim look to the pants he's supposed to

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
denim look to the pants he's supposed to
look<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.689> jeans<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.500> came<00:01:37.890> out

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
look like jeans a little bit came out

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
look like jeans a little bit came out
pretty<00:01:38.130> good<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.460> think

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pretty good I think

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
pretty good I think
it's<00:01:40.259> hard<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> create<00:01:41.009> texture<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> by

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it's hard to create texture just by

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
it's hard to create texture just by
using<00:01:42.119> paint<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.100> looks<00:01:44.250> pretty

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
using paint so I think it looks pretty

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.469 
using paint so I think it looks pretty
good<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.780> last<00:01:46.350> thing<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.680> did<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:47.520> gave

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
good then the last thing I did was gave

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
good then the last thing I did was gave
him<00:01:48.630> his<00:01:48.960> darker<00:01:49.500> fingernails<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.130> toenails

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.660 
him his darker fingernails and toenails
just<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.049> him<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> little

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
just to kind of make him look a little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.480 
just to kind of make him look a little
used<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.060> little<00:01:54.240> dirty<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.170> say<00:01:55.490> all

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
used a little dirty you could say all

the room really he retains all of his
articulation<00:02:06.170> except<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.290> got<00:02:07.439> rid<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the fray on the pants and because he has

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
for it also like I normally do with my

for it also like I normally do with my
hulks<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.080> got<00:02:17.230> rid<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> foot<00:02:17.800> articulation

hulks I got rid of the foot articulation
I<00:02:18.850> sculpt<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.900> over<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.740> don't<00:02:20.770> really

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
I sculpt it over that you don't really

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.010 
I sculpt it over that you don't really
need<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.670> Hulk<00:02:21.880> he's<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.360> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> be<00:02:22.720> in

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
need it for Hulk he's not going to be in

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.870 
need it for Hulk he's not going to be in
that<00:02:23.230> dynamic<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.950> pose<00:02:24.130> probably<00:02:24.700> since

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
that dynamic of a pose probably since

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300 
that dynamic of a pose probably since
he's<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> bulky<00:02:25.480> figure<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.070> makes<00:02:27.220> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
he's a bulky figure so and it makes a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.770 
he's a bulky figure so and it makes a
little<00:02:27.430> less<00:02:27.580> stable<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.270> went<00:02:28.480> ahead<00:02:28.570> and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
little less stable so I went ahead and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.040 
little less stable so I went ahead and
got<00:02:28.870> rid<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:30.150> otherwise<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.660> pretty

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
got rid of that otherwise it's pretty

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.140 
got rid of that otherwise it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:32.410> custom<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.940> said

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
straightforward custom like I said

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.510 
straightforward custom like I said
there's<00:02:34.420> no<00:02:34.630> joint<00:02:35.380> rub<00:02:35.650> anywhere<00:02:36.040> all<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
there's no joint rub anywhere all the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160 
there's no joint rub anywhere all the
joints<00:02:36.670> are<00:02:36.880> good<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.810> go

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
joints are good to go

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.810 
joints are good to go
so<00:02:38.740> there<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.160> go<00:02:39.280> let<00:02:39.460> me<00:02:39.490> know<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.790> think

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
so there you go let me know you think

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820 
so there you go let me know you think

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
keep an eye out for more customs I'll be
