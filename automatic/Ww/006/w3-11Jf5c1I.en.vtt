00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
I've been collecting this these dragons

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.900 
I've been collecting this these dragons
for<00:00:29.930> Dooney<00:00:30.320> my<00:00:30.529> son<00:00:33.100> said<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.130> them<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:34.760> it

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
for Dooney my son said to them and it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.790 
for Dooney my son said to them and it
did<00:00:35.090> take<00:00:35.570> me<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.750> while<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.020> find<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:36.739> I

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
did take me a while to find this and I

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.959 
did take me a while to find this and I
ultimately<00:00:37.250> found<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:37.760> at<00:00:37.880> Walmart<00:00:39.579> so<00:00:40.579> it's

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
ultimately found it at Walmart so it's

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.790 
ultimately found it at Walmart so it's
kind<00:00:41.239> of<00:00:41.329> hard<00:00:41.960> plastic

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
kind of hard plastic

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.170 
kind of hard plastic
well<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:44.090> wings<00:00:44.390> are<00:00:44.780> kind<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.200> see-through

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
well the wings are kind of see-through

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.030 
well the wings are kind of see-through
us<00:00:47.350> is<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.770> body<00:00:50.079> you<00:00:51.079> can<00:00:51.290> tell<00:00:51.559> it<00:00:51.739> kind<00:00:51.980> of

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
us is the body you can tell it kind of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.889 
us is the body you can tell it kind of
has<00:00:52.190> like<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.610> mechanism<00:00:53.329> for<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.660> lighting

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
has like the mechanism for the lighting

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:02.770 
has like the mechanism for the lighting
in<00:00:54.200> there<00:00:56.890> basically<00:00:57.890> you<00:01:00.760> light<00:01:01.760> up<00:01:01.789> doing

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
in there basically you light up doing

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.879 
in there basically you light up doing
this<00:01:03.050> pressing<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.129> little<00:01:05.889> mechanical

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:06.889 
this pressing this little mechanical

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
this pressing this little mechanical
thing<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.279> has<00:01:07.490> right<00:01:07.789> in<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.029> back<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.759> it

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
thing it has right in the back and it

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:21.380 
thing it has right in the back and it
also<00:01:11.090> sticks<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.749> tongue<00:01:12.020> out

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.610 

Dooney<00:01:22.390> also<00:01:22.690> likes<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:22.990> pull<00:01:23.290> them<00:01:23.440> by<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
Dooney also likes to pull them by the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.170 
Dooney also likes to pull them by the
time<00:01:23.950> then<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.370> get<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> light<00:01:29.729> tough<00:01:30.729> but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
time then you get the light tough but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.900 
time then you get the light tough but
flexible<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:35.190> these<00:01:36.190> things<00:01:36.520> here<00:01:36.880> are

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
flexible and these things here are

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.430 
flexible and these things here are
flexible<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:39.550> these<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.080> rest<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
flexible and these and the rest of the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.010 
flexible and these and the rest of the
body<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:42.159> hard<00:01:42.759> plastic<00:01:43.270> there's<00:01:43.509> not<00:01:43.690> no

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
body is just hard plastic there's not no

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.160 
body is just hard plastic there's not no
movement<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.030> head<00:01:46.030> or<00:01:46.540> anything<00:01:46.780> because

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
movement in the head or anything because

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:58.350 
movement in the head or anything because
of<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:49.539> mechanism<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:57.360> blending

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
of the mechanism so this is the blending

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.780 
of the mechanism so this is the blending
with<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.600> eyes<00:01:58.810> their<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:01.060> nostril<00:02:01.509> sir
