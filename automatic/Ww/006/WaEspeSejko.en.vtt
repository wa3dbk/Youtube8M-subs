with<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> HD<00:02:04.290> PVR<00:02:04.320> 2<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.729> what<00:02:05.939> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
with the HD PVR 2 so this is what it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.180 
with the HD PVR 2 so this is what it
looks<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:06.810> its<00:02:06.960> presented

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
looks like this is how its presented

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
looks like this is how its presented
inside<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> box<00:02:08.550> let's<00:02:09.360> take<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.750> bits<00:02:09.989> out

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
inside the box let's take these bits out

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.790 
inside the box let's take these bits out
one<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> time<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.489> got<00:02:11.520> here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
one at a time so we have got here

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.070 
one at a time so we have got here
cable<00:02:13.370> which<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.640> going<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.850> go<00:02:14.000> out<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.690> HD

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
cable which is going to go out of the HD

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.360 
cable which is going to go out of the HD
PVR<00:02:15.110> 2<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.040> into<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.330> component<00:02:18.290> output<00:02:18.830> so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
PVR 2 and into a component output so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.680 
PVR 2 and into a component output so
this<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.790> work<00:02:19.970> with<00:02:20.300> something

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
this is going to work with something

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.280 
this is going to work with something
perhaps<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.440> ps3<00:02:21.830> or<00:02:22.250> an<00:02:22.520> xbox<00:02:22.730> 360<00:02:23.540> via

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
perhaps like a ps3 or an xbox 360 via

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.500 
perhaps like a ps3 or an xbox 360 via
the<00:02:24.470> component<00:02:25.040> connections<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.390> this

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the component connections so we get this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.570 
the component connections so we get this
sort<00:02:26.780> breakout<00:02:27.260> cable<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:28.250> good<00:02:28.400> they

sort breakout cable really good they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.820 
sort breakout cable really good they
include<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.210> let's<00:02:30.110> pop<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.500> off<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.680> one

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
include that let's pop that off to one

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.990
