00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
is that although public schools have

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.970 
is that although public schools have
become<00:02:35.569> much<00:02:35.780> more<00:02:35.989> segregated<00:02:36.530> since<00:02:36.860> the

become much more segregated since the

segregated than that and it's

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.710 
segregated than that and it's
segregation<00:02:46.010> not<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.430> by<00:02:46.610> race<00:02:46.849> but<00:02:47.299> also<00:02:47.450> by
