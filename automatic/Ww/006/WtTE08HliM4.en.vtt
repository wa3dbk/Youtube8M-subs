you

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.570 

so<00:00:12.360> all<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> break<00:00:12.930> snake<00:00:13.200> basically<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.520> a

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
simple item that's going to connect the

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200 
simple item that's going to connect the
frame<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> bike<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.190> our<00:00:17.670> brake<00:00:17.910> lever

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.019 
frame of the bike to our brake lever
this<00:00:18.930> will<00:00:19.320> stop<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.950> grass<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.790> you've<00:00:20.939> ever

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
this will stop the grass if you've ever

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
this will stop the grass if you've ever
got<00:00:21.300> grass<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.960> sticks<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:22.410> jammed<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> here

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
got grass and sticks all jammed in here

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.920 
got grass and sticks all jammed in here
which<00:00:23.610> usually<00:00:23.849> end<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.240> jamming<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.750> rear

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
which usually end up jamming your rear

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
brake leaver on not a good thing it also

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
brake leaver on not a good thing it also
stops<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.800> extension<00:00:29.190> of<00:00:29.400> the

stops you from over extension of the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.849 
stops you from over extension of the
brake<00:00:29.670> too<00:00:29.850> far<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.570> too<00:00:31.050> far<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.680> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
brake too far down and too far up if you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.470 
brake too far down and too far up if you
end<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.070> hitting<00:00:32.250> something<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.269> we're<00:00:33.449> just

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
end up hitting something so we're just

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
end up hitting something so we're just
going<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:33.989> keep<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.350> tension<00:00:34.769> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
going to have to keep the tension of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
going to have to keep the tension of
this<00:00:35.190> brake<00:00:35.790> snake<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.449> just<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.199> we<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
this brake snake here just so we have

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
this brake snake here just so we have
enough<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.280> use<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> brake<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.570> enough

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
enough to use the brake but not enough

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.630 
enough to use the brake but not enough
to<00:00:39.870> overextend<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.590> let's<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.280> bolted

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
to overextend it let's get this bolted

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.540 
to overextend it let's get this bolted
on

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.520 

now<00:00:47.550> break<00:00:48.180> snakes<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> universal<00:00:49.320> fit

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
now break snakes are a universal fit

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.400 
now break snakes are a universal fit
item<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.489> they<00:00:51.030> fit<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> same<00:00:51.840> basic<00:00:52.260> concept

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
item so they fit the same basic concept

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
item so they fit the same basic concept
on<00:00:52.860> most<00:00:53.129> bikes<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.550> may<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:53.940> some

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on most bikes you may have to do some

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.509 
on most bikes you may have to do some
adjustments<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> bikes<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.250> actually

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
adjustments a lot of bikes will actually

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.549 
adjustments a lot of bikes will actually
have<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> hole<00:00:56.910> pre-drilled<00:00:57.540> here<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> don't<00:00:58.019> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
have a hole pre-drilled here I don't I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
have a hole pre-drilled here I don't I
need<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.890> loop<00:00:59.160> my<00:01:00.000> brake<00:01:00.300> snake<00:01:00.540> cable

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
need to loop my brake snake cable

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
need to loop my brake snake cable
through<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.650> background<00:01:02.519> there's<00:01:02.699> no<00:01:02.820> hole

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
through and background there's no hole

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
through and background there's no hole
so<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.659> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.900> drill<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> quick<00:01:04.379> hole

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so I'm just going to drill a quick hole

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
so I'm just going to drill a quick hole
on<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.830> brake<00:01:05.040> lever<00:01:05.399> right<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.180> near

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to get my skid plate off I can just

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.529 
to get my skid plate off I can just
unbolt<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.190> from<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.460> frame<00:01:44.729> let's<00:01:45.300> get<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
unbolt it from my frame let's get this

00:01:45.539 --> 00:02:07.590 
unbolt it from my frame let's get this
put<00:01:45.720> together

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.380 

so<00:02:08.600> now<00:02:09.220> if<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.520> install<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.180> my

so now if I go to install it with my
skid<00:02:11.810> plate<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.290> put<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.740> finger

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
skid plate and just put that in finger

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.949 
skid plate and just put that in finger
tape<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:16.670> now<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:19.610> able<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> run<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.240> through

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
tape for now be able to run this through
