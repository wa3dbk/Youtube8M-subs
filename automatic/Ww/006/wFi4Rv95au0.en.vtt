00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we've kind of developed a pretty good

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.880 
we've kind of developed a pretty good
rivalry<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.439> recent<00:01:50.369> memory<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
last last three games have been really

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.270 
last last three games have been really
close<00:01:55.020> last<00:01:55.439> possession<00:01:55.979> type<00:01:56.159> games<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.820> and

of<00:02:05.610> motivation<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.540> itself<00:02:06.979> certainly<00:02:07.979> we

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
of motivation in itself certainly we

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.390 
of motivation in itself certainly we
thought<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.030> game<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.860> did<00:02:11.190> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
thought that this this game or I did I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.860 
thought that this this game or I did I
can't<00:02:11.700> speak<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:11.940> others<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.660> game

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
can't speak for others but this game

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
can't speak for others but this game
would<00:02:12.989> certainly<00:02:13.290> have

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
would certainly have

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.260 
would certainly have
difference<00:02:14.180> implications<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.810> far<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:17.270> you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
difference implications as far as you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.970
