the chair could typically you know fall
back<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.350> designed<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.770> help<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460 
back but this is designed to help it
slide<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.880> instead<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.900> tipping<00:02:25.260> back

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
