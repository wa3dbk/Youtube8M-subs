 how about friends how have they been i am 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.660
 ryder here with another new map for 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.250
 you and a map that is pretty 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.420
 great is a map of modern warfare 2 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.220
 called hard drive and that does not lend itself 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.960
 map I always liked to play it in the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.510
 modern warfare 2 and the truth is very 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.430
 similar as you may be seeing and then 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.199
 I hope you like it, you know that the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.119
 download link will be in the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.570
 description this is still a map to 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.280
 pvp player against player versus player 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.040
 or whatever you want to call 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.350
 Well try to make two teams and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.649
 Because everyone chooses their different 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.360
 weapons bow arrows rocks and then there as 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.910
 if we were playing modern warfare 2 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.600
 or so pulling the arrows give 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.489
 other pieces 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.590
 because the map is very good, the truth is 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.809
 I recommend it I am ryder choose the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.809
 description of your like and back
