00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:11.539
 Yes is the corner of teaching boss Energy Research Institute god I was beginning 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.230
 Now it is effective if the corner is answered by a question from you. 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.380
 But 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.940
 I'll come early 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.130
 Tokyo Seaside Park of 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.350
 It is a question from 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.539
 I thing it is good to put the package to say that the package Desuggatente 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.850
 this 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.250
 Say good or bad 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.290
 than 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 You Please, that everyone this idea that 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.600
 There is a car 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.530
 The Tteyuu time I I car Well test took license of um 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.250
 I have no application and no teaching 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.670
 Hill start and Kato' a total manual 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.710
 Right? 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.240
 so 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 It is a well- written manual, but now 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.930
 That auto nostalgic, so that's the driver's license with an automa's car ok 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.080
 It's a license like that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.670
 I in this 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:18.320
 Manual operation was difficult with driving a car- it was difficult 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 This happens Te Garn when connecting come off've cladding I or accidentally immediately play 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.120
 I think that the engine has stopped when I get through 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:31.570
 That technique is not really that kind of technique, though 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.210
 Otsu Mananka is a great technique technique 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 It is how to drive a car to use 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 This 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 We had shifted from manual to automa 2 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.140
 If it's a bus now, it's probably an automa 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.060
 I Toka bust cart rack 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 Thanks to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 Everyone started to ride 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 Toka 100 times in that woman to take it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.300
 Even if it was possible elderly person, it is swiss with automatic 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.270
 Head office day included 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.170
 What people are riding in the car and say what happened is much by it become such a thing 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.429
 Increased 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.270
 Hey, I thought 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.800
 so 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.480
 I think this is this 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 Hey when the say'm going to pack a short Atchotto shopping 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 Mom is going to go shopping and the peak of the car is a situation where it can go right now 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.350
 The 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.760
 The old days did not come out such a thing 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.450
 So my mother did not have a license first 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.319
 Why I did not have a license 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.550
 Because I clutch was difficult Tteyuu Tara This Tara How to go doing a good mom 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.170
 One was 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.170
 This is what I mean 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.849
 Well I I'm thinking that the Do's technical progress 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:58.340
 That's why I say fishing 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:03.019
 It seems that the more difficult ones and the ones with techniques are better 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 I think I'm a bad condition in such Well industry or that such interpretation 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.380
 Well I think it's a mistake 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 No one 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:18.660
 Maybe garden if if you do not Ika and to those obtained easily, for example, the same kind of result 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.790
 I think it's a lie I want to drive a car from the manual 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.620
 Things like say now automatism 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.430
 Maybe I should do the soup industry too 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.609
 I am already in the 21st century 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.329
 I do n't think that's it, but it's still there 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:40.939
 Nde people of the industry that care is not about is too much 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:48.760
 In the place where it is said that this is not possible I go to the package and say in the pop 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:48.760
 In short, I think men and women like things said by automa
