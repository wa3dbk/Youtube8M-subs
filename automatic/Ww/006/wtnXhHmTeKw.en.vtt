00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.460
 Lumia Nokia phones have a 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.190
 hard reset universal using 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.379
 combination of buttons 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.690
 I say it 's universal because so far 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.950
 All models known models 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.289
 can be prescribed in the same way with 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.199
 a slight variant in the form of 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.250
 perform the procedure especially in 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.590
 the 1,710 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.160
 the procedure consists of first 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:38.160
 place on turning off the phone and pressing 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 The following buttons simultaneously 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 they must be the button d 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.160
 lower volume 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.360
 The power button 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.950
 and the camera button of some models 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.310
 the power button is found 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.310
 above 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.570
 in this case I have one 1610 and it's with the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.720
 that I'm going to demonstrate the procedure 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.310
 then had my phone turned off I'm going 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 to press 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.229
 the key d 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 lower volume on and camera 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.370
 I press once the phone vibrates 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.750
 loose 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.750
 and I hope 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 there it looks like I already appeared 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.210
 home screen of the phones 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.720
 lumen 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.619
 this procedure serves to eliminate 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 user locks 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.590
 the lumia 710 what you do is press 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.360
 the power buttons lower volume and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.259
 camera 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 until the phone lights the screen 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.870
 in a tenuous way 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.330
 when that happens 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.330
 we know that we have made 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.140
 correctly 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.430
 it seems all factory reset this what 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 I mention because it is possible that 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.530
 that this procedure works for some 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.500
 another model that goes to the future 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.920
 although for now the procedure more 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.510
 used is the one that I have just described 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.750
 press the three buttons when the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.850
 vibrate phone let go of the button 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.850
 turned on and we wait
