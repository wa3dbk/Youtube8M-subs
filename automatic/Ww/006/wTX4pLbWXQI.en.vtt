00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.950
 initiating session to me is not going to 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.860
 open this session probably because 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.390
 the dns that I have put will not be 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.340
 available surely but good 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.890
