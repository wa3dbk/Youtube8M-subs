00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
have any effect on gas companies if they

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.350 
have any effect on gas companies if they
were<00:01:55.960> place<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:57.850> lose<00:01:58.149> money<00:01:59.280> well<00:02:00.360> that's

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
electric car first of all do you know it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.400 
electric car first of all do you know it
in<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.740> electric<00:02:52.130> car<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:53.110> basically<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> car

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
in the electric car is basically a car

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.620 
in the electric car is basically a car
that<00:02:54.590> runs<00:02:54.710> on<00:02:54.920> batteries<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:55.970> instead<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
that runs on batteries but instead of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.480 
that runs on batteries but instead of
gas<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.770> harp<00:02:58.450> basically<00:02:59.450> but<00:02:59.690> all

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
using this would have on the Earth's if

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.020 
using this would have on the Earth's if
it<00:03:10.050> was<00:03:10.260> introduced<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.130> replaced<00:03:11.640> the

it was introduced and replaced the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.410 
it was introduced and replaced the
regular<00:03:12.450> gas
