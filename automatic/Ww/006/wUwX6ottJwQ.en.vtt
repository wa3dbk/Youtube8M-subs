Quebec<00:07:23.439> I<00:07:24.959> mean<00:07:26.339> but<00:07:27.339> I<00:07:27.579> don't<00:07:27.729> think<00:07:27.849> the

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.089 
Quebec I mean but I don't think the

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:32.489 
Quebec I mean but I don't think the
game's<00:07:28.360> going<00:07:28.569> to<00:07:28.629> end<00:07:28.779> this<00:07:28.899> turn<00:07:31.379> the<00:07:32.379> only

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:32.499 
game's going to end this turn the only

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.279 
game's going to end this turn the only
way<00:07:32.589> that<00:07:32.739> would<00:07:32.829> happen<00:07:32.889> is<00:07:33.189> if<00:07:33.279> he<00:07:34.139> kills<00:07:35.139> her

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:35.289 
way that would happen is if he kills her

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.519 
way that would happen is if he kills her
over<00:07:35.619> so<00:07:36.579> journey<00:07:36.939> on<00:07:37.239> do<00:07:37.449> cleric<00:07:37.839> to<00:07:38.409> make

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:38.529 
over so journey on do cleric to make

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:39.719 
over so journey on do cleric to make
that<00:07:38.679> a<00:07:38.709> little<00:07:38.860> bigger<00:07:39.129> I<00:07:39.429> don't<00:07:39.699> think

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729 
that a little bigger I don't think

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:46.429 
that a little bigger I don't think
that's<00:07:39.969> going<00:07:40.119> to<00:07:40.179> happen<00:07:41.819> yeah<00:07:42.819> one<00:07:44.879> even<00:07:45.879> try

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:46.439 
that's going to happen yeah one even try

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:48.479 
that's going to happen yeah one even try
probably<00:07:47.439> could<00:07:47.529> that<00:07:47.739> may<00:07:47.859> be<00:07:47.919> tricked<00:07:48.219> me<00:07:48.369> or

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:48.489 
probably could that may be tricked me or
