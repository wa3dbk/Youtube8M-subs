00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.340
 Today I will tell you about one thing in general 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.300
 at 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 as panel controls I myself 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.279
 very lazy in terms of reading instructions 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.390
 different and therefore not studied until 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 just have to walk 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 on my own , I’ll remind you initially 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 that we have 5 screens here two three 4 5 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.620
 6 screens 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.480
 here and to set up this screen example 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 I had to take 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.110
 went to the menu and there in this multiscreen 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 set up an example like this and pressing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 and holding the key 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 we can switch ie clock in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.590
 last video I showed it well, honestly 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 each time to climb here and so and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 tune very awkward today 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.530
 accidentally found a convenient control with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.070
 using this joystick now about 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 I'll tell you what the problem was 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 I keep on gas and I have to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.500
 after refueling so after refueling 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.090
 to fix at what point I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 tucked to count the mileage 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 approximately estimate how much gas to me 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 I left on the old panel updated 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 daily mileage and stayed after 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 resetting sid it is already there dry us 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.130
 then 450 500 kilometers that is to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.810
 knows when a couple refuel here I 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.210
 honestly couldn't find how long 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.649
 reset to this counter turned out to be much 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.619
 easier go here one multi screen 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.360
 press the reset key it is here itself 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.399
 basically press and hold here 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.710
 please counter reset 0 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.360
 kilometers further I need to adjust 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.229
 For example, I’m pressing this screen again. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.250
 reset key 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.400
 hold and here please oa 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.380
 changing buttons up and down I 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.680
 I switch the mode that is, what is not needed 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.140
 temperature instant travel time so 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.660
 further reset click turn on 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.270
 the next item so we go through 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.550
 on all counts 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.830
 here and get our updated data 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.220
 which we need now let 's go 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.680
 in calendar calendar and this function is not 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.030
 it works here it is not necessary but here 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.530
 just top speed on 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.780
 kilometers per hour that is after one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 Lenin simply will not show such 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.989
 useful material further 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.239
 separately there will be material about 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.010
 settings modes and diagnostics here 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.200
 thats but it will no longer 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.200
 switch barking signature and all bye
