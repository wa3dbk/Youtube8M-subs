00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the most beautiful phrase of love is always 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.060
 the most banal, the truest, the most 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.090
 used two simple words that make you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.630
 touch the sky with a finger or so 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.630
 Pizza 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.400
 if I'm not mistaken in my old video 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.500
 I told you that sooner or later I would have 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.360
 made one on the pizza and it was obvious seen 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.700
 that my favorite dish then at 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.630
 typical dish that everyone likes 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.630
 mongering ninja turtles of the goonies yes 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.290
 and with mcalister keys 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.750
 here is his very special pizza al 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.700
 cheese freely in my life 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.130
 I think I've never met anyone 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.530
 pizza do not like pizza 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.540
 manages to conquer me like no other 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.120
 you will be able to eat it for whole days 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.310
 without ever getting tired I literally make me 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 drool as homers would base on one 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.340
 donut then what we eat tonight 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.340
 ordered pizza 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.810
 although to be honest there is one thing that 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.390
 it disturbs me a lot as I am one 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.640
 extremely routine person 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.729
 they are also in the taste of pizza ie 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.560
 Spicy salami pizza all your life 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.479
 and it's something that bothers me because 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.479
 often I would like to try others 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.210
 tastes but I'm afraid to be disappointed you have 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.850
 decided what to take 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.909
 I want something different I believe 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.359
 that the gentlemen will take a maremonti 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.490
 they decided for apple spicy salami 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.770
 obviously this happens in restaurants 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.710
 and about restaurants I wanted to do 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.380
 a note on the orders because 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.929
 because in practically every restaurant 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
 I go to where the waiters have to take 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.170
 orders with tablets 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.210
 I don't say they don't seem to have 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 made things easier than when 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.569
 they used simple notepads ti 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.289
 then for me a spicy salami yes 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.289
 I'm a second 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:21.360
 I said he said a spicy salami 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.040
 true yes sometimes i really would like to know 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.380
 what happens they do when they continue to 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 stake with that style for tablet 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.840
 I repeat I say that with the block 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.300
 notes was much simpler than a 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.880
 marinara to be credible when I go 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.880
 also that of radio one of the purposes in 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.590
 italy okay you should go 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.170
 ok then when i'm home instead a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.519
 persist is another problem that 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.860
 tip to the bellboy 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.420
 more than a problem it is not a dilemma 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.910
 I still managed to figure out if 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.190
 actually tipping is one thing 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.220
 welcome to those who receive it or not and then 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.230
 how much of tip on one side I wouldn't want 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.110
 seem to be cheap but on the other not 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.450
 I would not even give you find in my opinion from 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.489
 good Italians we are none of 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
 we would like to leave a tip and this 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.470
 the bellboys know it as bellboys 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:26.540
 they know that we know they want it and 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:30.099
 as a tip I am 750 ok I see 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.099
 20 euro 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.579
 I'm giving her her pizza 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.510
 what does he do 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.240
 he doesn't give me the rest he uses soon or yes 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.629
 obviously when I talk about pizza I mean 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.879
 the pizza par excellence the Italian one 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.010
 I am more than convinced that what 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.170
 we know we exist from none 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.450
 other part in the world not where I am 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.489
 I was at least even paris where it is 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.830
 you know the French certainly don't get away with it 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.930
 bad in the kitchen and where I could 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:22.109
 experience your pizza in person 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.850
 trades and you who eat pizza 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.669
 usually let me know with a comment 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.900
 so that I too maybe one day 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.300
 mire will give up trying a different taste 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.490
 I remind you that if you want you can follow me 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.770
 on facebook on twitter and also on 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.780
 instagram that I did very recently 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.669
 finally I thank Danilo for my heart 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.650

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.000
