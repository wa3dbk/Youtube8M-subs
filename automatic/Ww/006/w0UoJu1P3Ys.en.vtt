00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 scarlett johansson as extraterrestrial the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.660
 hunting for men and making their meat 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.660
 there is to see each other know 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.860
 they rest alone so they find me 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 already beautiful 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.559
 can you do me? 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.990
 when did they have it? 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.990
 would 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 you do not want to 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.909
 other skaters and eight minutes from 16 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.289
 released years and is in 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.390
 Germany from the tenth october 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 direct to dvd and available on blu ray 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.360
 link for you as always in the video 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.280
 description and tells the story 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 an extraterrestrial played by 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.880
 scarlett johansson calling herself laura 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.709
 and with a delivery van through the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.150
 highlands in scotland are hunting 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.980
 She wants to do this on men 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 seduce but what they do not know 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.459
 it makes hunting for their meat because 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.349
 this is one on your home planet 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.030
 very special and she should 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.950
 make sure that there is more of it 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.599
 but most of them are supposed to seduce you 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.099
 Interesting the Skalitzer hands there 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.569
 it's another kid's actually 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.370
 often be seen naked times 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.209
 and there are some men to the right 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.769
 but that's the main one 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.390
 selling point of this film but 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.099
 one wonders then what is it about 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.660
 actually behind it then it will be 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.310
 bit difficult for the reason story 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.720
 as she told me, she too is the one 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.220
 actually the whole movie of the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.410
 first to last second about the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.030
 Dictated 108 minutes and above all 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 again and again when it comes to these of disposal 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.450
 moments gives a kind of artistic 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.370
 room with a pond and easy 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.720
 mirrored ground where both start 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.010
 to reveal a little bit again and again 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.970
 and then suddenly the men 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.010
 be collected 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.079
 there are also very quirky and almost 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.459
 very very very nightmarish 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.750
 pictures when it comes to this other gen 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.430
 effect when these men as suddenly 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.380
 leached out of her skin 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.910
 is that musically with that 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.230
 a psycho ton and there that one 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 It must be clear that one person can do that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.769
 or other very fragile nerves of 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 meet the audience and others the child 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.829
 is then again and again next to the right 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.209
 inconsequential moments of the scarlett 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.590
 johansson or laura transversely 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.870
 through the highlands are what men 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.459
 produced in a very cheap way 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.049
 where are you generally the movie one 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.850
 the race simply notices a stripe 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.930
 is not always a lot of budget 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.609
 again a strip of the same 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.780
 in between his little pricks again 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.920
 had where you noticed that now 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.569
 artistically interesting and 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.920
 artistically valuable but in many 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.139
 settings has the camera simply 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.579
 it does not matter for so long 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.930
 that you always have that feeling is that 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.430
 art now or is it just 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.170
 boring and exactly when this is 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.609
 feeling stops at a movie 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.109
 always a bit critical so that 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.120
 other skin at most a movie for 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.560
 cineasts is the otto normal cinemagoer 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.730
 will say okay, what am I got there 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.170
 seen now and maybe will 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.489
 a little betrayed a lot in the place 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.290
 where it says oh my god scarlett 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.060
 johansson naked but it consists of the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.010
 movie normal 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.060
 at most to three percent and there should 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.860
 you just do not mislead yourself 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.690
 Let this statement be in the end 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.370
 Other things are more of a kind 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.500
 experimental science fiction thriller 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.060
 for a special audience what I then 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 he is also allowed to enjoy these art films 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.090
 it is rare and they are strange 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.620
 you can then also speculate and 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.480
 especially who puzzle and discuss 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.980
 the shape of the aliens comes to light is the 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.780
 already a bit quirky and 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.669
 probably also different 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.470
 The most expensive scene in the movie should be called 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.970
 exactly for this audience is the film 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.080
 Worth seeing and gets from me as 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.300
 science fiction thriller the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.040
 experimental way seven and a half out of 10 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.510
 possible points and so glad that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.190
 I have two evaluations for that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.540
 otto normal cinco may be the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.100
 very very different 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.300
 just does not reflect any recommendation 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.160
 but rather a what the fuck 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.169
 moment trigger and get here the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.210
 film of me in the end only four and a half of 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.410
 10 possible points and is also one 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.940
 little questionable why you never 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.130
 brought in the cinema because just one 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.720
 such movie with this have turned red 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.669
 musical background music and the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.139
 unfolded quite different pictures 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.790
 actually only on the screen so 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.500
 right if that is only on blu ray dvd 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.760
 you should be able to work there 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.110
 question a bit critically but how 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.120
 said from the tenth october then 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.280
 Buy it and so if I 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.169
 through my revier to other child that 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.270
 like a thumb there if this video 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.770
 we did not leave that otherwise 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.180
 You know there are a few left 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.070
 and me around and tomorrow 15 clock of course 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.720
 at the latest a new video 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.060
 and then I hope here again 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.060
 with of course at 3
