had the armament haki on it and it
actually<00:05:16.560> sliced<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:18.280> arena<00:05:18.669> into<00:05:19.450> it

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
actually sliced the arena into it

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.340 
actually sliced the arena into it
basically<00:05:20.110> slice<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.800> arena<00:05:21.040> into<00:05:21.340> and

basically slice the arena into and

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.740 
basically slice the arena into and
toshio<00:05:23.350> just<00:05:23.800> went<00:05:24.430> right<00:05:24.850> through<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.510> and

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
toshio just went right through that and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.600 
toshio just went right through that and
that<00:05:26.020> was<00:05:26.169> pretty<00:05:26.350> much<00:05:26.500> game<00:05:26.800> over<00:05:27.010> for<00:05:27.370> him

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
that was pretty much game over for him

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.110 
that was pretty much game over for him
because<00:05:28.300> he<00:05:28.540> was<00:05:28.690> outside<00:05:29.169> of<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.470> arena<00:05:30.120> or
