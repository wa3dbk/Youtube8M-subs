Desire<00:00:38.910> eight<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.600> six<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
Desire eight one six think of this is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.369 
Desire eight one six think of this is
the<00:00:40.680> HTC<00:00:41.070> One<00:00:41.520> m8<00:00:41.879> plastic<00:00:42.600> kid-brother<00:00:43.050> it's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the HTC One m8 plastic kid-brother it's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
the HTC One m8 plastic kid-brother it's
got<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> lot<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> goodness<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> little

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
got a lot of the goodness but a little

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.299 
got a lot of the goodness but a little
bit<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> different<00:00:46.649> body<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bit of a different body so this is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650 
bit of a different body so this is
probably<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.879> coming<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> US<00:00:48.539> since

with some of their plastic design phones

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.800 
with some of their plastic design phones
although<00:01:16.950> certainly<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.369> prefer<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.210> aluminum

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
although certainly I prefer the aluminum

so<00:06:19.970> I<00:06:20.000> mentioned<00:06:20.240> HTC<00:06:21.020> One<00:06:21.199> a<00:06:21.229> lot<00:06:21.440> let's<00:06:21.530> go

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
so I mentioned HTC One a lot let's go

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.990 
so I mentioned HTC One a lot let's go
ahead<00:06:21.770> and<00:06:21.860> bring<00:06:22.010> that<00:06:22.070> guy<00:06:22.430> in<00:06:22.639> and<00:06:22.820> see<00:06:22.910> what

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
ahead and bring that guy in and see what

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.339 
ahead and bring that guy in and see what
these<00:06:23.090> two<00:06:23.150> look<00:06:23.449> like<00:06:23.599> side-by-side<00:06:23.870> so

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
these two look like side-by-side so

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.439 
these two look like side-by-side so
certainly<00:06:24.620> big<00:06:24.919> size<00:06:25.099> difference<00:06:25.130> 5.5<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.300> 5

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
certainly big size difference 5.5 and 5

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.870 
certainly big size difference 5.5 and 5
inches<00:06:26.720> so<00:06:26.780> if<00:06:26.930> by<00:06:27.020> my<00:06:27.199> keen<00:06:27.440> mass<00:06:27.650> kills<00:06:27.949> that

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
inches so if by my keen mass kills that

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.240 
inches so if by my keen mass kills that
is<00:06:29.060> half<00:06:29.389> an<00:06:29.599> inch<00:06:29.720> difference<00:06:29.979> I've<00:06:30.979> got<00:06:31.130> the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
is half an inch difference I've got the

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.620 
is half an inch difference I've got the
aluminum<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:31.940> plastic<00:06:32.330> here<00:06:32.570> it

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
aluminum and the plastic here it

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.850 
aluminum and the plastic here it
certainly<00:06:32.930> you<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.169> pick<00:06:33.380> what<00:06:33.530> you<00:06:33.650> what<00:06:33.770> you
