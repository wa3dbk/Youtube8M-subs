use<00:05:49.460> olive<00:05:49.850> oil<00:05:50.270> edge<00:05:50.750> control<00:05:51.350> and<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:53.270> I

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
use olive oil edge control and so I

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.580 
use olive oil edge control and so I
really<00:05:53.900> really<00:05:54.110> like<00:05:54.320> that

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
really really like that

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.190 
really really like that
I've<00:05:54.740> loved<00:05:55.040> edge<00:05:55.280> control<00:05:55.850> for<00:05:56.480> a<00:05:56.510> while<00:05:56.780> and

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
I've loved edge control for a while and

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.380 
I've loved edge control for a while and
I<00:05:57.740> actually<00:05:57.890> started<00:05:58.160> getting<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:58.760> when<00:05:59.060> I

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
I actually started getting this when I

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.140 
I actually started getting this when I
had<00:05:59.990> when<00:06:00.980> I<00:06:01.010> still<00:06:01.220> had<00:06:01.250> perms<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.940> weaves

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
had when I still had perms and weaves

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.170 
had when I still had perms and weaves
and<00:06:02.600> I<00:06:03.410> think<00:06:04.010> I've<00:06:04.130> used<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:04.670> much<00:06:04.820> that<00:06:05.030> my

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
and I think I've used it so much that my

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.420 
and I think I've used it so much that my
edges<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.960> my<00:06:06.230> hair<00:06:06.500> is<00:06:06.650> just<00:06:06.680> immune<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.310> it

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
edges and my hair is just immune to it

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.360 
edges and my hair is just immune to it
because<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.730> doesn't<00:06:07.880> work<00:06:08.320> it<00:06:09.320> doesn't<00:06:09.380> you

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
because it doesn't work it doesn't you

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.760 
because it doesn't work it doesn't you
know<00:06:10.490> hold<00:06:10.790> as<00:06:11.060> much<00:06:11.240> as<00:06:11.390> it<00:06:11.540> used<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.960> but<00:06:12.620> it

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
know hold as much as it used to but it

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.760 
know hold as much as it used to but it
does<00:06:12.980> give<00:06:13.370> my<00:06:13.940> edges<00:06:14.419> just<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.350> really<00:06:15.590> nice

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
does give my edges just a really nice

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.159 
does give my edges just a really nice
kind<00:06:16.010> of<00:06:16.160> curl<00:06:16.400> and<00:06:17.090> then<00:06:17.540> the<00:06:17.660> other<00:06:17.840> products

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
kind of curl and then the other products

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.500 
kind of curl and then the other products
that<00:06:18.200> I<00:06:18.290> use<00:06:18.530> are<00:06:18.680> kind<00:06:18.860> of<00:06:18.890> interchangeable<00:06:19.510> I

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
that I use are kind of interchangeable I

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.590 
that I use are kind of interchangeable I
have<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.169> Shea<00:06:21.410> Moisture<00:06:21.440> raw<00:06:22.040> shea<00:06:22.340> butter

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.860

reconstructive<00:06:24.340> elixir<00:06:25.810> finishing<00:06:26.810> the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
reconstructive elixir finishing the

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.110 
reconstructive elixir finishing the
elixir<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.410> I<00:06:27.980> really<00:06:28.310> really<00:06:28.490> like<00:06:28.669> this<00:06:28.850> one

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
elixir and I really really like this one

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.990 
elixir and I really really like this one
it's<00:06:29.930> really<00:06:30.050> good<00:06:30.470> for<00:06:30.680> giving<00:06:31.010> a<00:06:31.280> shine<00:06:31.580> and

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
it's really good for giving a shine and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.240 
it's really good for giving a shine and
it<00:06:32.419> also<00:06:32.630> just<00:06:32.990> helps<00:06:33.200> with<00:06:33.380> you<00:06:33.740> know<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.980> dry

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
it also just helps with you know the dry

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.780 
it also just helps with you know the dry
damaged<00:06:34.970> hair<00:06:35.000> which<00:06:35.510> I<00:06:35.720> did<00:06:36.710> have<00:06:36.979> you<00:06:37.460> know

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
damaged hair which I did have you know

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.480 
damaged hair which I did have you know
before<00:06:38.180> I've<00:06:38.300> been<00:06:38.330> chopped

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
before I've been chopped

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.280 
before I've been chopped
you<00:06:40.490> know<00:06:40.580> it<00:06:40.669> was<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.880> little<00:06:41.210> dry<00:06:41.419> it<00:06:41.870> was<00:06:41.990> kind

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
you know it was a little dry it was kind

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.440 
you know it was a little dry it was kind
of<00:06:42.320> shedding<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.830> little<00:06:43.070> bit<00:06:43.250> so<00:06:43.640> different

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
of shedding a little bit so different

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.150 
of shedding a little bit so different
things<00:06:44.600> were<00:06:44.720> going<00:06:44.750> on<00:06:45.169> and<00:06:45.410> so<00:06:45.560> I<00:06:45.830> really

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
things were going on and so I really

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.330 
things were going on and so I really
like<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.490> finishing<00:06:47.270> elixir<00:06:47.720> and<00:06:48.710> so<00:06:48.860> that's

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
like the finishing elixir and so that's

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.130 
like the finishing elixir and so that's
why<00:06:49.520> I<00:06:49.550> kind<00:06:49.820> of<00:06:50.030> you<00:06:50.360> know<00:06:50.479> have<00:06:50.720> it<00:06:50.750> kind<00:06:51.050> of

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
why I kind of you know have it kind of

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.500 
why I kind of you know have it kind of
in<00:06:51.229> circulation<00:06:51.770> and<00:06:52.430> then<00:06:52.850> I<00:06:52.910> also<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.360> the

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
in circulation and then I also have the

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.540 
in circulation and then I also have the
Carol's<00:06:53.840> Daughter<00:06:54.110> black<00:06:54.530> vanilla<00:06:54.650> moisture

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
it throughout the day um so I really

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.550

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.320 
like it it's good for shine as well like
I<00:07:09.710> said<00:07:09.770> these<00:07:10.100> are<00:07:10.160> kind<00:07:10.460> of<00:07:10.490> interchangeable

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
I said these are kind of interchangeable

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.300 
I said these are kind of interchangeable
this<00:07:11.750> one<00:07:11.930> I<00:07:11.960> have<00:07:12.200> on<00:07:12.229> today<00:07:12.590> and<00:07:13.100> I<00:07:13.250> don't

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
this one I have on today and I don't

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.550 
this one I have on today and I don't
smell<00:07:13.700> it<00:07:13.760> at<00:07:14.000> all<00:07:14.150> so<00:07:14.720> I<00:07:14.780> kind<00:07:15.020> of<00:07:15.080> like<00:07:15.320> that

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
smell it at all so I kind of like that

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.140 
smell it at all so I kind of like that
so<00:07:15.860> I<00:07:15.890> think<00:07:15.979> it<00:07:16.220> just<00:07:16.250> kind<00:07:16.460> of<00:07:16.550> depends<00:07:17.030> on

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
so I think it just kind of depends on

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.200 
so I think it just kind of depends on
you<00:07:17.810> know<00:07:17.930> how<00:07:17.960> my<00:07:18.229> nose<00:07:18.440> is<00:07:18.680> feeling<00:07:19.070> but<00:07:19.850> you

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
you know how my nose is feeling but you

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.780 
you know how my nose is feeling but you
know<00:07:20.300> which<00:07:20.540> one<00:07:20.840> I<00:07:20.870> use<00:07:21.290> but<00:07:21.740> I<00:07:22.010> really<00:07:22.640> like

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:22.790 
know which one I use but I really like

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.730 
know which one I use but I really like
them<00:07:22.970> I<00:07:23.120> haven't<00:07:23.419> used<00:07:23.570> them<00:07:23.690> together<00:07:23.870> so<00:07:24.470> I

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
them I haven't used them together so I

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.320 
them I haven't used them together so I
don't<00:07:25.310> know<00:07:25.400> if<00:07:25.520> that's<00:07:25.669> gonna<00:07:25.820> be<00:07:25.970> too<00:07:26.150> much

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
don't know if that's gonna be too much

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.409 
don't know if that's gonna be too much
too<00:07:26.630> greasy<00:07:26.930> in<00:07:27.410> the<00:07:27.470> heat<00:07:28.160> but<00:07:28.580> I<00:07:28.880> really<00:07:29.240> like

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
too greasy in the heat but I really like

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.719 
too greasy in the heat but I really like
these<00:07:29.570> two<00:07:29.630> as<00:07:30.080> kind<00:07:30.530> of<00:07:30.620> just<00:07:30.800> a<00:07:31.039> last<00:07:31.460> little
