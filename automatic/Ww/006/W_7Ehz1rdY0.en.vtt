00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
with a ten millimeter socket on it in my

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
with a ten millimeter socket on it in my
case<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.160> ten<00:00:56.430> millimeters<00:00:56.940> anyways<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
case it was ten millimeters anyways if I

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.000 
case it was ten millimeters anyways if I
can<00:00:57.750> find<00:00:58.020> their<00:00:58.260> measurement<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can find their measurement on it to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.569 
can find their measurement on it to
prove<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
prove it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
prove it
there<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.789> just<00:01:02.789> focus<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.629> ten

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
there it is just focus there it is ten

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.490 
there it is just focus there it is ten
millimeter

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
millimeter

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.910 
millimeter

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
nut size could be different as what she

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.179 
nut size could be different as what she
said<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.469> first<00:01:16.469> thing<00:01:16.649> you're<00:01:16.770> gonna<00:01:16.859> to<00:01:17.070> run

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
had to take off this battery cover focus

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.600 
had to take off this battery cover focus
there<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.729> go

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
there we go

this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.840> oh<00:01:30.869> three<00:01:31.319> zx5<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.219> cars<00:01:32.520> are

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
this is my oh three zx5 all cars are

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.480 
this is my oh three zx5 all cars are
fairly<00:01:33.899> similar<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.979> long<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.429> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
fairly similar as long as I have a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.699 
fairly similar as long as I have a
computer<00:01:35.959> this<00:01:36.959> probably<00:01:37.289> won't<00:01:37.409> work<00:01:37.530> on

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
computer this probably won't work on

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.590 
computer this probably won't work on
some<00:01:38.009> 1920s<00:01:38.759> Model<00:01:39.090> T<00:01:39.209> or<00:01:39.329> something<00:01:39.539> like

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
some 1920s Model T or something like

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.090 
some 1920s Model T or something like
that<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.959> they<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.859> have<00:01:41.039> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that because they really don't have a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.479 
that because they really don't have a
computer<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.840> anyways<00:01:43.189> I'm<00:01:44.189> sure

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
computer there anyways I'm sure

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.330 
computer there anyways I'm sure
somebody's<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.509> probably<00:01:46.130> Severin<00:01:47.130> tell

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
somebody's gonna probably Severin tell

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740 
somebody's gonna probably Severin tell
me<00:01:47.459> about<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.819> but<00:01:48.060> anyways<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.630> gonna

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
need to loosen up the negative battery

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.270

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
tighten it really down down tight so it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.259 
tighten it really down down tight so it
won't<00:03:28.829> come<00:03:28.920> off<00:03:29.069> on<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.280> guy<00:03:29.489> then<00:03:29.700> another

won't come off on your guy then another

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.970 
won't come off on your guy then another
thing<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.629> do<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:30.989> your<00:03:31.140> terminal<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> kind

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
thing to do is if your terminal is kind

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.660 
thing to do is if your terminal is kind
of<00:03:32.540> janky<00:03:33.540> or<00:03:33.900> really<00:03:34.799> rusty<00:03:35.159> or<00:03:35.280> something

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
