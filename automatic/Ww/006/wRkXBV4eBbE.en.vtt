think the most in the season all right
now<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.590> needed<00:02:11.799> something<00:02:12.160> special<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.850> I

now we needed something special and I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.490 
now we needed something special and I
think<00:02:13.330> he<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.630> make<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.900> difference<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
think he can make the difference in the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.370 
think he can make the difference in the
game<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.950> he<00:02:15.700> has<00:02:15.820> shown<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.049> far<00:02:17.320> in
