00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350 

well<00:01:47.350> my<00:01:47.619> frames<00:01:47.860> dropped<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.399> little<00:01:48.700> but<00:01:49.090> it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
well my frames dropped a little but it's

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.560 
well my frames dropped a little but it's
not<00:01:49.600> terribly<00:01:50.470> bad<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:51.070> mean<00:01:52.000> some<00:01:52.240> screen

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
not terribly bad I mean some screen

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.380 
not terribly bad I mean some screen
recorders<00:01:53.020> were<00:01:53.170> more<00:01:53.490> consistent<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:54.939> they

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
recorders were more consistent but they

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.160 
recorders were more consistent but they
have<00:01:55.630> less<00:01:55.930> frames<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.630> also<00:01:58.840> an

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
have less frames so this is also an
