you it's line if you keep this on a
separate<00:01:25.220> screen<00:01:25.400> with<00:01:26.060> Minecraft<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.960> can

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
separate screen with Minecraft you can

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.340 
separate screen with Minecraft you can
save<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.860> min<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.030> then<00:01:29.720> start<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.170> program

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.290 
save it min and then start the program
and<00:01:30.710> see<00:01:30.920> where<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.160> error<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.430> incorrect<00:01:31.970> on

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
and see where the error is incorrect on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.300 
and see where the error is incorrect on
this<00:01:32.450> rather<00:01:32.660> than<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.259> computer<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:34.250> mine

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
this rather than on the computer of mine

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.780 
this rather than on the computer of mine
craft<00:01:34.610> itself<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.830> it's<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:37.009> bit<00:01:37.220> hard<00:01:37.520> but

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
craft itself because it's a bit hard but

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.200 
craft itself because it's a bit hard but
this<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.509> very<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.640> program<00:01:40.880> it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
helped me to to write the the sequence

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.499 
helped me to to write the the sequence
for<00:01:46.070> for<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.729> left<00:01:46.910> as<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.090> guys<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:47.450> see
