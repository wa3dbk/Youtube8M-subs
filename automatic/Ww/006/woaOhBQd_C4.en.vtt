working on for the last two weeks this
is<00:00:08.730> jigsaw<00:00:09.420> puzzles<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.870> Minecraft<00:00:10.320> so

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
is jigsaw puzzles in Minecraft so

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
is jigsaw puzzles in Minecraft so
basically<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.179> really<00:00:12.540> just<00:00:12.660> remodeling

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
basically this is really just remodeling

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
basically this is really just remodeling
jigsaw<00:00:14.190> puzzles<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.670> their<00:00:14.910> mechanics<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
jigsaw puzzles and their mechanics and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630 
jigsaw puzzles and their mechanics and
the<00:00:15.870> concept<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.410> Minecraft<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> little

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the concept in Minecraft it's a little

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.250 
the concept in Minecraft it's a little
bit<00:00:17.760> complicated<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.630> I'll<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.900> over<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
bit complicated but I'll go over some of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.660 
bit complicated but I'll go over some of
the<00:00:19.320> mechanics<00:00:19.470> which<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.250> allow<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the mechanics which will allow you to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.359 
the mechanics which will allow you to
basically<00:00:21.270> play<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> play<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> map<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.619> start

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
basically play the play the map so start

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.410 
basically play the play the map so start
the<00:00:23.460> map<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> break<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.300> in

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the map you just have to break this in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
the map you just have to break this in
our<00:00:24.510> block<00:00:24.779> i'll<00:00:25.109> teleport<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.740> above

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
our block i'll teleport you right above

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
our block i'll teleport you right above
the<00:00:26.070> jigsaw<00:00:26.400> pieces<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.570> might<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the jigsaw pieces now this might take a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
the jigsaw pieces now this might take a
while<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.410> load<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.670> pieces<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.210> i'm

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
while to load the the pieces but i'm

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.460 
while to load the the pieces but i'm
going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> Optifine<00:00:30.990> zoom<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
going to use the Optifine zoom to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.540 
going to use the Optifine zoom to
actually<00:00:31.679> speed<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> trunk<00:00:32.250> loading

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually speed up the trunk loading

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually speed up the trunk loading
process<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.510> total<00:00:33.540> 96<00:00:34.380> puzzle

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
process there are in total 96 puzzle

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.850 
process there are in total 96 puzzle
pieces<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.510> took<00:00:36.719> me<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.230> three<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pieces so it is took me about three to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.580 
pieces so it is took me about three to
four<00:00:38.010> hours<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.790> solve<00:00:39.059> myself<00:00:39.590> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
four hours to actually solve myself and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
four hours to actually solve myself and
i'm<00:00:40.680> using<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.309> illuminati<00:00:42.000> image<00:00:42.300> i'll

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
i'm using the illuminati image i'll

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
i'm using the illuminati image i'll
leave<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.440> link<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> image<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.910> used<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this is a very large map but there are a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
this is a very large map but there are a
few<00:00:57.059> items<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.480> hotbar<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> use

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
few items in your hotbar you can use

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
few items in your hotbar you can use
this<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.340> allow<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> select<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> piece

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
this will allow you to select the piece

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
this will allow you to select the piece
if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> throw<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.309> teleport

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
if you throw this down you can teleport

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.219 
if you throw this down you can teleport
downwards<00:01:03.149> because<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.080> I'm

downwards because as you can see I'm
actually<00:01:04.350> staying<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.799> top<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> barrier<00:01:05.309> roof

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
actually staying on top of barrier roof

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.830 
actually staying on top of barrier roof
throwing<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.360> will<00:01:06.510> allow<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
throwing this down will allow you to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
throwing this down will allow you to
teleport<00:01:07.140> says<00:01:07.320> puzzle<00:01:07.560> pieces<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.490> will

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
teleport says puzzle pieces this will

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
teleport says puzzle pieces this will
teleport<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.360> puzzle<00:01:09.659> board<00:01:09.930> this

will<00:01:11.070> teleport<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> bank<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
will teleport you to the bank if you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.359 
will teleport you to the bank if you
ever<00:01:12.360> lose<00:01:12.630> any<00:01:12.869> pieces<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> process<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ever lose any pieces in the process and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.499 
ever lose any pieces in the process and
this<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.030> allow<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> view<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
this will allow you to view the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
this will allow you to view the
reference<00:01:15.750> image<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.040> actually

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
reference image but this is not actually

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
reference image but this is not actually
very<00:01:17.640> necessary<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
very necessary because I'm going to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.760 
very necessary because I'm going to
leave<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> link<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> description<00:01:19.530> anyway

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
leave a link in the description anyway

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.200 
leave a link in the description anyway
so<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.000> image

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so you can actually see the image

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.490 
so you can actually see the image
without<00:01:21.390> having<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> teleport<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
without having to teleport there all the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.950 
without having to teleport there all the
time<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.280> throw<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.640> item<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.840> can

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
time if we throw this item down you can

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
time if we throw this item down you can
teleport<00:01:25.259> straight<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.880> can

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
teleport straight down and you can

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
teleport straight down and you can
select<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> piece<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.840> use<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> spa<00:01:28.710> nakd

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
select a piece so use the spa nakd

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
you get teleported back to the puzzle
board<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> tell<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
board so you can kind of tell that it is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
board so you can kind of tell that it is
a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.380> bit<00:01:49.500> laggy<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.490 
a little bit laggy but if you have a
strong<00:01:51.390> computer<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.380> a

demonstrate a few more things if you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.590 
demonstrate a few more things if you
throw<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.850> down<00:02:33.030> you'll<00:02:33.240> get<00:02:33.360> teleported
