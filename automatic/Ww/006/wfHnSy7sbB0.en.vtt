it into an AC outlet or 12 volt plug it
up<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> car<00:00:13.830> battery<00:00:14.990> this<00:00:15.990> has<00:00:16.109> been<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
up to a car battery this has been a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.200 
up to a car battery this has been a
solid<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:17.130> charger<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:17.730> us<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.029> haven't

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
solid little charger for us we haven't

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
solid little charger for us we haven't
had<00:00:18.300> any<00:00:18.449> problems<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
had any problems with it and we use it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.800 
had any problems with it and we use it
quite<00:00:20.220> often<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> field<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.480> opposed

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
quite often out in the field as opposed

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.230 
quite often out in the field as opposed
to<00:00:21.930> plugging<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> wall<00:00:23.119> just<00:00:24.119> one

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to plugging it into the wall just one

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.730 
to plugging it into the wall just one
the<00:00:24.330> reasons<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.199> 7<00:00:25.590> amp

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the reasons for that it is a 7 amp

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
the reasons for that it is a 7 amp
charger<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> charge<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.060> bit

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
charger so it can charge a little bit

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
charger so it can charge a little bit
faster<00:00:27.630> than<00:00:27.779> most<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> 5<00:00:28.349> amp<00:00:28.560> Chargers

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
faster than most of the 5 amp Chargers

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.970 
faster than most of the 5 amp Chargers
you<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.179> size<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.980> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you see that are the same size and it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.030 
you see that are the same size and it
has<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.430> permanently<00:00:33.180> affixed<00:00:33.660> leads<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
has these permanently affixed leads to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.639 
has these permanently affixed leads to
your<00:00:35.760> car<00:00:36.000> battery<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.480> three<00:00:36.690> 12-volt<00:00:37.260> power

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

your car battery or three 12-volt power
source<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:39.210> both<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> plus<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
source that is both the plus and the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
source that is both the plus and the
minus<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.370> know<00:00:41.460> take

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
minus I would like to you know take

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.950 
minus I would like to you know take
those<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.300> even<00:00:42.450> thought<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.690> putting

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
those off I even thought about putting

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
those off I even thought about putting
my<00:00:43.140> own<00:00:43.170> plug<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.340> never<00:00:44.520> got

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
my own plug on there just never got

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.889 
my own plug on there just never got
around<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> whatever<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.629> you're<00:00:48.780> gonna

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
around to it so whatever if you're gonna

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.270 
around to it so whatever if you're gonna
use<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> plug<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> wall<00:00:49.739> sometimes

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
use it to plug into the wall sometimes

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
use it to plug into the wall sometimes
they<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.199> you're

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
they get in the way if not if you're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.569 
they get in the way if not if you're
just<00:00:52.379> dragging<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.920> around<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.430> least

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
just dragging it around you at least

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
just dragging it around you at least
know<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.120> always<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.199> 12<00:00:55.860> volt

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
know you will always have the 12 volt

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.840 
know you will always have the 12 volt
lead<00:00:56.250> z'<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.789> some<00:00:59.789> other

lead z' to you know with you some other

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
lead z' to you know with you some other
things<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.329> didn't<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
things we didn't really like about it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.140 
things we didn't really like about it
small<00:01:02.520> small<00:01:03.390> display<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> biggest

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
balancing tap so if you're gonna balance

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.320 
balancing tap so if you're gonna balance
you're<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.850> something<00:01:24.299> like

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you're gonna have to use something like

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
you're gonna have to use something like
a<00:01:24.780> passive<00:01:25.200> balancer<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.040> astro

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
a passive balancer like this astro

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.620 
a passive balancer like this astro
blinky<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.189> balance<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.119> line<00:01:30.360> with

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
blinky or you can balance in line with

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
blinky or you can balance in line with
something<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.490> Tenergy<00:01:32.490> voltage<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
something like this Tenergy voltage and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.410 
something like this Tenergy voltage and
watt<00:01:33.630> meter<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.460> would<00:01:35.640> highly<00:01:35.939> recommend

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
watt meter but we would highly recommend

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
watt meter but we would highly recommend
balancing<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.020> batteries<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.340> gonna

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
balancing your batteries if you're gonna

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.679 
balancing your batteries if you're gonna
be<00:01:38.579> charging<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.090> something<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
be charging with something like this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.330 
be charging with something like this
either<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.170> charge<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.650> another<00:01:40.890> charger

either this charge or another charger

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.359 
either this charge or another charger
that<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.479> balancing<00:01:43.049> tab<00:01:43.369> other

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that doesn't have a balancing tab other

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
that doesn't have a balancing tab other
than<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> very<00:01:44.939> solid<00:01:45.509> charger<00:01:45.869> performed

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
than that very solid charger performed

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740 
than that very solid charger performed
well<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.770> us<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> said<00:01:48.210> 10<00:01:48.450> battery

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
well for us like I said 10 battery
