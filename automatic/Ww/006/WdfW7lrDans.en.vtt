00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.769
 average min ingredients 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.109
 250 grams of diced potatoes 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 150 grams of new onions 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.960
 100 50 grams of fresh assembly 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.529
 and 150 grams of mid-sized assembly 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 30 grams of butter 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.840
 take a fairly large pan in the tt is an oil primer 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.370
 I would say that 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 in 4 tablespoons of oil and we break the potatoes 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.540
 in the thriller and ahahah potatoes 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.660
 salt lightly 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 when the potatoes are cooked 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 not completely crunchy enough soft binder &amp; lt 3 my album 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.450
 in the same pan 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.730
 add the butter 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.970
 let it melt 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.720
 it must melt not fry 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.160
 then add the onions 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.480
 the onions must be braised 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 very slowly so you lower the flame 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440
 also add a little water 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.030
 and leave 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.340
 slowly turn off the onions 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.980
 to help you cooking onions you should cover them 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.480
 here is the cooking franke form door plans that are baked and then collected 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.350
 elements considered istanbul 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 where are the potatoes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530
 in this way 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.220
 the humorists will compensate 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.540
 the potato that between the onion and vice versa 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.490
 after a quarter of an hour that I died compensated probes put back in the pan 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.690
 all 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.910
 tar is already native to the bottom 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.860
 just salt them 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.199
 I come up with a little tits 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:13.519
 I recommend using a little salt after which you begin to reach assembly 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.249
 first of all fresh assembly 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.919
 the parking attendant is distributed very well 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.109
 It is the turn of a half-pot 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.909
 we also add this cheese 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.529
 after that 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.269
 discorreremo 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 all delicacy, however 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.429
 add some parsley 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.429
 that never hurts 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.339
 and let it cook 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.629
 cook the flan 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.139
 a crust on the bottom 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.739
 since we must cocholate on the other side before re-entry for the flies in 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.739
 hand cover after which or we will put back the assembly 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.619
 succeeded in this splendid enterprise there remains nothing but the terminal of 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.789
 cook it after which in the square is our pie
