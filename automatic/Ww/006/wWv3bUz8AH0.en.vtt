ebay or something let's see what this
flame<00:01:55.720> looks<00:01:55.929> like<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:01.390> still<00:02:01.720> burning

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020

pretty<00:02:02.259> well<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.770> was<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.220> think<00:02:03.580> this<00:02:03.819> has

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
pretty well if that was I think this has

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.930 
pretty well if that was I think this has
been<00:02:04.090> about<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.069> was<00:02:06.190> three<00:02:06.520> minutes<00:02:06.640> for

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
been about well it was three minutes for

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.210 
been about well it was three minutes for
the<00:02:07.000> boiling<00:02:07.420> time<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:08.140> that's<00:02:08.740> only<00:02:08.920> maybe

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the boiling time and that's only maybe

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.809 
the boiling time and that's only maybe
an<00:02:09.399> ounce<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.849> alcohol<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.420> there<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.050> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
an ounce of alcohol in there so that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.980 
an ounce of alcohol in there so that
works<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.620> put<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
works and I can just put it out with the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.040 
works and I can just put it out with the
lid<00:02:17.200> let<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.220> cool<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.900> put<00:02:20.020> my

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
