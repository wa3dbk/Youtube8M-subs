00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to be built as more of a exercising the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
to be built as more of a exercising the
Nazis<00:01:10.830> were<00:01:10.920> doing<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.400> did<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
Nazis were doing I did use a lot of that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
Nazis were doing I did use a lot of that
kind<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> ideas<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> Bismarck<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
kind of ideas from the Bismarck on it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
kind of ideas from the Bismarck on it
which<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> why<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> quite<00:01:15.570> similar<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
which is why is quite similar and so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.899 
which is why is quite similar and so
let's<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.100> over<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.610> happened

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
the link to a description again we had

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500 
the link to a description again we had
the<00:02:14.660> USS<00:02:15.080> Nautilus<00:02:15.650> which<00:02:16.610> subs<00:02:16.970> really

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the USS Nautilus which subs really

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.059 
the USS Nautilus which subs really
really<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:17.900> take<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.290> long<00:02:18.470> at<00:02:18.620> all<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:18.980> if

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
really don't take that long at all so if

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.740 
really don't take that long at all so if
you<00:02:19.190> guys<00:02:19.340> ever<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.760> know<00:02:19.879> request<00:02:20.239> any<00:02:20.450> subs

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you guys ever you know request any subs

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.890 
you guys ever you know request any subs
I<00:02:21.459> think<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.549> USS<00:02:22.910> Nautilus<00:02:23.299> took<00:02:23.510> me<00:02:23.660> about

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
I think the USS Nautilus took me about

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020 
I think the USS Nautilus took me about
about<00:02:24.620> an<00:02:24.830> hour<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.099> 20<00:02:25.220> minutes<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.700> record

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
about an hour and 20 minutes to record

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.449 
about an hour and 20 minutes to record
when<00:02:26.239> normally<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.200> ships<00:02:27.410> like<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.769> type<00:02:28.129> 23

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
when normally the ships like the type 23

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.520 
when normally the ships like the type 23
what<00:02:28.970> actually<00:02:29.269> take<00:02:29.450> me<00:02:29.569> around<00:02:29.780> four<00:02:30.230> hours

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
what actually take me around four hours

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.940 
what actually take me around four hours
so<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> huge<00:02:32.410> difference<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.769> time

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so is it a huge difference in the time

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.559 
so is it a huge difference in the time
just<00:02:34.129> because<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.579> know<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.819> colors<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.329> just

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
just because you know the colors or just

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.020 
just because you know the colors or just
one<00:02:35.750> color<00:02:36.019> or<00:02:36.190> that's<00:02:37.190> usually<00:02:37.340> very<00:02:37.640> simple

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
one color or that's usually very simple

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.780 
one color or that's usually very simple
shape<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:39.230> finally<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:40.220> my<00:02:40.310> first<00:02:40.579> sub

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
shape so I finally got my first sub

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.150 
shape so I finally got my first sub
tutorial<00:02:41.239> i<00:02:41.450> have<00:02:41.900> got<00:02:42.079> another<00:02:42.290> one<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
tutorial i have got another one that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.440 
tutorial i have got another one that
your<00:02:43.280> favorite<00:02:43.549> class<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.879> still<00:02:44.120> got<00:02:44.299> that

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
your favorite class have still got that

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.210 
your favorite class have still got that
so<00:02:45.290> i'm<00:02:45.349> probably<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.069> out

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
so i'm probably going to have that out

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.009 
so i'm probably going to have that out
in<00:02:46.430> december<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.360> work<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.780> bigger

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
in december and work on a bigger

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.630 
in december and work on a bigger
tutorial<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.650> give<00:02:48.890> me<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.400> bit<00:02:49.519> extra

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
tutorial so give me a little bit extra

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.690 
tutorial so give me a little bit extra
breathing<00:02:50.090> space<00:02:50.329> with<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:52.430> near

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
breathing space with that and then near

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.729 
breathing space with that and then near
the<00:02:52.730> end<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.060> month<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.359> had<00:02:53.510> c-17<00:02:54.379> which<00:02:54.590> i

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
the end of the month we had c-17 which i

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.259 
the end of the month we had c-17 which i
reckon<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.250> probably<00:02:55.489> one<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.640> my<00:02:55.700> best<00:02:55.910> planes

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
reckon is probably one of my best planes

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.449 
reckon is probably one of my best planes
and<00:02:56.709> hopefully<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.739> guys<00:02:57.859> didn't<00:02:58.099> get<00:02:58.190> stuck

with a tutorial the wings are really

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.800 
with a tutorial the wings are really
really<00:03:00.200> complicated<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.609> chod<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.420> figure<00:03:02.690> out

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
really complicated I chod to figure out

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.680 
really complicated I chod to figure out
you<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.260> an<00:03:03.410> easier<00:03:03.709> way<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:04.180> go<00:03:05.180> about<00:03:05.299> that

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you know an easier way to go about that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.900 
you know an easier way to go about that
so<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.889> those<00:03:07.099> links<00:03:07.519> for<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.730> four
