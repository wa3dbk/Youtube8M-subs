00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.049
 here is a video explaining how to create 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.929
 a small container in 4th football either 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.160
 a multiple and practice if it's a little 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.160
 hard starts now 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.609
 so for the first stage of the 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.289
 realization you will need everything 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.660
 simply 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.119
 cut the bobbin into two teenagers 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.730
 high level in the middle if it's a 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 beer can and if it's a can 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.170
 coca eg soda it will be more 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.160
 more up than in the middle and there I 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.460
 so go to the mines 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.989
 so here's the serious soca it's not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.609
 serious if it's badly finished because we 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:01:00.340
 will do the finishes after that's what 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.340
 you get that, we do not need it anymore 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 then for the second step so for 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.409
 try to make some more edges 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:17.119
 right already removed a little piece that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:18.579
 over it here it is beautiful and it is 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.380
 all clean 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:28.520
 then you will have to cut into the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:32.500
 bobbin strips this way with 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:38.000
 a department that is about 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:40.159
 this one you do strips like that 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.310
 all along it is what will you 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.890
 take the most time then the trick 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:52.070
 bass and two each time do them 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.130
 climb the climbs in galÃ¨re to poupet and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.939
 it will be less dangerous 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.939
 if you ever do not care 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.130
 so here is what you get after 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.670
 have done all the necessary bands 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.730
 here is a simpler moment it will you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.750
 suffice to ensure that all 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.770
 banks are pretty much the same 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:42.060
 size so cut a little bit what 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:46.970
 exceeds for banks to be of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.970
 the same size so that's pretty much 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:55.130
 do not forget to remove the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 impurities 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.730
 mine is more or less successful 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.510
 now here is the continuation and end of this 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.070
 tutorial you take a tape anywhere 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:21.230
 which you fold on itself 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:24.900
 and you put there the end in the hollow 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.870
 cinnamon and then you make the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.130
 same thing with the following you 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.370
 can superimpose them slightly 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.300
 this way 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.150
 that's what it gives at the end of a 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 half you can notice here that 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.010
 all the small bands are 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.070
 put and that the result for now 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:53.340
 is really funny you have the mixture 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:57.840
 between the stainless steel and the the the graphics of the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.640
 can is original outside and when 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.350
 it will be finished down you 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.209
 vairelles just like that but I finished 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.870
 shows you once again how that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.370
 market 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.100
 so you just have to take the tape 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.579
 to become the place is here in the small 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 hollow of the can is here here to see you 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.720
 the hollow in a row here to bend and 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.250
 that's all you do with all the 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.810
 teeth all bands 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.490
 you will be able to finish 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.310
 straighten the bands so 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.460
 that it is rather straight and that it 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.680
 do the most beautiful possible and when 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.169
 you think it's good that it's 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.040
 beautiful and that all the bands are good 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.320
 stuck and well your little container in 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:00.290
 bobbin is over that's what 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:03.180
 looks from above and poses 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.880
 so ends this video of people have me 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.479
 on his chain to turn on 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.120
 Youtube 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.680
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.290
 watching it me that made me very 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.180
 pleasure to do it and I hope to see your 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.180
 creations soon see you soon
