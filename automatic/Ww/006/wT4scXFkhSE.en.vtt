00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380
 pieces 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.360
 a few cherries or you can use 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.610
 strawberries 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.040
 a little coconut milk or if not 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.500
 Like you can use coconut water and a 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 good lime the juice of a lime let's go 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.760
 there we will start introducing all 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 the ingredients in the blender myself 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.630
 first I introduce the watermelon and as you see 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.970
 He cut it into small pieces 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.710
 then we will take the cherry and clear 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.080
 of course we have to take him 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.090
 first all the bone carefully by 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.370
 please no one is cut and we're going to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.070
 enter approximately five or 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.410
 six cherries that to taste then 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 we will introduce the lime juice 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.150
 I have used approximately half 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.950
 lime and then the coconut milk all 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 the ingredients are to taste ie 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.160
 the quantities are to taste and it is already 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.649
 ready everything to put it to beat we take 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.560
 then a glass and fill it with ice and 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.540
 we already have our refreshing drink 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 ready to serve and to take insurance 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.230
 that you will love although it has a color 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.090
 a bit strange because the glass is blue 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.780
 but I assure you that the taste is 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.780
 spectacular 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.640
 for the next snack we are going to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.400
 need chocolate which is used 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.590
 normally to melt some bananas 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.450
 that are quite hard a few 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.549
 almonds or you can use coconut too 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.769
 and some sticks can be made of wood or 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.480
 also plastic let's start 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.849
 cutting the outside of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.950
 bananas and then each one what 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.599
 let's go in half we're going to 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.069
 insert the stick inside the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.069
 banana but without reaching the end 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.840
 The following ingredients are the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 almonds previously crushed and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.290
 also the chocolate that I here 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.120
 I have melted the microwave very little 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.130
 time and we will put it in a glass that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.260
 have enough height we will need 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.790
 also a little bit of paper just 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.070
 so that chocolate does not get stuck 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.290
 too much on the plate and let's start 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.230
 covering with our chocolate 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.080
 bananas and remove all excess 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.240
 chocolate and we will take it with the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.160
 almonds do not worry because this 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.190
 part is quite sticky but the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.440
 result is great we will do the same with 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.690
 the other bananas and when we have it 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.520
 let's put it in the fridge or if 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.970
 you want it very cold in the freezer 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.970
 equal to this is the delicious result 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.760
 for our raspberry appetizers 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.560
 we are going to need raspberries a yogurt 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.830
 Greek 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.690
 a little bit of vanilla essence and a 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.620
 pastry bag 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.330
 We started by putting the yogurt in a bowl and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.820
 we are going to put a little essence 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.580
 vanilla this is to taste I put it 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.530
 about half a tablespoon and what 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.209
 we are going to remove very well 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.330
 when we have it, we will introduce it 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.250
 all inside a pastry bag but 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.139
 before putting it in, let's put a 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.540
 clip of these at the end of the sleeve 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.270
 pastry so that it does not run off 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.100
 everything and we're going to start introducing it 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.500
 how do I do it this way is 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.270
 pretty simple and we're going to put the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.389
 mix yogurt in the fridge so that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.700
 it's a bit cold and we can start 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.440
 fill our raspberries we can 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.360
 choose those that have the hole 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.780
 big enough for us to be like that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.780
 easier 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.080
 when we have them, we are going to introduce it 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.080
 in the freezer approximately one 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.880
 hour or an hour and a half and we're already like 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.860
 You see some of them I have put a droplet 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.300
 chocolate but good this is to taste 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.300
 and enjoy it 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.650
