are going to be relatively the same as
2k13<00:01:18.000> why<00:01:18.479> cuz<00:01:19.110> next<00:01:19.590> gen<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.790> I'm

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
2k13 why cuz next gen is here what I'm

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
2k13 why cuz next gen is here what I'm
trying<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.659> graphics<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.680> maxed<00:01:23.310> out

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
trying to say is graphics are maxed out

trying to say is graphics are maxed out
for<00:01:24.090> 2k<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> graphics<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.619> maxed<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
for 2k now the graphics are maxed out I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310 
for 2k now the graphics are maxed out I
mean<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> play<00:01:27.090> halo<00:01:27.479> you'll<00:01:27.810> notice<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
mean if you play halo you'll notice that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.929 
mean if you play halo you'll notice that
the<00:01:28.619> halo<00:01:28.799> graphics<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.579> haven't<00:01:29.909> changed

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
from Halo 3 2 halo reach and possibly

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
from Halo 3 2 halo reach and possibly
even<00:01:32.579> halo<00:01:33.000> 4<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> course<00:01:33.659> halo<00:01:34.200> 3<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> Halo<00:01:34.740> 4

even halo 4 of course halo 3 and Halo 4
is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> big<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.060> gap<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> course

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is a big time you know gap but of course

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
is a big time you know gap but of course
the<00:01:37.560> graphics<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.040> relatively<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.579> small

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the graphics are relatively the small

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
this 2k is not dumb why would they take

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.230 
this 2k is not dumb why would they take
something<00:04:30.170> out<00:04:30.290> that's<00:04:31.010> on<00:04:31.220> current-gen<00:04:31.970> and

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
something out that's on current-gen and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.020 
something out that's on current-gen and
not<00:04:32.750> put<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.320> next<00:04:33.560> gen<00:04:33.860> unless<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.880> has

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
not put it in next gen unless that has

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.540 
not put it in next gen unless that has
something<00:04:35.510> up<00:04:35.660> their<00:04:35.930> sleeves<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.800> I'm<00:04:37.100> so

gen gameplay you've got to realize them

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.580 
gen gameplay you've got to realize them
think<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:04.790> like<00:05:04.940> this<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.600> as<00:05:06.200> realistic

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
think of it like this it's as realistic

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.340 
think of it like this it's as realistic
as<00:05:06.890> possible<00:05:07.390> it's<00:05:08.390> as<00:05:08.840> realistic<00:05:09.110> as

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
as possible it's as realistic as

as possible it's as realistic as
possible<00:05:09.410> into<00:05:10.070> K<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.460> also<00:05:10.730> making<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.570> for

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
possible into K is also making it for

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.970 
possible into K is also making it for
current-gen<00:05:12.110> because<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> lot<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.620> people

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
current-gen because a lot of people

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.400 
current-gen because a lot of people
don't<00:05:13.430> have<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.730> money<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.180> afford<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:15.020> next

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410

don't have the money to afford the next
gen<00:05:15.590> systems<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:16.610> yeah<00:05:16.760> a<00:05:16.790> lot<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.090> people

the<00:05:20.240> next<00:05:20.510> gen<00:05:20.660> because<00:05:21.080> they<00:05:21.290> honestly<00:05:21.470> don't

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
the next gen because they honestly don't

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.070 
the next gen because they honestly don't
have<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.160> financial<00:05:22.520> ability<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:23.630> get<00:05:23.840> NBA

2k14 or Live 14 for the next gen and
that's<00:05:27.470> why<00:05:27.650> they're<00:05:27.770> making<00:05:28.160> one<00:05:28.280> for<00:05:28.430> the

that's why they're making one for the
current<00:05:28.760> gen<00:05:29.000> because<00:05:29.180> everybody<00:05:29.540> has<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.750> 360
