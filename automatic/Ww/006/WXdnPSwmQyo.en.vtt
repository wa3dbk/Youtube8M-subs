00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.720
 rockstar and then look at these hairs 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.090

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.970
 of time 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.530
 Carmen 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 late 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.200

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.160
 hair look at my son 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.740
 we have to fight that hair this is 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.850

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.130

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.580
 we started to wash mike horses 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 leigh 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.280
 it is important the court is important 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.810
 because they bring for example in the case of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.569
 My compadre now brings his hair 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 pegadito with the guard but the ideal is 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.159
 wash it to have a little better a 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.189
 control of the hair and manipulate it 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.520
 better at the time of passing the comb I 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.759
 I think it's like ideal 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.759
 depending on the type of hair we use a 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.100
 humectant for hair to leave 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.860
 so that it leaves for whoever leaves all the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.240
 cochambre that has the boy made 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.399
 all the talk says to go 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.420
 knowing a little the concept of 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.420
 lounge and passes 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.220
 the grace of gerona is four years ago 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.100
 the restlessness that I had as a hairdresser 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.380
 I have had my many professions 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.940
 or trades this world I've always liked already 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.100
 who sounded to me is also a stylist 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.170
 what I was looking for with this was to have a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.990
 for him 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 actually for all the people but I was going 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.120
 focused a lot for the musicians 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.800
 for the rockers you do not go to any 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.480
 hairdresser and suddenly if you have a 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.430
 concert one in the case of several 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.640
 compas musicians who come here from 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.040
 it can suddenly happen that they arrive when they arrive 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.950
 to the place and days today I want to make one such 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.270
 cut and suddenly they do it to me and everything not 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.190
 was what I expected is not always like that 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.430
 As it is, my hair was not broken 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.790
 literally and that for the goal because it starts 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.790
 for a personalized and at the end 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.890
 d 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 plus 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.150
 I think you changed from a barbershop to your 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.170
 place until the phonograph I saw it by 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.290
 perhaps open 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.569
