00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello today we are going to teach you how to do 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.570
 Corrugated paper for it only 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.400
 we will need a piece of crepe paper or 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.230
 role grace paul in this case is a 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.230
 rectangle and two chopsticks 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.130
 we will start by placing one of our 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.090
 chopsticks on one side of the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.950
 paper box 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
 and what we have to do is 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.770
 Rolling the paper very carefully 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.189
 principle will cost a little bit in the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.189
 toothpick 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.980
 we will go spinning 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.980
 Be careful of breaking the paper 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 squeezing well 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.399
 until you get to about half of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.399
 our rectangle 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 when we get to the middle we will take the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.970
 other 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.860
 stick and we'll put it in the other 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.860
 extreme and we will repeat the same process 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.890
 until you get to the middle 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 when we have already rolled the two 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.070
 sides will begin to wrinkle from the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.510
 ends up to about half the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.750
 canutillo that we have formed with a lot 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.790
 watch out 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.790
 we are crumpling you see in this way 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 all the ends until you get more or 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.680
 less towards the middle 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.310
 very carefully because the paper is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.310
 it can break 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.110
 when we have all the paper 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.830
 wrinkled we will take out very carefully 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.500
 our chopsticks 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.810
 and we will have our paper ready 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.210
 corrugated if you want to get some 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.220
 better results you can cut the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.780
 ends of the paper that you see have 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.600
 less crumpled than the part 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.280
 central and you can use it to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.980
 any kind of craft to do 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 figures or make flowers if you liked 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.430
