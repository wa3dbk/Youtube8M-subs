00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.340
 surprises we never know I'm trying to 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.290
 build a show where I have not explored all 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.800
 the ranges of emotions it is to me

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.930
 sign that allows us the end of the show 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 for smaller rooms or what 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:47.700
 intimacy is important then with a 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 full band and once the music and and the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 hardware takes over contact 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.670
 with the public that leaves room for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.670
 improvisation too I would tell you that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.369
