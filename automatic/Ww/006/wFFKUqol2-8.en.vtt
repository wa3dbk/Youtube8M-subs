00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.879
 welcome once more to this answering delivery today, dealing with a very 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.560
 interesting how to interpret the bible miguel like this very well patricia 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.980
 thank you for the opportunity to be here with you discussing other 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.910
 topics of interest to our audience to the viewer 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.960
 that's how we go one way or another we are linking programs last week 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.720
 we talked about those characteristics 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 physical that the bible has that the hard shoulder or just one more book and not 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.240
 the word of God if I believe that it was important that we make it clear 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.350
 true that the bible is not simply a control book or even another book 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.670
 more from sap iberia 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.480
 the same bible declares itself the revelation of God for man and that 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 is the key and should be nothing more than what characterized it apart from being a 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.940
 God's revelation 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.260
 we said that they have the authority of the truth that the one who is 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.600
 telling the truth 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 that he thinks wandering and what to say infallible in all the areas that he touches 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.950
 whether historical or in relation to science in spiritual matters 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.390
 what he says what 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.370
 e alludes the bible then this immigrant the infallible good I think 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.830
 that point must be emphasized the patrician because many people think that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.899
 good life 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.760
 is in everything could be 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 correct in everything he has to say in relation to the spiritual world or to the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 area of ​​faith 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.160
 but that is wrong could be locked in areas of science or 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.480
 history or from those of any other scope so that it was not the scope 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.510
 spiritual and the truth is that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.080
 historically I can not trust the hairdresser then I can not 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 trust the source of revelation and if I can not trust the source revelation 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.290
 I can not trust any of its parts is all or nothing and I do not think 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.210
 we are in that logic exercise to understand I can trust the source 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.969
 what is going 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.670
 Garcia points out spiritual teachings of wisdom 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.010
 now it is in that historical where it closed with hikes also many say 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.420
 It takes a lot of faith to believe 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.119
 see everything the bible says 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.420
 but he has asked for help and an element of faith but Saturday something when the area 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090
 men of science speak 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 of what happened million million years ago found an element of fenavi 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.359
 he was there to check that 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.579
 has been assuming that the laws of physics worked that time of the 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.530
 same way that they work today and you realize that there is an element of faith now 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.409
 I think it's important that we 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.360
 let's make the distinction true of what when the bible speaks was certain 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.629
 science ad affirmations like when it says there's in the job book 26 7 that 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.229
 God placed the earth suspended it from nothing 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.869
 that what is a science film 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.889
 it's true and that's important because in the world of science until the years 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.429
 1700 the stars were supposed to hang with a kind of cable if you want 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:53.979
 of a kind of umbrella that turned the bible always held not the 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.959
 earth is suspended from nothing 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.889
 that was true over what science signed art science science 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.730
 today's time the lie of tomorrow so it is more consistent we can not believe 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.609
 everything they tell us simply because it comes from science on the other hand miguel 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.879
 many from outside end 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.409
 that if the believers that if the Christian 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.999
 really believe what the bible says would live differently and that says so 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:19.619
 alluding perhaps teaching that they are very clear 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.339
 poon who comes to melilla on the other 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:25.339
 by mud a gaza section of people do not lie 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.339
 henao comets adultery 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:31.480
 that if he calls himself a Christian, he really believed what the Bible says 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.659
 would live otherwise says' well I'm 100% agree with that but there 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.990
 to do a work observations on this point patricia many people called 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:40.979
 Christian 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.819
 that it is not is simply in name then the standard will not come 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.299
 unfortunately still within those who have been born again out 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.889
 really are Christians there is a lot of disbelief we have to admit if the 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.489
 people will trust the fidelity of God's sovereignty on the other hand by erc 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.850
 to use another illustration 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.400
 I would also live much more confident and much calmer since if so 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 they would not have that phrase of the man who went to Christ 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.730
 with me demonized and asks him to help him then a moment given that 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.909
 use everything possible for the one who believes 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.340
 and then he says sir he created help me disbelief I think that's true 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.400
 that many people who believe proceed a lot of disbelief no one would do which he 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.090
 do not trust the horse 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.029
 in the end 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.479
 nyad miguel the hit with or life is reduced 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.479
 so you have enough c to accept 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.469
 I clarify, I think so, but that lack of faith I think is due to two 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:32.729
 things on the one hand 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.839
 the study of the word that most people do not make these relationships 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.879
 I can not trust someone I do not know through their relationship 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.110
 I do not know him, I do not know him, I do not know him, I do not experience him. 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.229
 with the bc place I have not experienced his fidelity 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.770
 and it is that relationship with him intimate and the experience of his fidelity and my life 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.939
 that I was going to have an intimate relationship with God so that I can trust 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.389
 no one can trust a god he does not know intimately
