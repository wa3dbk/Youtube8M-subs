00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
from a long time water keep everything

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.859 
from a long time water keep everything
in<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:51.920> plastic<00:01:52.340> bin<00:01:54.909> all<00:01:55.909> right<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.239> let's<00:01:56.720> go

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
in a plastic bin all right so let's go

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.899 
in a plastic bin all right so let's go
ahead<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:57.319> pull<00:01:57.590> up<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:57.890> control<00:01:58.429> panel

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
ahead and pull up the control panel

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.339 
ahead and pull up the control panel
let's<00:01:59.299> see<00:01:59.539> what<00:01:59.659> we<00:01:59.750> have<00:01:59.899> inside<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:02.259> took<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
let's see what we have inside I took the

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.710 
let's see what we have inside I took the
liberty<00:02:03.679> of<00:02:03.709> removing<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.880> wires<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.509> quick

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
liberty of removing the wires and quick

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.910 
liberty of removing the wires and quick
disconnects<00:02:06.140> from<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.289> buttons<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.860> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
disconnects from the buttons and the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.190 
disconnects from the buttons and the
five<00:02:07.340> pin<00:02:07.599> connector<00:02:08.599> from<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> joist<00:02:09.019> eight

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
five pin connector from the joist eight

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.530 
five pin connector from the joist eight
so<00:02:10.099> let's<00:02:10.280> put<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.789> side<00:02:10.849> for<00:02:11.420> them

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
so let's put this to the side for them

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.339 
so let's put this to the side for them
for<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.049> moment<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:14.780> over<00:02:15.079> what<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.260> have

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
for a moment and go over what we have

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.470 
for a moment and go over what we have
here<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.470> top<00:02:21.769> control<00:02:22.100> panel<00:02:22.519> rests<00:02:23.299> on

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
here so the top control panel rests on

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.660 
here so the top control panel rests on
top<00:02:23.660> red<00:02:24.350> bezel<00:02:24.739> let's<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:25.190> ahead<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.430> remove

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
top red bezel let's go ahead and remove

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.470 
top red bezel let's go ahead and remove
that<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.639> is<00:02:31.819> pretty<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:32.239> what<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that and this is pretty much what the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.539 
that and this is pretty much what the
inside<00:02:32.810> looks<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.170> since<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.829> remove<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> top

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
inside looks like since I remove the top

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.150 
inside looks like since I remove the top
