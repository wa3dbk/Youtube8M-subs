00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 not take a walk in the store otherwise 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.649
 not miss because finally for 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.300
 have no regrets for the price I know 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.390
 I put that in the summer the banks 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 with the outfits 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.440
 so obviously I took so I had 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.449
 the oranje 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.629
 I knew how to get the white ones 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.489
 I took the reds 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.770
 I took the green ones because 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 I have a lot of dab winter like that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.560
 for the summer and then I took the roses 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.000
 who was very very very pretty 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.700
 are beautiful 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.799
 at least I do not regret anything too much 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 pretty 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 then I think I took them 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.320
 the whole ray I found this one sees 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.939
 the rose in the same spirit as the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.939
 others with shiny balls 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 we will go to Creole this one 50 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.560
 centimes this one so that's 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.810
 really to put with my outfits 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030
 adequate if I have a green 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 I will put a green pair if I have a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.310
 neon yellow word I know I have 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 then I took this one sees the rose 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.399
 for this summer and I took the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.740
 oranges like that's it for this summer so 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.600
 I have everything that fits my daughter has 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.640
 chose this one she told me moment s'te 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.959
 please I can have them 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.519
 I found it a little ugly but I 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 had to buy 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.970
 there were little stars so she 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.580
 find it pretty so for the summer why 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.600
 not when there are evenings like 14 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.180
 july fireworks 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.350
 I allow him to put big 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.590
 earrings during the holidays 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:34.560
 of course not during school then ben 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.660
 I loved the rooms that I have 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 presented all the neon colors 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.120
 so I took in united oranje 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 I took fluo roses in plain so 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.940
 its flow to the colors does not give 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:57.090
 really the color that I see me 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.220
 this is yellow fluo and that's where I go 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.109
 was too much too pretty this one 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 with a super nice lipstick from the 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:08.280
 same color or all that makes it 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.880
 beautiful to make them a little purple 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.180
 bordeaux like that and I took 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.850
 that one and I bought those there 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.250
 yesterday it was the same form 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.680
 but precisely with its colors there and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.540
 I cracked for its forms here it is 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.540
 so I took this fact the last 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.150
 with all the fluo colors then he 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.940
 there was creative leisure so I'm 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.580
 not missing 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.570
 so I took some kinds of mother- of- pearl 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.580
 laminated like that to make 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.580
 pretty little earrings 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.970
 so here I went 2 in there 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.270
 had darkened too but I preferred 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.310
 This one must not think that I think too much 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.830
 because I'm going to regret it and I 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.840
 am going to read tour and then I took some 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.700
 butterflies I do not know what we are going to see 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.420
 like that when glitter and I 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.580

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:19.530
 here is sea theme then hobbies 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.370
 creative my daughter wanted those pearls there 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.800
 because there is hello kitty in pearls and 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.230
 at the alphabet there are big tits of 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.250

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.140
 bright there are mickey and there are 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.100
 round beads that I put a lot of that 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.460
 in the hair when I'm doing 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.830
 crazy 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.550
 so she asked me if she 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.580
 could see her 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.530

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.710
