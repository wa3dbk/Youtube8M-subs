00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.039
 hello welcome to my channel today 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.650
 I bring a new video this time it's a 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.160
 makeup and market product I hope that 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.460
 you like to start I'll use 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.800
 like tests the first one paint photo of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.960
 mac in the tone remove natural this us 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.200
 help to make the makeup last 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.900
 many more hours I used my powders 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.540
 of mac minerals confines in the tone 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.850
 spamfighter these powders are the powders 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.910
 facials and if you want you can also 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.190
 use as a shadow 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.470
 and as always I am using my 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.870
 cubalse palette in the one of 252 shades 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.860
 basically this makeup is 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.940
 using light brown tones as 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.540
 we have already advanced nothing of the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.540
 dark tone 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.900
 basically what I do is blur and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 apply a little more product this 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 it's a brick tone that I love 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.150
 They usually look almost all my 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.150
 makeups 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.770
 now I'm using my palette of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 coasts in the region a territory that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 I'm using a pretty clear tone 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 but natural and I really do not want a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.500
 too marked basin just blurred and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.500
 applied a little more products 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 again use my palette of costal 6 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.460
 the one with 252 shadows my palette 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.350
 unconditional this shadow that I'm 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.539
 using here is the same with which 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.990
 I put my eyebrows up and it seems to me that 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.450
 perfect tone for this makeup here 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.159
 it just blew and incorporated the shadows 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 with which I had previously applied 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.940
 I keep blurring, blurring 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.009
 blurring you know that the key 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.740
 for a very good makeup is to blur 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.240
 very well as long as you do not want to 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.240
 there are lines in your makeup 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.840
 and to give light to my eyelid I'm 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.110
 using my naked palette 3 of urban 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.420
 yorbandi key 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.700
 I do not really remember very well that you 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.100
 do not use and it was the juniors tone or 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.100
 limit the important thing was to use a tone 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 mate 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.090
 but I'm using a brown shadow 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.250
 mate obviously my palette of coasts of 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.920
 252 for whom will be a risk my 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.840
 constant palette but good not 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.050
 matter is quite practical I did not want 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.210
 that this area hip marked me 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 again use my revive palette 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:16.380
 my palette ruiz 1 to 3 600 I'm 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.690
 using the two lighter shades that 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.140
 there is one is mate and the other is a bit 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140
 pearly 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.810
 now I'm applying a shadow of mac 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.890
 which is called diva indicated normally 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.440
 I do not like to use golden shadow 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.860
 I only do when it is to illuminate 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.920
 the lacrimal 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.570
 and for me this part is quite complicated 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.100
 I think it's the hardest part of the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.740
 makeup I'm using a 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.440
 eyeliner cream or gel MACS 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.080
 called flowing line in a black tone that 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.280
 call black track apologize for having 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.200
 crouched his head 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.720
 the only thing I did at that moment can 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.530
 perfect the line that had already 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.530
 drawn 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.110
 now I'm using a black pen 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.870
 fp but a makeup brand 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.850
 Colombian professional this time maybe 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.359
 that the line is quite marked 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.359
 of the water 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.180
 and illuminated the lacrimal with my shadow to 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 illuminate from the palette forever and the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.969
 beast costumer and shade to illuminate 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.979
 favorite 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.259
 I do not know why reason or 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.299
 circumstance but I always forget 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.610
 and not always at home always me 

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:49.429
 forget to record the part where maquillo 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.569
 my eyelashes or the mask mask 

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:56.139
 or mascara I use the colossal 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.029

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.159
 ligature give us something I put them on 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.769
 here in the information box 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:07.430
 and at this moment I still do not have a machine 

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:09.830
 Mixed Spanish I put them on at the end 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.250
 and to make up my lips I'm 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.730
 using two lipsticks that do not 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.500

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.340

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.800
 time is the darkest lipstick and for 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.440
 illuminate the lips I'm using the

 Some lips man or in gradient that I 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.230
 I love this style very much 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.630
 and we give the final touch to our 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.710
 makeup perfecting our 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:49.010
 lips I'm simply removing the 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.960
 excess with a little concealer and end 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.760
 and so is our makeup 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.760
