00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.630 
couple of differences inside that I
think<00:01:39.150> you'll<00:01:39.270> find<00:01:39.450> interesting<00:01:40.430> about<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
think you'll find interesting about the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
think you'll find interesting about the
cockpit<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> control<00:01:42.810> mechanisms<00:01:43.320> we'll

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.630 
cockpit and the control mechanisms we'll
have<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> moment

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
have a look at that in a moment

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
have a look at that in a moment
now<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:46.079> steer<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
now just how do they steer it on the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.960 
now just how do they steer it on the
ground<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.579> nose<00:01:47.729> wheel<00:01:47.939> steering

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
ground well it's got nose wheel steering

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
ground well it's got nose wheel steering
and<00:01:48.540> we'll<00:01:49.259> check<00:01:49.470> inside<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> don't

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and we'll check inside to see I don't

oh yeah right that sky view system has
got<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> lot<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> information<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:53.040> yeah<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.670> think

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
got a lot of information on yeah I think

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
got a lot of information on yeah I think
we<00:03:54.090> probably<00:03:54.210> better<00:03:54.570> go<00:03:54.600> look<00:03:54.810> inside<00:03:54.960> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
we probably better go look inside the

we probably better go look inside the

I'd like to have some a little bit on
there<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.630> know<00:04:54.690> when<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.990> aluminum<00:04:55.380> is

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
there but you know when the aluminum is

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.530 
there but you know when the aluminum is
that<00:04:55.650> big<00:04:55.890> really<00:04:56.850> do<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.060> really<00:04:57.090> need<00:04:57.480> it

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
that big really do you really need it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.300 
that big really do you really need it
when<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.930> rather<00:04:58.110> see<00:04:58.470> well<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.160> like

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
when you rather see well this is like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.400 
when you rather see well this is like

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
sort of an instrument pod here does not

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.510 
sort of an instrument pod here does not
go<00:05:04.080> all<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.380> way<00:05:04.410> over<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> side<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:05.490> I

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
go all the way over to the side so I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.300 
go all the way over to the side so I
have<00:05:06.200> exceptional<00:05:07.200> forward<00:05:07.650> visibility<00:05:07.830> I

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
have exceptional forward visibility I

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.280 
have exceptional forward visibility I

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
could practically see the nosewheel from

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.590 
could practically see the nosewheel from
here<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.310> you're<00:05:11.490> using<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.880> yoke<00:05:12.090> system<00:05:12.480> on

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
the way the question earlier that we

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.500 
the way the question earlier that we
asked<00:05:16.890> about<00:05:16.950> does<00:05:17.610> not<00:05:17.880> have<00:05:18.060> toll<00:05:18.270> brakes
