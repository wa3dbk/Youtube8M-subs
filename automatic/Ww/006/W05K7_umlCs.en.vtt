00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that needs to be shopped out it's been

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
that needs to be shopped out it's been
sitting<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.190> while<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.640> does<00:00:47.820> light<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.270> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
sitting for a while it does light up but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
sitting for a while it does light up but
a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> mechanisms<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.879> frozen<00:00:51.149> up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a lot of the mechanisms are frozen up

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
a lot of the mechanisms are frozen up
and<00:00:51.570> stuff<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.260> you'd<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and stuff like that so you'd have to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
and stuff like that so you'd have to
shop<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.600> glass<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.879> in

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
shop it out the back glass is in

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
shop it out the back glass is in
actually<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.750> nice<00:00:57.930> shape<00:00:57.960> there's<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
actually in really nice shape there's a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.060 
actually in really nice shape there's a
little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.980> of<00:01:00.140> edge<00:01:01.140> we're<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
little bit of edge we're going on on the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
little bit of edge we're going on on the
bottom<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:04.769> few<00:01:04.979> marks

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
bottom here a little bit and a few marks

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.910 
bottom here a little bit and a few marks
here<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.890> right

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
here and there you can see one right

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390 
here and there you can see one right
there

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.220 

but<00:01:11.970> overall<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.660> in<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.990> nice<00:01:13.200> shape

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
but overall it's in pretty nice shape

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.260 
but overall it's in pretty nice shape
I'd<00:01:13.650> say<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> back<00:01:14.160> glass<00:01:14.370> is<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.760> nine<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
I'd say the back glass is at nine out of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
I'd say the back glass is at nine out of
ten<00:01:15.630> maybe<00:01:16.440> eight<00:01:16.560> point<00:01:16.980> five<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
ten maybe eight point five right in that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100 
ten maybe eight point five right in that
neighborhood<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.270> definitely<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> don't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
neighborhood it's definitely you don't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.400 
neighborhood it's definitely you don't
need<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.440> replace<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.190> nice<00:01:21.140> going<00:01:22.140> onto

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
need to replace it it's nice going onto

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.440 
need to replace it it's nice going onto
