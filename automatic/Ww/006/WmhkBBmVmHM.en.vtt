00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
a great chord to learn because it gets

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.000 
a great chord to learn because it gets
used<00:00:13.590> all<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> time

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.650 

it's<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.370> good<00:00:17.520> note<00:00:17.700> good<00:00:18.030> to<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.510> we're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it's a good note good to know so we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's a good note good to know so we're
gonna<00:00:18.750> start<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.310> some<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> tricks

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
gonna start with some of the tricks

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.340 
gonna start with some of the tricks
because<00:00:21.120> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> cord<00:00:22.200> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
because this is the the cord that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.740 
because this is the the cord that
probably<00:00:22.740> keeps<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.340> people<00:00:23.640> from<00:00:23.790> I'm

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
probably keeps a lot of people from I'm

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.600 
probably keeps a lot of people from I'm
actually<00:00:25.050> pursuing<00:00:25.410> guitar<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:26.100> further

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
actually pursuing guitar any further

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.760 
actually pursuing guitar any further
they<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.450> F<00:00:27.570> chord<00:00:27.870> especially<00:00:28.650> if

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
they get to the F chord especially if

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.180 
they get to the F chord especially if
their<00:00:28.950> guitar<00:00:29.820> has<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.570> high<00:00:30.810> action

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
their guitar has very high action

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.990 
their guitar has very high action
because<00:00:32.190> what<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> have

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
because what you have to do is you have

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
because what you have to do is you have
to<00:00:33.030> press<00:00:33.360> down<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.080> strings<00:00:34.410> at

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
to press down the first two strings at

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.370 
to press down the first two strings at
the<00:00:34.710> first<00:00:35.100> fret<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.510> 1st<00:00:36.600> fret<00:00:36.900> probably

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the first fret and the 1st fret probably

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
the first fret and the 1st fret probably
the<00:00:37.500> hardest<00:00:38.280> place<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> press<00:00:38.970> down<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the hardest place to press down all the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.299 
the hardest place to press down all the
strings<00:00:39.900> so<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.309> trick<00:00:41.580> on<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:43.770> lot<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
strings so the trick on this is a lot of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.270 
strings so the trick on this is a lot of
times<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:46.230> depends<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.739> everybody's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
times and it depends on everybody's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.640 
times and it depends on everybody's
Anatomy<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:49.080> so<00:00:49.380> it

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
Anatomy is a little bit different so it

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.840 
Anatomy is a little bit different so it
doesn't<00:00:49.950> work<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.190> everyone

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
doesn't work for everyone

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.820 
doesn't work for everyone
but<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.690> thing<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> most

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
but the thing that I had the most

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.950 
but the thing that I had the most
success<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.310> with<00:00:53.910> teaching<00:00:54.360> students<00:00:54.810> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
success with with teaching students is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770 
success with with teaching students is
to<00:00:55.950> take<00:00:56.310> the<00:00:56.550> side<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.060> finger<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.630> your

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to take the side of your finger of your

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.230 
to take the side of your finger of your
index<00:00:58.110> finger<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.430> play<00:00:59.970> on<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
index finger and actually play on the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.450 
index finger and actually play on the
side<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.630> finger<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.200> don't<00:01:02.130> sound

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
side of your finger I don't sound

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.249 
side of your finger I don't sound
strange<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.030> works<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.870> you're<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
these fingers come in a lot more

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.400 
these fingers come in a lot more
perpendicular<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:29.690> if<00:01:30.690> I'm<00:01:30.869> doing<00:01:31.050> this

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
perpendicular see if I'm doing this

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.440 
perpendicular see if I'm doing this
though<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.250> fingers<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.880> doing<00:01:33.270> this

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
if I bring my wrist around a lot of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.919 
if I bring my wrist around a lot of
times<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.819> bring<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.119> elbow<00:01:39.600> in

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
times you have to bring your elbow in

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.029 
times you have to bring your elbow in
closer<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.959> line<00:01:42.959> with<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.500> neck<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
closer to in line with the neck it's

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.100 
closer to in line with the neck it's
almost<00:01:44.190> like<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:44.550> you're<00:01:45.030> lining<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.690> this
