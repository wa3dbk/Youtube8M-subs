like Sam Acho o'brien schofield has to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
like Sam Acho o'brien schofield has to
set<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.110> edge<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.530> guys<00:02:44.740> on<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> interior<00:02:45.340> can

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820

play downhill and stop the run and look
in<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.160> secondary<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.940> think<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.270> safety<00:02:49.570> play

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
in the secondary I think the safety play

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.330 
in the secondary I think the safety play
in<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> secondary<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.470> huge<00:02:50.830> matching<00:02:51.250> up

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
in the secondary is huge matching up

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.580 
in the secondary is huge matching up
versus<00:02:51.730> those<00:02:51.850> tight<00:02:52.150> ends<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.600> San<00:02:53.020> Francisco

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
versus those tight ends of San Francisco

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050 
versus those tight ends of San Francisco
but<00:02:53.709> let's<00:02:53.890> go<00:02:54.010> inside<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.459> lab<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:54.910> how

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
but let's go inside the lab and see how

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.940 
but let's go inside the lab and see how
the<00:02:55.120> special<00:02:55.690> team<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.170> Cardinals<00:02:56.620> can

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the special team of the Cardinals can

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.540 
the special team of the Cardinals can
have<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.370> huge<00:02:57.760> impact<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.480> ballgame<00:02:59.550> the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
have a huge impact in this ballgame the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.520 
have a huge impact in this ballgame the
Cardinals<00:03:01.060> have<00:03:01.240> some<00:03:01.480> outstanding<00:03:01.690> special

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
Cardinals have some outstanding special

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.440 
Cardinals have some outstanding special
teams<00:03:02.890> unit<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.340> think<00:03:03.610> they<00:03:03.790> could<00:03:04.000> win<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
teams unit I think they could win the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.660 
teams unit I think they could win the
third<00:03:04.690> aspect<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> game<00:03:05.680> vs.<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.489> San

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
this one close as most divisional games

this one close as most divisional games
are<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.560> when<00:04:56.710> i<00:04:56.740> look<00:04:56.920> at<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> 49ers

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
are but when i look at the 49ers

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.670 
are but when i look at the 49ers
offensively<00:04:58.240> i<00:04:58.330> think<00:04:58.660> they<00:04:58.750> do<00:04:58.810> have<00:04:59.230> the

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
offensively i think they do have the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.350 
offensively i think they do have the
ability<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.280> get<00:05:00.550> big<00:05:00.760> plays<00:05:00.970> in<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.210> passing

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
ability to get big plays in the passing
