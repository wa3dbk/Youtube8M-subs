is<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> little<00:01:40.280> scary<00:01:40.400> but<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:42.110> know<00:01:42.230> it's<00:01:42.440> just

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
is a little scary but you know it's just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.530 
is a little scary but you know it's just
it's<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.310> compared<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.790> learning<00:01:44.150> how<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.300> jump

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
it's I compared to learning how to jump

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.490 
it's I compared to learning how to jump
at<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.720> first<00:01:44.780> time<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.140> know<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.290> first

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
at the first time you know the first

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.320 
at the first time you know the first
time<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.220> know<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> little<00:01:46.730> jumpy<00:01:47.150> jump

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
time you know you do a little jumpy jump

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.420 
time you know you do a little jumpy jump
five<00:01:47.510> feet<00:01:47.750> then<00:01:48.080> then<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.470> go<00:01:48.590> ten<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.070> next

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
five feet then then you go ten and next

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.640 
five feet then then you go ten and next
thing<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.670> you're<00:01:49.910> doing<00:01:50.060> 30<00:01:50.540> 40<00:01:51.080> 60

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
thing you know you're doing 30 40 60

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.840 
thing you know you're doing 30 40 60
foot<00:01:51.860> triples<00:01:52.190> or<00:01:52.280> something<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.580> know<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
foot triples or something you know and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.610 
foot triples or something you know and
that's<00:01:53.360> almost<00:01:53.600> how<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.780> do<00:01:53.960> across<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.410> for

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
that's almost how I do across this for

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.170 
that's almost how I do across this for
us<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.950> know<00:01:54.980> I<00:01:55.070> mean<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:55.490> learn<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.820> hit<00:01:55.970> stuff

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
us you know I mean we learn to hit stuff

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.730

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
difficult for me I always really study

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.290 
difficult for me I always really study
them<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.209> try<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.959> pick<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.260> line<00:02:21.760> where<00:02:22.760> you

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
them and try to pick a line where you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.730 
them and try to pick a line where you
know<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.690> get<00:02:23.780> rock<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> rock<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.560> rock

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
know you can get rock to rock to rock

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.490 
know you can get rock to rock to rock
without<00:02:25.520> dropping<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.570> getting<00:02:26.840> stuck<00:02:27.200> and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
without dropping in or getting stuck and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.130 
without dropping in or getting stuck and
I<00:02:28.280> do<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:28.580> best<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.970> stick<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.510> same<00:02:29.900> line

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
I do my best to stick to that same line

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.040 
I do my best to stick to that same line
but<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:31.030> lot<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.209> smaller<00:02:32.480> rocks<00:02:32.840> are

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
but a lot of the smaller rocks are

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.090 
but a lot of the smaller rocks are
constantly<00:02:33.560> moving<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:35.650> then<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.800> becomes

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
constantly moving and then it becomes

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.229 
constantly moving and then it becomes
more<00:02:37.340> difficult<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:39.760> lot<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.880> times<00:02:41.090> you

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
more difficult and a lot of times you

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.729 
more difficult and a lot of times you
really<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.630> gotta<00:02:41.840> buckle<00:02:42.110> down<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.440> know

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.760 

if<00:02:50.720> your<00:02:50.930> own<00:02:51.020> crops<00:02:51.290> when<00:02:51.500> you're<00:02:51.620> out<00:02:51.740> there

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.920 

once<00:03:24.770> you're<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.160> lead<00:03:25.660> those<00:03:26.660> guys

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
once you're in the lead those guys

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.199
