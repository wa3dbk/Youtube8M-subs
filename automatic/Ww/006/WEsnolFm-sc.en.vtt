00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.799 
UHC traps hopefully i can help you out
here<00:00:10.620> got<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> couple<00:00:11.880> different<00:00:12.059> designs<00:00:12.570> for

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
here got a couple different designs for

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.740 
here got a couple different designs for
you<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> check<00:00:13.170> out<00:00:13.380> i<00:00:13.880> love<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> trap<00:00:15.540> i

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
you to check out i love that you trap i

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.470 
you to check out i love that you trap i
love<00:00:15.990> u<00:00:16.139> HC<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.670> feed<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> piece<00:00:18.180> but

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
love u HC this is on feed the piece but

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.310 
love u HC this is on feed the piece but
it's<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> same<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.869> really

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it's all the same so it's really really

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130 
it's all the same so it's really really
simple<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.279> vanilla<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.140> check

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
simple and I know it's vanilla so check

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.460 
simple and I know it's vanilla so check
this<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> corner<00:00:27.599> idea<00:00:27.990> where

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
this out I do like the corner idea where

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
this out I do like the corner idea where
you<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> trap<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> corner<00:00:29.699> imagine<00:00:30.210> this

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you do the trap on a corner imagine this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.240 
you do the trap on a corner imagine this
isn't<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> hillside<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.560> nearly<00:00:32.099> as

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
isn't a hillside and it's not nearly as

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.780 
isn't a hillside and it's not nearly as
deep<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.190> corner<00:00:35.640> because

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
deep so I do like the corner because

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
deep so I do like the corner because
it's<00:00:36.120> harder<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> pressure<00:00:36.960> plate<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's harder to see a pressure plate here

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's harder to see a pressure plate here
and<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.110> because

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and I don't have it there now because

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
and I don't have it there now because
it's<00:00:40.590> already<00:00:40.800> set<00:00:40.980> up<00:00:41.100> I'll<00:00:41.250> show<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.489> how

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it's already set up I'll show you how

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
it's already set up I'll show you how
it's<00:00:41.700> done<00:00:42.620> they're<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> I've<00:00:44.280> done

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it's done they're the way that I've done

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's done they're the way that I've done
it<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.140> about

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
it because the thing that I think about

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
it because the thing that I think about
traps<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> better<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.960> them

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
traps is it is better to do more of them

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.139 
traps is it is better to do more of them
very<00:00:49.649> quickly<00:00:49.980> rather<00:00:50.489> than<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.820> very

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
very quickly rather than a very

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
very quickly rather than a very
elaborate<00:00:51.750> trap<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.129> block<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.460> here

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
elaborate trap so this block right here

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
elaborate trap so this block right here
is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.199> lit<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:56.420> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is the one that's going to get lit up so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.150 
is the one that's going to get lit up so
that<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> pressure<00:00:58.920> plate

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that is going to have the pressure plate

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
that is going to have the pressure plate
on<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.399> that'll<00:00:59.850> send<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> redstone<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
on it that'll send the redstone to the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
on it that'll send the redstone to the
other<00:01:01.260> piston<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.010> right<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.460> here

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
other piston that's right down here

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.960 
other piston that's right down here
because<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> only<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:05.129> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
because if you only do one it's really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
because if you only do one it's really
easy<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.780> avoid<00:01:07.320> falling<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> lava

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
easy to avoid falling down into the lava

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.770 
easy to avoid falling down into the lava
below<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.299> stairs<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
below so I like to have two stairs in a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
below so I like to have two stairs in a
row<00:01:13.020> myself<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> make

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
row myself and then you want to make

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
row myself and then you want to make
sure<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:16.080> two<00:01:16.320> rows<00:01:16.530> back

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
sure that there's a like two rows back

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.109 
sure that there's a like two rows back
here<00:01:17.009> before<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> lava<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.030> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
here before you put the lava in you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.179 
here before you put the lava in you
might<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> test<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> quick<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> then

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
might want to test it quick and then

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
might want to test it quick and then
once<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:20.610> sure<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> works<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.540> sure

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
once you're sure that it works make sure

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
once you're sure that it works make sure
there's<00:01:21.840> still<00:01:22.080> space<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there's still space because so the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.810 
there's still space because so the
Pistons<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.700> push<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.520> test

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
Pistons can push and then you can test

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
Pistons can push and then you can test
it<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.080> I'm<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.290> creative<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.829> I'll<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:28.950> test

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it out I'm on creative so I'll just test

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
it out I'm on creative so I'll just test
it<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.689> come<00:01:30.840> around<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it like this say they come around the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.609 
it like this say they come around the
corner<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:32.390> right<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.960> they're

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
corner and they right there so they're

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.840 
corner and they right there so they're
not<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.009> able<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> forward

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
not going to be able to make it forward

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
not going to be able to make it forward
to<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> next<00:01:36.180> part<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:38.009> it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
to the next part and it just it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
to the next part and it just it's
instantaneous<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:39.960> piston<00:01:40.350> goes

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
instantaneous the first piston goes

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
instantaneous the first piston goes
because<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.189> block<00:01:41.460> lights<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> then

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
because this block lights up and then

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
because this block lights up and then
the<00:01:42.840> second<00:01:43.170> piston<00:01:43.500> goes<00:01:43.649> goes<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the second piston goes goes because the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
the second piston goes goes because the
redstone<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.220> quick

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
redstone so I mean it's just that quick

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
redstone so I mean it's just that quick
there's<00:01:47.729> no<00:01:47.909> reaction<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.899> anything<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
there's no reaction time or anything so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.899 
there's no reaction time or anything so
if<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.680> land<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> block<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.909> done

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
if they land on that block they are done

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.350 
if they land on that block they are done
but<00:01:53.909> after<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> couple<00:01:54.420> times<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.960> doing<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:56.360> end

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but after a couple times of doing it end

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
but after a couple times of doing it end
up<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:58.079> losing<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.189> there's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
up not losing this one because there's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.100 
up not losing this one because there's
no<00:02:00.060> space<00:02:00.299> over<00:02:00.630> here

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
no space over here

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.350 
no space over here
so<00:02:03.110> then<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.410> then<00:02:04.160> it<00:02:04.250> works<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.120> you<00:02:05.180> want<00:02:05.300> to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
so then you then it works so you want to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.210 
so then you then it works so you want to
make<00:02:05.390> sure<00:02:05.480> this<00:02:05.660> room<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.470> having<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.920> chest

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
make sure this room and having a chest

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.340 
make sure this room and having a chest
or<00:02:07.400> something<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.880> crafting<00:02:08.360> table<00:02:08.390> within

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
or something or a crafting table within

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.320 
or something or a crafting table within
sight<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.100> case<00:02:10.430> they<00:02:10.729> come<00:02:10.759> around<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
sight in case they come around the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.630 
sight in case they come around the
corner<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.350> like<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.740> don't<00:02:13.430> know

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
corner like this and like I don't know

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.390 
corner like this and like I don't know
maybe<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.330> trapped<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.020> then<00:02:15.410> like<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
maybe this is trapped and then like the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300 
maybe this is trapped and then like the
Crouch<00:02:17.090> around<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.480> corner<00:02:17.900> oh<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.950> chest

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
Crouch around the corner oh this chest

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.720 
Crouch around the corner oh this chest
and<00:02:19.550> then<00:02:20.300> they<00:02:20.450> did<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:22.010> one<00:02:22.250> way<00:02:22.280> if

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
and then they did so that's one way if

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120 
and then they did so that's one way if
you<00:02:22.850> want<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.210> corner<00:02:23.890> yeah<00:02:24.890> there's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
you want to do a corner yeah there's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.920 
you want to do a corner yeah there's
another<00:02:25.310> way<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.760> almost<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.330> same<00:02:26.510> method

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
another way the almost the same method

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.980 
another way the almost the same method
really<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.250> straight<00:02:28.310> line<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:29.030> it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
really going in a straight line and it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.810 
really going in a straight line and it's
basically<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> same<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.430> all<00:02:31.520> set<00:02:31.790> up

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
basically the same I have it all set up

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.850 
basically the same I have it all set up
here<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:32.690> two<00:02:32.750> blocks<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> ones<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
here these two blocks are the ones that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.040 
here these two blocks are the ones that
will<00:02:34.070> go<00:02:34.190> on<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.490> set<00:02:34.730> up<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.720> don't

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
will go on this set up and you don't

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.450 
will go on this set up and you don't
really<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.470> clear<00:02:36.740> out<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> lot<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.250> space

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
really have to clear out a lot of space

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.570 
really have to clear out a lot of space
I<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:37.910> did<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.360> show<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.800> then<00:02:40.280> it's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
I just did this to show and then it's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.790 
I just did this to show and then it's
the<00:02:40.760> same<00:02:40.940> thing<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:42.170> block<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.440> going<00:02:42.740> to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
the same thing this block is going to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.190 
the same thing this block is going to
light<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:43.040> from<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.490> pressure<00:02:43.700> plate

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
light up from the pressure plate

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.740 
light up from the pressure plate
activating<00:02:45.200> both<00:02:45.410> these<00:02:45.620> pistons<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.230 

they're<00:02:50.750> coming<00:02:51.050> down<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:51.620> what<00:02:51.830> chest<00:02:52.400> now

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
they're coming down there what chest now

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.400 
they're coming down there what chest now
so<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.590> very<00:02:54.970> response<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.480> love

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
so this is very response for you I love

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.930 
so this is very response for you I love
that<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.620> try<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.890> trap<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.400> think<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.790> people

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
that you try to trap I think more people

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.440 
that you try to trap I think more people
should<00:02:59.120> trap<00:03:00.070> but<00:03:01.070> making<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.550> good<00:03:01.850> trap<00:03:02.180> is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
should trap but making a good trap is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.770 
should trap but making a good trap is
hard<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.280> usually<00:03:04.280> takes<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.670> while<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:05.090> think<00:03:05.690> a

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
hard and usually takes a while I think a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.660 
hard and usually takes a while I think a
person<00:03:05.930> could<00:03:06.230> set<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.650> in<00:03:07.100> less<00:03:07.430> than

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
person could set this up in less than

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.000 
person could set this up in less than
three<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.090> four<00:03:08.300> minutes<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.500> practiced

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
three to four minutes if they practiced

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.470 
three to four minutes if they practiced
a<00:03:10.130> little<00:03:10.220> bit<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.790> exactly<00:03:10.910> what<00:03:11.330> they

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
a little bit and do exactly what they

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.180 
a little bit and do exactly what they
needed<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.050> know<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:12.620> each<00:03:12.680> trap<00:03:13.040> you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
needed you know it for each trap you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.180 
needed you know it for each trap you
need<00:03:13.340> two<00:03:13.550> pistons<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.209> anywhere<00:03:15.140> from<00:03:15.410> five

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
need two pistons and anywhere from five

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.610 
need two pistons and anywhere from five
to<00:03:16.220> ten<00:03:16.730> redstone<00:03:17.300> depending<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.140> don't<00:03:18.530> know

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
to ten redstone depending I don't know

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.690 
to ten redstone depending I don't know
you<00:03:18.709> might<00:03:18.830> be<00:03:18.890> able<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.160> make<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> redstone

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
you might be able to make the redstone

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.060 
you might be able to make the redstone
better<00:03:20.050> please<00:03:21.050> feel<00:03:21.260> free<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.470> improve<00:03:21.830> upon

this and then you're going to need some

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.300 
this and then you're going to need some
smooth<00:03:24.019> stone<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.380> clean<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.709> after<00:03:24.890> your<00:03:25.130> done

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
so that it doesn't look like it's been

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.810 
so that it doesn't look like it's been
trapped<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.290> best<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.190> luck<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.550> in<00:03:31.730> the
