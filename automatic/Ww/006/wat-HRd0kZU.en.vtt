00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
from a lubricant and yeah the center

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.410 
from a lubricant and yeah the center
caps<00:03:23.780> used<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.200> always<00:03:24.410> fall<00:03:24.890> off<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.209> put

caps used to always fall off but I put

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.310 
caps used to always fall off but I put

the paper so I have it been and yeah the
edge<00:03:33.680> piece<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.850> pest<00:03:35.239> we<00:03:35.450> can't<00:03:35.750> mention

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
edge piece like pest we can't mention

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.979 
edge piece like pest we can't mention
ones<00:03:36.350> videos<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.940> trying<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.390> kind<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.690> curve

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
ones videos just trying to kind of curve

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.370 
ones videos just trying to kind of curve
out<00:03:39.260> right<00:03:39.920> there<00:03:40.750> which<00:03:41.750> means<00:03:41.959> its<00:03:42.170> head

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
out right there which means its head

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.970 
out right there which means its head
wear<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.799> tear<00:03:43.070> which<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.209> could<00:03:44.570> fix<00:03:44.870> i'm<00:03:45.320> too

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
wear and tear which I could fix i'm too

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.009 
wear and tear which I could fix i'm too
lazy<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.410> may<00:03:48.739> do<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.640> if<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> new

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
lazy and what I may do is if I get a new

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.440 
lazy and what I may do is if I get a new
joy<00:03:51.290> cube<00:03:51.680> I'm<00:03:51.950> going<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.220> sand<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.790> one<00:03:53.090> and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
joy cube I'm going to sand this one and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.170 
joy cube I'm going to sand this one and
see<00:03:53.959> how<00:03:53.989> good<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.860> turns<00:03:55.160> out<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.730> me<00:03:55.910> because

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
see how good it turns out to me because

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.849 
see how good it turns out to me because
I'm<00:03:56.750> afraid<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.440> mess

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
I'm afraid to mess

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:08.729 
I'm afraid to mess
even<00:03:59.859> more<00:04:02.069> but<00:04:06.180> yeah<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.659> cube<00:04:08.019> does<00:04:08.230> change

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
even more but yeah this cube does change

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.780 
even more but yeah this cube does change
a<00:04:09.249> lot<00:04:09.459> over<00:04:09.670> time<00:04:09.849> like<00:04:10.829> if<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:12.010> were<00:04:12.189> to<00:04:12.400> come

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
a lot over time like if I were to come

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.720 
a lot over time like if I were to come
up<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.209> someone<00:04:13.689> and<00:04:13.900> just<00:04:14.099> take<00:04:15.099> this<00:04:15.280> keep<00:04:15.579> up

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
up to someone and just take this keep up

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.080 
up to someone and just take this keep up
not<00:04:15.909> only<00:04:15.939> what<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.389> was<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:18.130> turn<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.759> would

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
not only what it was and turn it I would

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.449 
not only what it was and turn it I would
probably<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:20.229> under<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.799> assumption<00:04:21.310> and

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
probably be under the assumption and

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.390 
probably be under the assumption and
enjoy<00:04:21.820> cube<00:04:22.150> still<00:04:22.479> but<00:04:22.780> still<00:04:23.110> like<00:04:24.039> has<00:04:24.190> that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
enjoy cube still but still like has that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.839 
enjoy cube still but still like has that
signature<00:04:24.669> joique<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.389> peel<00:04:26.550> which<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.699> not

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
signature joique you peel which is not

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.060 
signature joique you peel which is not
as<00:04:28.000> noticeable<00:04:29.849> like<00:04:30.849> I<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:32.500> get<00:04:32.740> some<00:04:32.949> good

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
as noticeable like I can get some good

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.510 
as noticeable like I can get some good
salt<00:04:33.400> on<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.639> because<00:04:34.210> i<00:04:34.630> know<00:04:35.320> i<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:36.039> to<00:04:36.220> go

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
salt on it because i know i have to go

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.450 
salt on it because i know i have to go
slow<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:41.590> just<00:04:41.800> like<00:04:41.860> both<00:04:42.190> oscillators

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
slow it's just like both oscillators

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.909 
slow it's just like both oscillators
screws<00:04:43.240> me<00:04:43.479> out<00:04:43.630> because<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:44.320> have<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.560> go<00:04:44.710> if<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
screws me out because I have to go if I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.810 
screws me out because I have to go if I
pass<00:04:45.250> on<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:48.180> cube<00:04:49.349> but<00:04:50.349> like<00:04:50.820> fired

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
pass on that and I cube but like fired

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:22.010 
pass on that and I cube but like fired
trice<00:04:52.180> all<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:18.190> horrible<00:05:18.940> time<00:05:19.530> but<00:05:20.530> yeah<00:05:20.830> I

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
trice all the horrible time but yeah I

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.279 
trice all the horrible time but yeah I
don't<00:05:23.020> know<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.610> cube<00:05:24.909> is<00:05:25.060> still<00:05:25.419> usable<00:05:25.810> like

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
don't know the cube is still usable like

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.010 
don't know the cube is still usable like
I<00:05:26.440> still<00:05:26.740> use<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.210> but<00:05:28.210> yeah<00:05:28.419> it's<00:05:28.599> just<00:05:28.810> being

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
I still use it but yeah it's just being

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.850 
I still use it but yeah it's just being
a<00:05:29.080> mom<00:05:29.289> so<00:05:29.710> basically<00:05:31.229> still<00:05:32.229> pretty<00:05:32.680> good

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
a mom so basically still pretty good

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.570 
a mom so basically still pretty good
cute<00:05:33.220> but<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.639> does<00:05:33.849> lose<00:05:34.120> its<00:05:34.800> feel<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:36.190> guess

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
cute but it does lose its feel I guess

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.020 
cute but it does lose its feel I guess
you<00:05:36.729> could<00:05:36.789> call<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:38.490> doesn't<00:05:39.490> really

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
you could call it and doesn't really

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.570 
you could call it and doesn't really
feel<00:05:40.479> as<00:05:40.659> nice<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:41.710> brand<00:05:41.949> new<00:05:42.099> joy<00:05:42.280> keep

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
feel as nice as the brand new joy keep

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.820 
feel as nice as the brand new joy keep
obviously<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.830> cube<00:05:45.419> does<00:05:46.830> definitely

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
obviously so the cube does definitely

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.560 
obviously so the cube does definitely
lose<00:05:48.400> its<00:05:48.610> ability<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:50.520> now<00:05:51.520> would<00:05:52.030> be<00:05:52.060> rated

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
lose its ability and now would be rated

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.909 
lose its ability and now would be rated
like<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:53.909> three<00:05:54.909> out<00:05:55.060> of<00:05:55.090> ten<00:05:55.590> going<00:05:56.590> from<00:05:56.800> my

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
like a three out of ten going from my

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.360 
like a three out of ten going from my
original<00:05:57.130> rating<00:05:57.729> Omega<00:05:58.110> 1010
