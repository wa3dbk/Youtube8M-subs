 emma he was besides he must land 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.710
 the story is based on moments of my childhood a long time ago 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.780
 I also wanted to gather duty as suggested by the title of the show 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.140
 Hamada Rance It is then that comes the memory of the time I was in Madrid 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.400
 I was 16 years old I studied in Madrid alongside a great singer Guadiana 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.290
 kim accompanied for many years where they were turin and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.369
 to improve projects 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.340
 laval has deployed 1 in new york 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.500
 and it's the company with union mounts 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.190
 but for what he is he's not there yet but I'm a child of this 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.920
 attack is also based on what I experienced in Seville 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.509
 Now I have established myself for some years now 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.380
 the city remains alkala of guadaira irak me I have always been accompanied by 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.720
 concert loves me 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.640
 at the time of finalizing the show I had to rethink the profile 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.310
 and go back to one of the simplest that of the auger era sought to come up 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.540
 a company with my group sophie aulas had a word in a girl or irritates 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.799
 but the reality 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.140
 I was trying to do something classic in two years about things 

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.350
 simple and essential in flamenco the guitar singing the paloists is the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.410
 dance to know what we find on stage in this show 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:19.220
 it's the volcanic heritage it's the palm arrives is a ray why 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.690
 superman locality and jenna the eyes and the s &amp; p table so 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:24.800
 the second 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.269
 in total we worked on 24 by the years of flamenco 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.659
 that we have undertaken to sing them you will dance and 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.359
 to play 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.620
 I think this show very didactic for the general public they 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.539
 are warned or much less for vertical nets do not have 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.050
 heel chicken and kennedy york mount 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.269
 but the hardest 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.039
 a show that has conquered the flamenco planet 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.669
 from the chaillot de paris theater to miami 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.019
 going through germany and the biennale of seville 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.730
 in six first balloon paintings and his troupe have transported the audience nîmois 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.199
 by the mbaye depth of a relentless technical rigor 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.709
 integrated in a staged staged 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.109
 where light plays that are yet transitional as passages 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:05.710
 relay 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.990

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.299

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.529

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.729

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.789

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.189
 vibrate and dance 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.569
 these are these three moments as representing 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.159
 these are fragmentary costs of my childhood that I took over for this 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.359
 show and it's very nice the seniors 1 and the key in the door of a 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.590
 Hummer 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.590
