so<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> broke<00:04:20.579> them<00:04:20.820> up<00:04:20.970> three<00:04:21.269> different<00:04:21.630> ways

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
so I broke them up three different ways

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.680 
so I broke them up three different ways
I've<00:04:22.139> made<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.440> pre<00:04:22.830> chart<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:24.060> indicate<00:04:24.449> what

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
I've made a pre chart to indicate what

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.510 
I've made a pre chart to indicate what
the<00:04:24.870> various<00:04:25.229> symbols<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.949> chart<00:04:26.220> pain

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the various symbols on the chart pain

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.629 
the various symbols on the chart pain
then<00:04:27.240> there's<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.780> chart<00:04:28.050> itself<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:29.280> then

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
then there's the chart itself and then

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.120 
then there's the chart itself and then
there's<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.060> post<00:04:30.300> chart<00:04:30.780> which<00:04:31.650> gives<00:04:31.979> you

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
ideas as to look to be looking for then

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.129
