00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
team first of all you have to build your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.540 
team first of all you have to build your
team<00:01:01.040> up<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.700> then<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.780> can<00:01:03.160> versus<00:01:04.160> with<00:01:04.430> the

the<00:01:32.610> graphics<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.210> looking<00:01:33.540> excellent

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.860 

so<00:01:47.380> skills<00:01:47.950> button<00:01:48.370> has<00:01:48.610> gone<00:01:48.910> from<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.510> FIFA

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
so skills button has gone from the FIFA

00:01:49.870 --> 00:02:25.300 
so skills button has gone from the FIFA
15<00:01:49.990> game

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.940 

he's<00:02:25.850> go<00:02:26.030> away<00:02:26.209> from<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.480> defenders<00:02:26.930> here

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.470 

so<00:02:33.950> far<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.310> gameplay<00:02:34.640> seems<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.180> running

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
so far the gameplay seems to be running

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.280 
so far the gameplay seems to be running
out<00:02:35.599> on<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> g3<00:02:39.969> so<00:02:40.969> like<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> FIFA<00:02:41.629> 14<00:02:41.870> game
