Hey guys, this is Canton Ave in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania and the specialty of this street

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.499
is that it is the steepest street in the world
with a grade of 37 percent.

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.450
If you are wondering why so many people have
gathered here, they are all waiting to see

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.050
a bike race called dirty dozen where the riders
have to climb this road.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:05:00.540
Let's see if they can.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.849
As you can see, many of the professional cyclists
do make it to the top, while some of them

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.849
cannot do it.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:17.129
A few of them have even tried twice and failed
and many people do fall.

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.190
Canton Avenue simply defeats them and if it
starts snowing, it is impossible to drive

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.219
up even with your car.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:32.809
There is a lot of debate if Canton Ave is
the steepest street in the world because according

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:39.899
to Guinness book of world records, Baldwin
Street in New Zealand is listed as the steepest

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:40.899
one.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:49.120
But Baldwin Street has a grade of just 35
percent while Canton ave is in fact steeper

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.009
than that with a grade of 37 percent.

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:01.439
It is so steep that even snowplows don't drive
through to clean the street during winter.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.309
You can see that there are quite a few houses
on this street.

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:08.210
Guess what they do during winter?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.059
They all park their cars on the street below
and walk up the steps on the side.

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:20.930
This would be especially hard when they have
to carry groceries and other items to their

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.960
homes.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.270
Canton Ave is located in Beechview neighborhood
in Pittsburgh and the GPS coordinates are

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:37.960
Latitude: 40.4104043 and Longitude -80.0301259.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.999
So, if you live in Pittsburgh do check it
out.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:49.870
It is quite a challenge to drive through this
street and if you ride a bike, it gets a lot

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.870
tougher.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.449
