onto the keyboard start out by looking

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.670 
onto the keyboard start out by looking
at<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.850> metal<00:00:06.569> plates<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.080> are<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.440> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
at the metal plates that are on the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
keyboard you can see there's one on top

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.070 
keyboard you can see there's one on top
and<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> bottom<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.969> case<00:00:12.080> but

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
and two on the bottom in this case but

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
make sure to look at different keys

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.140 
make sure to look at different keys
because<00:00:14.969> they<00:00:15.389> change<00:00:15.780> position<00:00:17.090> for<00:00:18.090> example

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
because they change position for example

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.859 
because they change position for example
on<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.170> next<00:00:19.199> key<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.550> two<00:00:20.760> hooks<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
on the next key the two hooks are to the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.769 
on the next key the two hooks are to the
right<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> single<00:00:22.769> hook<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> left

bars here on the sides you can feel like
a<00:01:03.510> bump<00:01:03.930> underneath<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.299> that's<00:01:06.299> supposed<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a bump underneath and that's supposed to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.580 
a bump underneath and that's supposed to
face<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.170> keyboard<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.860> top<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.150> smooth<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
face the keyboard on top it's smooth so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.789 
face the keyboard on top it's smooth so
that<00:01:10.619> goes<00:01:11.070> facing<00:01:11.580> away<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> keyboard

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
bottom piece upside down like that by

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.840 
bottom piece upside down like that by
looking<00:01:52.780> at<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.900> bottom<00:01:53.380> bar<00:01:53.850> underneath

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
looking at the bottom bar underneath

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.380 
looking at the bottom bar underneath
there's<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.420> gap<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:57.280> want<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.670> gap<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.210> go

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
there's a gap you want that gap to go

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.640 
there's a gap you want that gap to go
facing<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.200> keyboard<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:01.420> top<00:02:01.960> it's<00:02:02.260> just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
facing the keyboard and on top it's just

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.880 
facing the keyboard and on top it's just
smooth<00:02:03.160> so<00:02:04.090> let's<00:02:04.440> put<00:02:05.440> these<00:02:05.620> two<00:02:05.860> pieces

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
smooth so let's put these two pieces

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.669 
smooth so let's put these two pieces
together<00:02:06.430> for<00:02:06.940> now

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
together for now

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.550 
together for now
place<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.920> top<00:02:09.130> bar<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.869> small<00:02:11.230> piece

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
place the top bar of the small piece

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280 
place the top bar of the small piece
underneath<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.880> top<00:02:13.150> bar<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.900> larger

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
underneath the top bar of the larger

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
underneath the top bar of the larger
piece<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.180> want<00:02:19.360> to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
piece just like that then you want to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.350 
piece just like that then you want to
put<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.170> pins<00:02:20.560> into<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.580> hole<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:27.360> push

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
put the pins into the hole you just push

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.160 
put the pins into the hole you just push
the<00:02:29.080> large<00:02:29.290> piece<00:02:30.180> away<00:02:31.180> from<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> small

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the large piece away from the small

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.380 
the large piece away from the small
piece<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.130> actually<00:02:33.280> fit<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.120> pin

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
piece so you can actually fit the pin

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.869 
piece so you can actually fit the pin
into<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.350> hole
