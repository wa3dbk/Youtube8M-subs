00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:09.060
Excuse me; can I ask you
what is love? What is love?

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.934
What is love? for me it is
'I love you'.

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.557
Love is... I don't know.

00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:13.834
Good question...

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.221
Love is very essential.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.529
I have no idea.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.262
Caring for somebody else, I suppose.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:19.142
Everything...

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:20.960
I don't really know what love is.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.642
- I don't know.
- That's a difficult one.

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:25.390
The bond between a man and a woman.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.368
Love is trust.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.080
Excuse me, can I ask you, what is love?

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:33.553
Good question.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.068
Love... I don't know, to respect one another.

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:40.125
Passion...

00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:42.451
I believe it's just merely chemical thing.

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:44.851
When you're heart is going boom, boom, boom.

00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:47.760
What is love? That's a silly question, really.

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:49.992
Harmonious integrity.

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:53.943
I suppose two people coming together...

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.616
That's a really hard question!

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.440
I wouldn't know at the moment, man.
I just got dumped by the girl I love.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.436
I'm quite in a hurry so I'll tell
you some other time.

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:08.557
Next year will be my 50th wedding
anniversary.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.799
Passion, isn't it?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.174
I'm only 21, so I wouldn't know.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.504
Love is... love.

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:15.830
I'd have to think about that.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.370
A feeling that someone can give you.

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:18.463
Sorry, I'm too busy.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.987
What is love? Wow...

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.171
It's giving of yourself.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.425
I don't know, I'm single.

00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:26.845
Can I ask you what is love?

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:29.182
Find out yourself.

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:29.950
We're just friends...

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:34.130
When two people want to share things together.

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:36.185
I have to go to work, thank you.

00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:38.424
It means a lot of things, pal.

00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:40.308
Most beautiful thing on the planet.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.571
Love?
Never heard of it.

00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:44.816
Be happy.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.545
I guess it's important.

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:49.100
- Life.
- Who knows?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.322
Self-sacrifice.

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:55.121
Something that happens, isn't it?
