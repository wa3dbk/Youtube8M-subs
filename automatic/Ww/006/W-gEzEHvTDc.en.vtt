welcome to the world of monster let's go
ahead<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.180> what<00:03:18.299> else<00:03:18.390> we<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.690> here

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
ahead and see what else we have in here

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280 
ahead and see what else we have in here
looks<00:03:21.750> like<00:03:21.840> we've<00:03:22.140> got<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.769> audio<00:03:23.549> cable<00:03:24.290> it's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
looks like we've got a audio cable it's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.240 
looks like we've got a audio cable it's
like<00:03:25.410> three-and-a-half<00:03:25.739> millimeter

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
like three-and-a-half millimeter

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.210 
like three-and-a-half millimeter
three-and-a-half<00:03:26.700> millimeter<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:29.040> think

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
three-and-a-half millimeter and I think

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.030 
three-and-a-half millimeter and I think
we've<00:03:29.340> got<00:03:29.519> another<00:03:30.090> audio<00:03:30.510> cable

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
we've got another audio cable

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.390 
we've got another audio cable
three-and-a-half<00:03:32.040> millimeter

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
three-and-a-half millimeter

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.530 
three-and-a-half millimeter
three-and-a-half<00:03:32.880> millimeter<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.420> goes

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
three-and-a-half millimeter so it goes

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.599 
three-and-a-half millimeter so it goes
it<00:03:33.780> depends<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:35.069> color<00:03:35.370> you're<00:03:35.579> looking

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
it depends on what color you're looking

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.960 
look at the headsets themselves and I'll
take<00:04:09.110> a<00:04:09.170> look<00:04:09.290> at<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.470> case<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:10.550> fold<00:04:10.820> up

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
take a look at the case they fold up

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.870 
take a look at the case they fold up
pretty<00:04:11.480> compactly<00:04:12.290> there's<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> decent<00:04:13.820> amount

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
pretty compactly there's a decent amount

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.340 
pretty compactly there's a decent amount
of<00:04:14.210> cushioning<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:14.660> can<00:04:14.810> tell<00:04:14.960> right<00:04:15.080> off<00:04:15.140> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
of cushioning I can tell right off the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.170 
of cushioning I can tell right off the
bat<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:16.130> ear<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.489> they're<00:04:16.610> not<00:04:16.730> going<00:04:16.940> to

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
bat for the ear so they're not going to

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.140 
bat for the ear so they're not going to
hurt<00:04:18.110> your<00:04:18.350> ear<00:04:18.650> these<00:04:19.280> new<00:04:19.459> offers<00:04:19.820> suppose

hurt your ear these new offers suppose

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.520 
hurt your ear these new offers suppose
the<00:04:20.270> advanced<00:04:20.540> noise<00:04:20.810> cancelling<00:04:21.320> so

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
the advanced noise cancelling so

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.980 
the advanced noise cancelling so
listening<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.040> these<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.460> an<00:04:22.580> airplane<00:04:22.990> will

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
listening to these on an airplane will

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.680 
listening to these on an airplane will
cancel<00:04:24.530> out<00:04:24.650> all<00:04:24.920> that<00:04:25.250> baby<00:04:25.610> crying<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.570> you

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.460 
immediately hear that it's keeping a lot
of<00:04:59.300> noise<00:04:59.570> out<00:04:59.660> that's<00:04:59.870> without<00:04:59.990> sort<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.380> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
of noise out that's without sort of the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.810 
of noise out that's without sort of the
noise<00:05:00.650> canceling<00:05:01.070> power<00:05:01.250> running<00:05:01.520> through<00:05:01.730> it

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
noise canceling power running through it

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.700 
noise canceling power running through it
so<00:05:02.240> I'm<00:05:02.300> very<00:05:02.480> curious<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:03.050> get<00:05:03.260> my<00:05:03.410> hands<00:05:03.650> on
