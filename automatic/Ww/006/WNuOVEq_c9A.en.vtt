00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
but I mean calorie-wise this this works

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.600 
but I mean calorie-wise this this works
for<00:03:15.300> me<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.810> find<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.190> put<00:03:17.580> a
