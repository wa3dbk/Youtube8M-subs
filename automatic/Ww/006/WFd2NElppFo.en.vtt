00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.910
 very early when we did the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.020
 first edition of the central fox day 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.460
 we realized the novelty that 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.809
 he had scored six goals Pablo Escobar 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.189
 for right-handed nchez in what was the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.800
 volley from 7 to 2 before aurora and quickly 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.140
 production as contact with our 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.119
 correspondent in the Bolivian territory 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.159
 with the golden oscar vega and with him we go 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.749
 to chat to him we are going to present for 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.599
 that obviously tells us what 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:35.600
 means this world record six goals 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.760
 in a match and of course also to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.219
 know repercussions of what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 it meant the victory of the strongest and 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.399
 the six goals scored by the forward 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.600
 let's work with him then he 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.600

 they said it today the strongest won nothing 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.200
 less than by seven goals against two is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 more leader than ever and six of those goals 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.000
 daniel pablo escobar marked them we go 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 to delve a little bit into intimacy 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.160
 of the man this afternoon because he's 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.880

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 team played well we moved away a little 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.870

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.840
 he has scored six goals in a match 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.450
 I never would have imagined but I'm 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.350
 very happy I'm happy the result 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.450
 of teamwork the team does 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.770
 everything so that we play on average 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.570
 field forward we can convert 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.940
 today it was my turn to do it in a big 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.430
 amount and I'm very happy for that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.380

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.370
 well very much though when it starts 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.870
 the championship is not my goal 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.879
 main because I'm an offensive midfielder 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 but I like to make goals and today 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.980
 be there in the table above in what 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.650

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.489
 teamwork and also thank 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 compact match give regular date 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.129
 18 of the Hernando Siles stadium tournament 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.629
 almost 15 thousand people in the stands the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.670
 Bird show started at 10 minutes 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.260
 when he put his head in front of a center 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.909
 nelvin soliz 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.720
 almost immediately with an aurora 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.760
 baffled became the second 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.020
 the team of cochabamba in which he debuted 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.300
 as a technician the argentinian marcelo 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.640
 neveleff discounted with a good free kick 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.890
 of carmelo angle however the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.630
 strongest returned to celebrate paulo daniel 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.090
 did not fail him face to face with Pablo 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.920
 he threw from the penalty spot the 4 to 1 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.500
 partial I write it down in the middle of 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.630
 I complement the steering wheel solís and escobar 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.410
 almost immediately reappeared for his 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.410
 personal room 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.540
 the juvenile baldivieso mauricio that 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.640
 Claims its call to the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.530
 U-20 selection shortened the difference to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.150
 stopped ball but fair in the middle 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.450
 the great protagonist of the meeting 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.580
 he managed the still transient 6 to 2 still 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.920
 was missing something else here is the last one of the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.560
 late moments after the coach 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240
 eduardo villegas was replaced by mauricio 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.250
 saucedo entered his place so that 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.470
 would emerge with all reason the greatest 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.010
 ovation that recorded the scenario of 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.010
 miraflores 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.060
 Pablo which of the six you liked the most 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.160
 good as the whole play was given I think 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.100
 the sixth goal was very nice the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.770
 team handled the ball well and finished 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.890
 with a nice definition of mine but each 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.440
 one has a nice flavor the dedication 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.410
 of these young people is almost obvious by 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.340
 of course the benjamin family that meets 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.610
 his first year 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.010
 and the truth is that it's a happy moment like that 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.870
 to dedicate to them a greeting to me 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.780
 family in paraguay is watching me 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.510

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.010
 family dedicated so much thank you 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.300
 thank you very much for this one 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.699
 Sanchez made six goals for Blooming in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.139
 the 87 73 and fernando morena also had 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.830
 converted seven goals in a match 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.660
 to mark a little he played 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.750
 background in addition to this amount of 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.750
