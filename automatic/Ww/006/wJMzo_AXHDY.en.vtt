00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.350
 the study tackles a glimpse at how much this new ski-doo snowmobile 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.759
 works 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:11.819
 on the critics 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.819
 we prefer not to harm the environment while breathing the air 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.179
 the new ski-doo snowmobile 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.220
 it is the reference in the industry 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 the ski-doo snowmobile emissions are lower than those of the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 competition from the point of view of hydrocarbon purchases said you know at 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.119
 carbon monoxide 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.980
 look at the level of its yamaha fate waters almost from the graph 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.000
 not only the yamaha products a lot more emissions they them 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 also send directly to the face of the driver who was behind 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.950
 on the other side the ski-doo snowmobile equipped with the rotax engine all without 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.670
 protection 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 it has a high rating of 2 10 euros 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240
 with virtually no smoke or smell 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 it allows you to enjoy the pleasure more 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.120
 bashir ahmad darty 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.149
 Rather rare that all observers expect a market 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.600
 I smoked running in November it's a huge 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.940
 gold difference according to the heavy weight balance sheet with regard to their attack especially 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.710
 symbolic and the first engine breaks it's a specially crafted by a 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.610
 snowmobile room 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.920
 the art lover for even when I did not enter very sweet but in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.650
 same high performance time 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.680
 to get the tables his missions at all without borders 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.510
 it was not necessary to sacrifice either the power or the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.820
 performance 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.729
 this reflects the extremely high degree of sophistication in 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.490
 agility 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.860
 all without fault it was designed by brp rotax and this price this special 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 mans for snowmobilers 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 each screen 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 work the polyamide components reinforced with fiberglass a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.070
 been carefully intelligently and meticulously consumed in order to create 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.390
 an engine that optimizes snowmobile performance 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 result the engine rotax all in the background the text is 730 horses 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.329
 with more low-end torque than a snowmobile that marked a couple 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.120
 higher maximum 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.590
 it means more power when you need accelerations 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.310
 faster and less revolutions to reach maximum power 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.129
 not to mention its distinctive is satisfactory the rotax engine make the 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.799
 full 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.750
 the new engine for the ski tec 12 cuissard a very nice couple at low 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:17.639
 diet 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:23.120
 the average age is incredible thanks to a power gain of 140 horsepower and for 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.259
 cause 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.299
 in the afternoon his studio activities equipped with all without bottom hit him 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.299
 to this the competition on the game plan 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.969
 at 490 pounds you can not find a lighter four-stroke snowmobile and 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:37.890
 agile 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.710
 and that's thanks in part to the new web xml platform derived from the 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.129
 ebs platform x the studio 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.030
 the csg and ds that touches the entire snowmobile season very sophisticated 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.529
 however an email 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.909
 after reaching that level behavior of the latter on the 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:53.419
 tray 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.399
 as long as it focuses the growth by far the lightest with 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.739
 better ergonomics 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.059
 the reinforcement to develop a new rear suspension 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.829
 specially designed for the engine is anything but to make this platform 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.340
 and rebel leaders 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.459
 which provides acceleration and superior maneuverability
