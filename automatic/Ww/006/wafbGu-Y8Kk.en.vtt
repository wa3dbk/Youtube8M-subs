00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
like maybe it may be getting into our

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.729 
like maybe it may be getting into our
thoughts<00:03:34.360> on<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.780> think<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> think<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
thoughts on that I think I think the

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.930 
thoughts on that I think I think the
material<00:03:36.340> must<00:03:36.700> support<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:39.640> that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
material must support the like that

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.660 
material must support the like that
approach<00:03:40.950> if<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.190> have<00:03:43.019> some<00:03:44.019> superb<00:03:45.959> just

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
approach if you have some superb just

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.330 
approach if you have some superb just
exponentially<00:03:48.670> good<00:03:49.500> material<00:03:50.500> then<00:03:50.799> okay

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
exponentially good material then okay

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340 
exponentially good material then okay
great<00:03:51.670> then<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.269> will<00:03:52.450> support<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.110> thought

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
great then it will support the thought

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.970 
great then it will support the thought
of<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.739> doing<00:03:54.100> something<00:03:54.280> extraordinary<00:03:55.980> but

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
of you doing something extraordinary but

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.250 
of you doing something extraordinary but
if<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.400> very<00:03:57.760> ordinary<00:03:58.360> material<00:03:59.019> that

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
if you have very ordinary material that

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.170 
if you have very ordinary material that
it<00:03:59.410> will<00:03:59.560> not<00:03:59.709> support<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.430> extraordinary

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
it will not support the extraordinary

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.490 
it will not support the extraordinary
approach<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.579> very<00:04:03.790> careful<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:05.380> know

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
approach so so be very careful you know

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.620 
approach so so be very careful you know
then<00:04:05.799> but<00:04:05.889> I<00:04:05.950> like

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
then but I like

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.570 
then but I like
I<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.530> good<00:04:07.680> way<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.860> separate<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
I think it's a good way to separate the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.960 
I think it's a good way to separate the
you<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:10.170> good<00:04:10.410> from<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.830> net<00:04:11.370> so<00:04:11.670> and

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
you know the good from the net so and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.550 
you know the good from the net so and
not<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.330> not<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.540> anybody<00:04:13.020> can<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.350> either

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
not it not just anybody can do it either

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.260 
not it not just anybody can do it either
like<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.160> gotta<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.000> gotta<00:04:15.150> be

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
like you know you gotta be you gotta be

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.600 
like you know you gotta be you gotta be
on<00:04:15.360> another<00:04:15.570> planet<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:16.200> be<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.280> about

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
on another planet to be like it's about

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.370 
on another planet to be like it's about
status<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.270> think<00:04:18.510> it's<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:18.840> about<00:04:19.050> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
status I think it's really about the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.229 
status I think it's really about the
material<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.310> know<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:20.520> I'm<00:04:20.640> saying<00:04:20.970> I

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
material you know what I'm saying I

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.330 
material you know what I'm saying I
really<00:04:21.870> do<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.260> don't<00:04:22.710> think<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.010> about<00:04:23.220> how

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
really do I don't think it's about how

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.700 
really do I don't think it's about how
many<00:04:23.520> records<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.970> solder<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.230> know<00:04:25.380> how

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
many records you solder you know how

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.980 
many records you solder you know how
many<00:04:25.920> followers<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.430> have<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.840> think

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
many followers you have I just think

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.280 
many followers you have I just think
it's<00:04:28.140> about<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:29.490> actually<00:04:30.020> having<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.140> kind

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
it's about you actually having the kind

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.350 
it's about you actually having the kind
of<00:04:31.410> material<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.980> will<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:33.030> know<00:04:33.150> that

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
of material that will you know that

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.460 
of material that will you know that
would<00:04:33.450> justify<00:04:33.810> such<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:36.480> conventional

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
would justify such in conventional

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.000 
would justify such in conventional
methods<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:39.450> with<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:39.990> been<00:04:40.230> said<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.710> won't

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
methods so with that been said I won't

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.670 
methods so with that been said I won't
flow<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.280> way<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.790> if<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.300> have<00:04:42.480> a<00:04:42.680> new

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
long as every time you present yourself

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.100 
long as every time you present yourself
you<00:05:27.480> do<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.810> an<00:05:27.900> amount<00:05:28.140> of<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:30.110> proper

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
you do it an amount of it is a proper

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.900 
you do it an amount of it is a proper
representation<00:05:31.500> of<00:05:32.010> what<00:05:32.160> your<00:05:32.310> movement<00:05:32.760> is

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
representation of what your movement is
