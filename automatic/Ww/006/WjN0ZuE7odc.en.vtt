00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.649
 There are several people who do it all 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.009
 wanted to comment and we know that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 but the friends bade limp epi have 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.649
 I thought I want it now 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 Just try it and you see 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.149
 her member since the first 2012 the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 the very long time are there with the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.979
 know that I have done that before 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.659
 I had that back then 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.299
 European Football Championship 2012 Spain 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.369
 against Italy the final 52 people already 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.800
 listened to it at a time where I am 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.239
 Just believe me four months 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350
 I would have to show up for four months 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.120
 youtube active 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.470
 so very good also very much fun 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.390
 I have to say honestly 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.680
 of which he would be happy if 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.330
 then listen and now now 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 even up like the whole 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.280
 works for everyone who cares 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 maybe not really imagine 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 you can just do it the normal way 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.480
 goggle to speak turns on where is coming 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.400
 zdf I do not know now where just that 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.720
 game comes i believe in zdf power 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 However, the sound of the television 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.740
 completely on quiet then you choose the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.110
 Commentator you have already 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.150
 with me and then you have the here still 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.800
 possibility if the tv picture slower 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.320
 as the commentator is easy with 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.700
 minus and plus delay means when I am 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.440
 kind of refill a bit then 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.060
 you can easily go to minus or 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.280
 plus pressure depending on that with the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.720
 Picture finally agrees there as well 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.310
 I will at the beginning of the former hlinka 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.140
 tests say I'll say then 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.550
 what I grad c and then you can do such a thing 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.600
 a little shaft man that he 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.040
 works out is a bit ahead of that one 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.990
 a little bit behind and then we get 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.820
 that baked very well what he still do 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.740
 if you have to get started then practically 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.060
 Volt is just clicking on it where 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.560
 it does not work right now where patience 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.900
 not yet and he stands there clicks her 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000
 then just on it and angeli chance 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.410
 and then I comment for you 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.820
 atlético I'm really hot 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.020
 I would of course have a few more info 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.970
 I also have to write out 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.500
 Small text is only light 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.150
 a commentator not his text 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.320
 babbles down and babbles to himself 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.090
 then you would be exactly right here 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.400
 namely as a commentator without getting 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
 Emotions paired with dangerous times 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 need that as a small info here can yes 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.590
 also be that citizen one or 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.750
 others he still does not hear me at all 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.830
 knows as youtuber so to speak but the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.120
 here just stumbled over the page 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.590
 he is a small one of that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.240
 description of me i would 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.350
 Huge happy if he is there 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.670
 I also still below in the video 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.680
 description packed the link to it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.560
 regarding a yes facebook 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.730
 event there could be times like 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.220
 to say or 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.150
 click to say so competently recite 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.030
 I do not know how it works 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.410
 because I am the organizer here now 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.210
 but here you have somewhere in the bar 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.040
 are satisfied with their simply clicks on it 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.320
 So far 44 people have attended three 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.640
 unsure who else invited so there 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.930
 I would be very happy if he was there 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.340
 that too quickly clicks so that 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.260
 just a little too much to look at 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.180
 let's see I do not even know if we are there 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.650
 theoretically crack the record 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.400
 we are a lot here then 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.500
 Max had topped 14,271 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.870
 So I hear all of them 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.120
 but actually make quite the 14,000 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 total listener 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.510
 everyone subscribes then manage it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.220
 but do that or even create it 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.199
 not clear any looks misplayed 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.280
 goes with friend or something else but how 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.479
 I definitely want to say that 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.040
 because I also reese myself 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.210
 bock on it just have the whole time 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.520
 to try and then I would say 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.110
 was that already with this one? 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.400
 small info video, however, are 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.600
 under video description as I said 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.280
 I would be glad if he got up fast 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.320
 Facebook comes along and there on 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.639
 please click or unsure if you like 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.860
 not quite so sure yet 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.560
 so that I had a big overview at the time 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.240
 and who thinks shit , it's about to happen soon 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.470
 Let's go that's how many I should be 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.210
 effort of heaven I would say 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.860
 what happens as I said with the intro 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.169
 video see you at the champions 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.660
 Leave the league final on 24 05 in the 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.860
 calendar red painting 20 o'clock 30 goes 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.449
 Let's go and we'll do some tests 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.610
 so that you all so with the picture 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.130
 hinbekommt and then we go to 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.130
