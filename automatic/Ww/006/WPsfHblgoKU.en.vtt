00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.719
 this today in the studios will be very 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.570
 interesting mod and realistic mod it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.020
 mod to add gasoline to the game is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.480
 sandra from under the minimap we notice 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.439
 such an orange strip actually 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.289
 this is a strip of your fuel which 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.290
 time spent it will have 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.590
 have to fill up at gas stations on 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 map on the map marked these refills 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.500
 but I repeat not all are marked and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 something haunts me even the cops are not on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 we hold down the n key and see English 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 fuel runs we have money 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.799
 to completely fill the tank you need only 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.650
 just some 1000 dollars is the same 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 a large amount but still dear friends 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.570
 gasoline gasoline is it expensive except 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 Venezuela gasoline penny there is so 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.180

 also glad gasoline consumed in the mission 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.770
 but in missions certainly not desirable well 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.750
 okay mission too is spent so on 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 buttons save gasoline so as not to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.479
 no fuel left the most suitable 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.439
 moment and everything will be fine so 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.770
