00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 you can 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.900
 Hello 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:28.610
 to comment to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.610
 the two goals of midfield 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.900
 or see the team better the breaks 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.580
 business 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.750
 Well, I see that where you have not earned 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.540
 has been in the area 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.970
 if the match the first 20 minutes of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.650
 our have been absolute 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.930
 last midfield dominators 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.240
 20 of the first and they have hooked 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.730
 more the ball without having opportunities 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.830
 that the goal the first goal like that an error 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.930
 important our in a horizontal pass 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.210
 that we had commented that we have 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 what to avoid 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 and that after the goal we have had 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.170
 enough opportunities to have 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.440
 neutralized the advantage even in a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.560
 triple play comes after the out 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.380
 left 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.570
 and even with 1 - we have competed until the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.130
 final or that I think the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.020
 important difference has been the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.630
 acting within the area because 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.670
 we have been, I think, remember 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.710
 five or six goal chances 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 really very significant 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.690
 It was a major inconvenience and also 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.300
 in the previous play we have also returned 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.530
 to have a double or triple opportunity 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.000
 of goal to have managed to tie a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.730
 an action in the midfield has 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 cost the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.680
 the expulsion and then have released 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.260
 already very much the party by the disadvantage in 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.880
 the marker for the numerical disadvantage and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.170
 even with everything we have continued we followed 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.270
 hitting and we had our options 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.070
 in this sense the team has been very 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.990
 honest has honored me has worked up 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.420
 until the last moment in front of a good 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.420
 team that had everything all face 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.810
 when you can enter we have 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.280
 precipitated sometimes 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.100
 in attack but I insist 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 I honestly believe that we have done 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 enough merits to not have 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.220
 lost the game I'm really saying that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.710
 the party has had its moments 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.480
 and that they have taken advantage of their 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.400
 opportunities but I want to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200
 remember that we have had at least 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.940
 five scoring opportunities with 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320
 certain with some clarity and with 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.300
 very clear arrivals until the last 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.090
 moments and there we have not resolved them is 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.000
 where the parties are decided 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.420
 be precipitation or nervousness or lack 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.880
 of quality in that last phase you can not 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.980
 take what you want but the truth 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.410
 who have been and we have not had 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.410
 luck not for the party solved either 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.110
 and I hope not right now do not talk to 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.730
 him and I do not know how he will be but good what 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.770
 important is that you have because 'we or the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 trend that has been able to culminate two 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.720
 actions more in two projections 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.150
 clear offensives of ours and we have not 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.070
 finished well but good what's important 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.050
 is that he has the chances we get 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.840
 to the area that we have the opportunities and 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.110
 come in saying we have also had that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.520
 that defensive error in the goal of eta that 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.580
 have taken advantage of perfectly in a 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.650
 fateful minute almost getting out of the way 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.980
 of the field and it has been difficult for us to react 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.300
 but then we have not succeeded and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.430
 insist once again we should 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.570
 take advantage of those opportunities and it 's 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.570
 take advantage of the climbs 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.290
 it is pain a lot of pain a lot of disappointment 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.349
 a lot of pain a lot of disappointment because it's the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.640
 another face of victory but you have to 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.470
 get up thinking about the next one 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.049
 match 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.640
 we have given everything absolutely everything not 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.959
 I have to reproach him absolutely nothing 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.250
 to my team we have followed with very good 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.830
 attitude we were able to open the scoreboard 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.360
 perfectly the first 20 minutes what 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.700
 we have done everything we have tried to do 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.170
 all for winning the game and then not 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.510
 I can not blame them absolutely 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.740
 nothing is left the pain the disappointment not 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.440
 we have been able to give joy to 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.280
 our hobby but here the fight 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.820
 continues and this has been very long and hard 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.820
 OK 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.910
 but it makes alternating movements with 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.920
 lucas instead lucas takes a lot 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.400
 area and because it brings many lucas to the area 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.969
 because it creates space is this oriol that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.679
 if not 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.209
 lucas now has several goals in 

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:17.320
 our maximum speaker and the work of 

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:19.180
 Orioles is very good for the team 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.920
 the work of their unchecks of their 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.450
 drag movements of their 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.790
 extensions have to try 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.140
 take advantage of other colleagues but I insist 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.490
 he also has his opportunities within 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.470
 of the area and has to go inside the area 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.070
 You must live the goal and reaching 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.070
 definitely 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.070
 and it's not just jazzing up inside what 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.070
 they wanted 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.540
 but as useless 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.979
 and there are many actions that we have 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.050
 prepared but we did not finish doing 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.330
 very well the movement have been done well 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.039
 the drag and so on but not here 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.259
 the ball comes in but well you have to 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.169
 keep working and looking for solutions 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.210
 in the ball stopped and then emotionally 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.270
 today it will affect us and tomorrow too 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.190
 it will affect us but on Monday afternoon 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.009
 when we start training we have to 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.870
 get up and think about the other party 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:33.110
 important it is against Almeria and 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.110
 Saturday there is no other thanks
