and<00:01:53.210> Rockstar<00:01:54.210> delayed<00:01:54.509> them<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> they

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and Rockstar delayed them so that they

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.389 
and Rockstar delayed them so that they
could<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.350> running<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.740> smoothly<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.159> possible

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
could be running as smoothly as possible

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.450 
could be running as smoothly as possible
and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.810> day<00:01:57.840> two<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.920> I
