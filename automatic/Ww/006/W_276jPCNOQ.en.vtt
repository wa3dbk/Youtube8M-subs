00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello welcome to a new video from oh 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.620
 my phone today passes through our hands the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.750
 sony xperia element 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 a perfect smartphone for users 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
 who want to economize in the purchase of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.960
 your new terminal without needing 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.150
 give up good functionalities 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 the case of the sony xperia m is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 made of plastic something that redunda 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 in which the mobile only weighs 116 grams 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 hesperia m measures have also been 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.360
 adjusted to be able to handle the terminal 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.790
 with one hand so a thickness of 9 with 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 33 millimeters and a width of 62 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 millimeters help us to get through 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 hours driving this smartphone without 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.890
 to get tired of the hesperia m screen 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.940
 it stays at 4 inches it has a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 resolution of 854 x 480 pixels and the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.570
 surface is resistant to scratches 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 we can say that without being the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.579
 full hd panel of hesperia z1 la 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 screen shows some texts 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.660
 extremely sharp vibrant colors 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.730
 and a remarkable contrast in terms of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 processor the sony xperia m incorporates a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.530
 double core manufacturer qualcomm 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 accompanied by a graph 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.729
 305 one gigabyte of ram memory 4 gb of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.200
 main storage memory that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.530
 they stay in 2 gigas for the user 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.390
 final 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.700
 this is where they are and returns to give the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 target including a slot to expand the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 memory with microsd cards up to 64 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.690
 gigas something essential for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 make the most of the mobile system 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.280
 operative that directs the set is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 Android and the living in its version 4.1 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 accompanied by some own apps of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 sony like goldman for track music and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.430
 that recognizes songs in style 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 of shazam or xperia link to send and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.259
 receive files between devices in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 general the hesperia m works in a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.970
 fluid with almost any application that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 we have tried highlighting with management 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 of social networks and messaging 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 instant in terms of the cameras the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 sony xperia m mounted the back of 5 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 megapixels incorporates flash led autofocus 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 and record high definition video at 30 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.080
 images per second on your part the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 vga quality front camera is 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.399
 intended to perform especially 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 video calls we can say that both 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.350
 objectives are within normal 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.150
 for a mid -range smartphone though 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.890
 note that the rear camera is 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.600
 it behaves much better than expected in 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.370
 dark scenes with flash and in 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.550
 outside when we have the hdr mode 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.560
 activated sony xperia connectivity 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 m is quite complete including 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 support for mobile networks hsvp to wifi 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.120
 in gps assisted dlna bluetooth radio fm 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040
 and the increasingly essential nfc a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.890
 element that is perfectly cared for 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 in this xperia m thanks to one touch a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.240
 functionality that allows us to share 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.310
 music images or videos with just one 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.780
 touch without wires 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.700
 in this section maybe we miss 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.100
 compatibility with 4g mobile networks 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 but for that we already have the hesperia esp 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.940
 in the terminal portfolio of sony la 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.360
 sony xperia m battery is removable 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.520
 reaches 1750 milliamps and is one 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.780
 of the strengths of the terminal in 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.640
 our resistance tests the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.200
 hesperia m bank endured more than one 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.510
 day and a half without the need to recharge 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.850
 thanks to sony own mode of sony 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.470
 that among other things deactivates 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.480
 notifications from the apps when the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 screen is off as final summary 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.750
 we will say that the sony xperia m is a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 smartphone that has power to spare 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.690
 to move 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.790
 messaging social networks and almost 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.800
 any other that comes to mind 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.600
 cameras meet the screen too 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.910
 highlighting the clarity of the texts and the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.250
 contrast the connectivity is remarkable 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.660
 including ene efe and also incorporates 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.470
 a battery of a range 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.470
 outstanding
