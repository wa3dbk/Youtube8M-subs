00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
gonna take this base and it's called the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.419

general<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.460> beat<00:00:11.849> puppy<00:00:12.210> soulless<00:00:13.099> so<00:00:14.099> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
general by beat puppy soulless so I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.760 
general by beat puppy soulless so I
couldn't<00:00:14.910> remember<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.599> name<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.199> wrote<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
couldn't remember the name so I wrote it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.590 
couldn't remember the name so I wrote it
to<00:00:17.220> myself<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.690> photo<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:20.330> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
to myself on the photo so this is the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.519 
to myself on the photo so this is the
base<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.640> it's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.760> pretty<00:00:23.939> easy<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
base and it's a pretty easy one for a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
base and it's a pretty easy one for a
lava<00:00:25.830> l'union<00:00:26.250> attack<00:00:26.580> especially<00:00:27.320> with

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
lava l'union attack especially with

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
lava l'union attack especially with
those<00:00:28.500> low<00:00:28.890> love<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.369> defenses<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
those low love our defenses in the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.870 
those low love our defenses in the
specific<00:00:30.960> version<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.430> take<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
specific version but you would take it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840 
specific version but you would take it
down<00:00:33.090> even<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.020> maxed<00:00:34.530> pretty<00:00:35.250> easily<00:00:35.520> as

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
down even if it maxed pretty easily as

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.479 
down even if it maxed pretty easily as
you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> clan<00:00:36.600> castle<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.460> very

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
you can see the clan castle is in a very

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.440 
you can see the clan castle is in a very
easy<00:00:39.059> location<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> queen<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
easy location and the queen is also in a

easy location and the queen is also in a
very<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.840> location<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> be

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
very easy location so it's going to be

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810 
very easy location so it's going to be
very<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.870> easy<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
very very easy to take it out so this is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.569 
very very easy to take it out so this is
the<00:00:47.910> troop<00:00:48.149> combination<00:00:48.750> i'm<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> use

the troop combination i'm going to use

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.779 
the troop combination i'm going to use
and<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.149> gonna<00:00:51.360> take<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> golem<00:00:52.280> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> clan

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.080 
and I'm gonna take a golem in the clan
castle<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.829> golem<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> use<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
castle and the golem is going to use to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.740 
castle and the golem is going to use to
take<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.230> Queen<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.250> first<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> all<00:00:59.850> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
take out the Queen so first of all you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.380 
take out the Queen so first of all you
should<00:01:00.960> notice<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.649> cannon<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> it's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
should notice that cannon and it's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
should notice that cannon and it's
outside<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.080> base<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> bad<00:01:04.830> location<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
outside the base in a bad location and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
outside the base in a bad location and
the<00:01:05.790> whole<00:01:05.939> idea<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.659> cannon<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the whole idea of this cannon is to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.090 
the whole idea of this cannon is to
interrupt<00:01:08.840> with<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.170> balloons<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> make

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
interrupt with your balloons and make

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
interrupt with your balloons and make
them<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> waste<00:01:12.090> time<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.780> I'm

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
them go there and waste time so what I'm

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
them go there and waste time so what I'm
going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> beginning<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.950> drop<00:01:14.460> one

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
going to do in the beginning is drop one

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.100 
going to do in the beginning is drop one
balloon<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> upper<00:01:16.200> part<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:18.110> one

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
balloon from the upper part and that one

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.890 
balloon from the upper part and that one
balloon<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> range<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.909> air<00:01:21.390> defenses

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
balloon is out of range of air defenses

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
balloon is out of range of air defenses
so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.159> cannon

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so it's going to take out that cannon

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.140 
so it's going to take out that cannon
very<00:01:23.880> easily<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.450> next<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> drop

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
very easily and next I'm going to drop

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.319 
very easily and next I'm going to drop
two<00:01:27.150> balloons<00:01:28.159> at<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> search<00:01:29.610> tower<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
two balloons at the search tower so I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109

can<00:01:30.570> lure<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> cloud<00:01:31.140> Castle<00:01:31.909> get<00:01:32.909> them

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

so that's another r and the whole idea

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.039 
so that's another r and the whole idea
is<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.799> you're<00:03:09.400> going<00:03:09.669> to<00:03:09.849> rage<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.750> bunch

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
is that you're going to rage this bunch

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.140 
is that you're going to rage this bunch
of<00:03:11.230> balloons<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:11.799> we're<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:12.879> in

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
of balloons which we're going to go in

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.420 
of balloons which we're going to go in
this<00:03:13.540> direction<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:14.290> all<00:03:14.829> are<00:03:15.040> going<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
this direction and all are going to be

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.960 
this direction and all are going to be
reached<00:03:15.669> for<00:03:16.180> both<00:03:16.510> air<00:03:16.780> defenses<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.370> air

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
reached for both air defenses so air

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.210 
reached for both air defenses so air
defenses<00:03:19.419> are<00:03:19.599> pretty<00:03:19.840> closed<00:03:20.229> and<00:03:20.560> you're

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
defenses are pretty closed and you're

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.699 
defenses are pretty closed and you're
going<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.549> rage<00:03:21.849> those<00:03:22.090> balloons<00:03:22.479> with<00:03:23.349> one

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
going to rage those balloons with one

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.729 
going to rage those balloons with one
rage<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:25.120> take<00:03:25.299> out<00:03:25.769> both<00:03:26.769> air<00:03:27.159> defenses<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
rage to take out both air defenses so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.809 
rage to take out both air defenses so
this<00:03:29.739> way<00:03:29.979> it's<00:03:30.129> going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.519> pretty

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
this way it's going to be pretty

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.520 
this way it's going to be pretty
effective<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:33.750> if<00:03:34.750> you're<00:03:34.959> watching<00:03:35.199> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
effective and if you're watching the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.360 
effective and if you're watching the
path<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.500> attacking<00:03:38.859> from<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
path you can see that attacking from the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.670 
path you can see that attacking from the
bottom<00:03:39.639> will<00:03:39.819> be<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> bad<00:03:40.329> idea<00:03:40.359> because<00:03:41.199> of<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
bottom will be a bad idea because of the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.050 
bottom will be a bad idea because of the
bad<00:03:42.340> path<00:03:42.729> for<00:03:43.859> your<00:03:44.859> balloons<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.909> can

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
bad path for your balloons as you can

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.099 
bad path for your balloons as you can
see<00:03:46.239> their<00:03:46.419> defenses<00:03:46.900> are<00:03:47.049> pretty<00:03:47.819> defended

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
see their defenses are pretty defended

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.920 
see their defenses are pretty defended
from<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.319> bottom<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.519> top<00:03:51.729> on<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.569> top<00:03:52.599> on

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
from the bottom on the top on the top on

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.080 
from the bottom on the top on the top on
the<00:03:52.959> other<00:03:53.169> hand<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.919> pretty<00:03:54.220> easily<00:03:54.489> they

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
the other hand it's pretty easily they

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.809 
the other hand it's pretty easily they
will<00:03:55.269> get<00:03:55.449> from<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.959> arched<00:03:56.169> our<00:03:56.819> directly

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
will get from the arched our directly

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.670 
will get from the arched our directly
into<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.629> air<00:03:58.720> defense<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.199> it's<00:03:59.349> going<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.530> be

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
into the air defense so it's going to be

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.030 
into the air defense so it's going to be
very<00:03:59.709> easy<00:04:00.129> so<00:04:00.400> sorry<00:04:00.699> for<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:01.060> big<00:04:01.209> mess<00:04:01.449> over

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
very easy so sorry for the big mess over

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.789 
very easy so sorry for the big mess over
the<00:04:03.040> drawing<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.639> hope<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.840> did<00:04:05.079> understand<00:04:05.650> it

the drawing I hope you did understand it

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.300 
the drawing I hope you did understand it
and<00:04:06.569> now<00:04:07.569> we<00:04:07.629> can<00:04:07.870> get<00:04:08.079> now<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:08.769> can<00:04:08.979> see<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
and now we can get now we can see the

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.849 
and now we can get now we can see the
attack<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:09.819> this<00:04:10.060> base<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.509> gonna<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:11.019> directly

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
attack so this base is gonna go directly

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.369 
attack so this base is gonna go directly
into<00:04:12.099> chipped<00:04:12.639> into<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.209> base<00:04:13.419> bit<00:04:13.780> section

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
into chipped into the base bit section

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.610 
into chipped into the base bit section
on<00:04:14.560> my<00:04:15.069> website<00:04:15.639> which<00:04:16.299> shows<00:04:16.630> how<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.169> beat

so this one is gonna go there it's the
first<00:04:22.270> video<00:04:22.510> I'm<00:04:22.719> doing<00:04:22.779> about<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.560> base<00:04:23.770> if

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
first video I'm doing about this base if

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.530 
first video I'm doing about this base if
you<00:04:24.159> don't<00:04:24.190> know<00:04:24.550> about<00:04:24.700> it

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540
