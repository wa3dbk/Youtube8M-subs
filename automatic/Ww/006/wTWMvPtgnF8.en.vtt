00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
feature one negative i did find out
about<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.450> tends<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> take

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
about this case is that it tends to take

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.719 
about this case is that it tends to take
a<00:01:46.110> while<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> case<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.490> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
a while to put the case back and I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.899 
a while to put the case back and I'm
correctly<00:01:48.600> either<00:01:49.470> line<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.700> wish

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
correctly either line it up and I wish

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.219 
correctly either line it up and I wish
you<00:01:51.000> were<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.390> snap<00:01:51.600> right<00:01:51.810> into<00:01:51.930> place

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you were to just snap right into place

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.929 
you were to just snap right into place
but<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.340> some<00:01:53.490> time<00:01:53.700> line

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
but you do have to take some time line

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
but you do have to take some time line
it<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.409> big<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it up but it's really not that big of a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
it up but it's really not that big of a
con<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.700> unique<00:01:56.880> feature<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.600> case

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
con one unique feature about this case

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
con one unique feature about this case
and<00:01:58.049> why<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> magnetic<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.130> strong<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and why the magnetic is so strong is you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.130 
and why the magnetic is so strong is you
could<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.270> take<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.020> just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
could just take it and you can just

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
could just take it and you can just
throw<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> any<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> metal<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
throw it on to any kind of metal and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
throw it on to any kind of metal and
it's<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> stick<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's just going to stick just like that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's just going to stick just like that
so<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.219> way<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> feature<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
so one way I like to use this feature is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
so one way I like to use this feature is
say<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.439> example<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.129> test<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.580> could

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
say for example I'm on my test I could

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
say for example I'm on my test I could
just<00:02:08.819> place<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.899> iphone<00:02:10.229> is

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
just place it and I know my iphone is

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
just place it and I know my iphone is
not<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> get<00:02:10.800> hit<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.250> damaged<00:02:11.640> while

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
not going to get hit or damaged while

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.199 
not going to get hit or damaged while
I'm<00:02:12.150> working

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
I'm working

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.490 
I'm working
overall<00:02:15.209> i'll<00:02:15.420> give<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.720> case<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> rating<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
overall i'll give this case a rating of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.869 
overall i'll give this case a rating of
five<00:02:16.739> out<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.950> five<00:02:17.069> stars<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.700> would

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
five out of five stars and I would

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.820 
five out of five stars and I would
really<00:02:18.090> recommend<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.959> has<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.709> unique

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
really recommend it it has a very unique

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.589 
really recommend it it has a very unique
feature<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> back<00:02:21.030> plate<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
feature with the back plate and the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.330 
feature with the back plate and the
Magnetic<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.530> doesn't<00:02:22.769> really<00:02:22.890> compare<00:02:23.069> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
Magnetic it doesn't really compare to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.490 
Magnetic it doesn't really compare to
any<00:02:23.459> other<00:02:23.610> case<00:02:23.879> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> market<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.780> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
any other case on the market it is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.990 
any other case on the market it is
definitely<00:02:25.709> functional<00:02:26.310> while<00:02:26.489> also<00:02:26.640> serving

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
