00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
said no one asked me to actually build

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
said no one asked me to actually build
it<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:57.750> found<00:01:57.990> something

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it it's just I actually found something

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.690 
it it's just I actually found something
for<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> lava<00:01:58.770> lake<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.280> wanted<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> build

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
for the lava lake and I wanted to build

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
for the lava lake and I wanted to build
it<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> reminded<00:02:00.750> me<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> Skyrim<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it it kind of reminded me of Skyrim and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
it it kind of reminded me of Skyrim and
I<00:02:02.040> wanted<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.270> look<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I wanted to have that kind of look the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.399 
I wanted to have that kind of look the
lava<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.770> an<00:02:05.329> additive<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.290> was

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
lava was just an additive the it was

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
lava was just an additive the it was
definitely<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.979> way<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> make<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.910> awesome

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
definitely a way to make it look awesome

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.589 
definitely a way to make it look awesome
so<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.349> able<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:12.000> animals<00:02:12.450> are

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
so I was able to do that the animals are

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.760 
so I was able to do that the animals are
awesome<00:02:13.110> i'm<00:02:13.260> trying<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> figure

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
awesome i'm trying to figure

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
awesome i'm trying to figure
what<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.520> anvils<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.150> they

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
what you can do with anvils because they

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.170 
what you can do with anvils because they
follow<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.930> laws<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> gravity<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> was<00:02:18.000> hoping

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
follow the laws of gravity I was hoping

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.480 
follow the laws of gravity I was hoping
they<00:02:18.960> would<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.800> actually<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.250> able<00:02:20.340> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
they would have them actually be able to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.660 
they would have them actually be able to
shoot<00:02:20.730> off<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.280> us<00:02:23.310> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
shoot off because you know well for us I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.790 
shoot off because you know well for us I
know<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.850> don't<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.210> if<00:02:24.690> people<00:02:24.990> do<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.410> more

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
know I don't know if people do it more

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
know I don't know if people do it more
up<00:02:25.950> north<00:02:25.980> or<00:02:26.400> more<00:02:26.580> down<00:02:26.730> south<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.270> there's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
up north or more down south but there's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
up north or more down south but there's
these<00:02:27.720> anvil<00:02:28.260> shooters<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.520> do<00:02:29.670> is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
bottom of an anvil or you put black ant

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that black powder on top of an anvil and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.720 
that black powder on top of an anvil and
then<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> put<00:02:36.540> another<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.080> top<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
then you put another on top of it and it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.000 
then you put another on top of it and it
shoots<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.050> awesome<00:02:40.320> if<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.830> could
