wide<00:00:45.270> sweep<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.830> then<00:00:47.010> we've<00:00:47.130> got<00:00:47.310> the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
wide sweep and then we've got the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.970 
wide sweep and then we've got the
rochester<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.540> whirlwind<00:00:49.080> orange<00:00:49.500> box<00:00:49.770> which

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
rochester the whirlwind orange box which

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
rochester the whirlwind orange box which
is<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.430> close<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.210> original<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.810> can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is as close to the original so you can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
is as close to the original so you can
get<00:00:52.110> designed<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> original<00:00:53.310> guys<00:00:53.430> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
get designed by the original guys that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
get designed by the original guys that
did<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.240> original<00:00:54.330> MSR<00:00:54.900> stuff<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
did the original MSR stuff and it's a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.910 
did the original MSR stuff and it's a
very<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:57.270> pedals<00:00:57.900> got<00:00:58.020> very<00:00:58.380> very<00:00:58.680> low

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
very very my pedals got very very low

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
very very my pedals got very very low
sweep<00:00:59.310> and<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.240> high<00:01:00.390> speed<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.930> well

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
sweep and very very high speed as well

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.009 
sweep and very very high speed as well
so<00:01:02.040> we've<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.310> played<00:01:02.520> through<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.820> all

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
so we've kind of played through them all

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.870 
so we've kind of played through them all
so<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.259> go

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
so here we go

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.550 
so here we go
all<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> mxr<00:01:07.170> phase<00:01:07.200> 90

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
all right and this is the mxr phase 90

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:26.740 
all right and this is the mxr phase 90
on<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> slow<00:01:08.159> speed

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:49.660 

and<00:01:28.520> do<00:01:29.520> Excel<00:01:29.880> phase<00:01:30.090> money<00:01:30.330> on<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.720> phosphate

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.210 

and<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:51.840> we've<00:01:52.050> got<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> Eric's<00:01:52.800> our<00:01:52.979> phase

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and then we've got the Eric's our phase

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:13.210 
and then we've got the Eric's our phase
90<00:01:53.429> on<00:01:53.789> slow<00:01:54.090> speed<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.569> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> script<00:01:55.080> logo

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:33.770 

and<00:02:14.330> then<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> same<00:02:15.630> again<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.260> phosphate<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
and then the same again on phosphate and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.550 
and then the same again on phosphate and
then<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> whirlwind<00:02:35.489> orange<00:02:35.940> box

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
then this is the whirlwind orange box

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:55.479 
then this is the whirlwind orange box
slow<00:02:37.560> setting

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:16.699 

and<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:57.269> that's<00:02:57.480> a<00:03:15.500> cool

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
and then that's a cool

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.410 
and then that's a cool
so<00:03:16.860> there<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.099> have<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:17.819> all<00:03:18.120> three

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
so there you have it that's all three

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.270 
so there you have it that's all three
phase<00:03:18.659> pedals<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.170> Turks<00:03:19.379> are<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
phase pedals the Turks are and the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.789 
phase pedals the Turks are and the
whirlwind<00:03:20.760> Xin<00:03:21.299> here<00:03:21.510> quite<00:03:21.780> sort<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.530> some

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
whirlwind Xin here quite sort of some

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.130 
whirlwind Xin here quite sort of some
differences<00:03:23.250> between<00:03:23.400> them<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.030> overall<00:03:24.840> all

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
differences between them but overall all

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.780 
differences between them but overall all
really<00:03:25.530> good<00:03:25.680> units<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> also<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.549> know

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
really good units and also you know

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.300 
really good units and also you know
range<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.269> crosses<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.500> playing<00:03:28.829> styles

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
range of crosses and and playing styles

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:42.510 
range of crosses and and playing styles
and<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:30.239> yeah<00:03:30.470> hope<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.560> enjoy<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.829> video<00:03:32.010> man
