00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.640
 hello to everyone 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.050
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.600
 unboxing then you know it's 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.210
 pulled out the tempestuous men militants in 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.119
 the occurrence of sion this vote allows 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.850
 to make two different units the 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.500
 squad command and myth at home temp 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.910
 sus normal it follows the exit of the astra 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.190
 minutes to rome ie what was 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 formerly the imperial guard 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.760
 so I can not exactly 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.390
 to know if it is related to the same custody 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.610
 period or if it's a different thing 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.620
 but good for me it can be associated with 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 time in addition to the gabin palco space 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.989
 Marine 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.150
 so these figurines I was taken because 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 that I find interesting more than 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.769
 continue the usual trick so in the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.989
 box as usual one to the notice of 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.339
 montage 16 years do a lot now 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.110
 to have none but they are good 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.430
 many assembly instructions especially 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.989
 for those who are multiple like 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.299
 this because as I told you we 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.549
 can do two different squads 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.920
 I do not know what I'm going 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.409
 do exactly but these figurines 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 matter not bad because you have the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.899
 normal units I would not say the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.159
 command squad but the unit that ensures 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.750
 the box in this case the helmet 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.780
 I really like it a little 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.750
 the assassin come dicaire but with a je 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 find a much prettier look and the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.109
 armor is also nice I hesitated 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.299
 a lot to do with the imperial guard 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.829
 or the equivalent of imperial guard I 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.750
 you said it to me because I 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.460
 did not find the awesome figurines 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.890
 so the base also a good course 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.719
 but these figurines there by cons I 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.460
 find it very nice and right now 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.710
 they took out a lot of things I 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.179
 I leaned over 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
 figurines herself so we'll see that 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.900
 closer 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.160
 so as you can see there I 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.650
 you zoom in on the box 1 I 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.840
 come you have pictures on the internet 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.640
 on when you can better see the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.830
 squad command is not bad especially the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.180
 captain I would finally say whoever to 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.280
 the kind of jacket but that one I know 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.450
 not if they can use it to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.270
 do a conversion I do not know yet 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.340
 in fact I think I'm not 100% sure 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.920
 but that I'm going to make you a maybe 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.360
 a little tutorial on a figurine 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.520
 basic and that the rest of the squad 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.870
 I will adapt a little to my sauce by 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.640
 compared to the oars and that I was you 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 know I was not playing that I'm not playing 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.590
 really so I'm not necessarily 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.670
 tributary to follow exactly the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.890
 rules so here I show you the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.630
 helmets closely so closed helmets 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.830
 I will not have my face and I find 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.920
 really nice I try to 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.660
 basically show you the bunch you 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.330
 look at how these figurines cds that 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.620
 are still well carved a I would have 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.390
 no time to show you one for 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.130
 to provide what it is but you have 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.800
 still a lot of pictures on the net 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.050
 which is running right now so I saw who 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.280
 also came out the codex and all that 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 you will see I was doing my few 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.570
 images after that it's the heads you 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.980
 have seen that Belgians like 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.540
 head-to-tail beret on the paper but 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.430
 after in the painting practice I 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.769
 am not necessarily a big fan of time 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.390
 to paint the skin etc you have 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.730
 the standard which is very nice I 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 will show you the other side after 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.700
 I'm trying to really show you 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.260
 big all you have on the cluster 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.489
 for you to see that a bit more 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 near 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.030
 but it is well detailed there is no 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.030
 a lot of possibilities a lot of 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.380
 combinations are weapons etc 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.720
 yes this species of montaut I you 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.220
 for the squad leader who told me 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 it's very nice I think there is 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.110
 enough to make two beautiful figurines 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.080
 on those on this weapon is there be a 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.820
 little conversion for another weapon and 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.430
 Finally, I will think on my own and 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.170
 so I'm going there you see the upside down 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.730
 of the banner that is really very 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 very pretty we can see it on the box 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.720
 behind 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.700
 it is a step that I find strong 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.350
 friendly 1,27 euro for those who me 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.840
 often ask for prices but I will 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.370
 I put the prices after this time I 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.510
 find nice and nice and it's not 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.880
 finally for me it's the rest of the guard 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.110
 imperial a little bit transformed we 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.970
 has improved 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.370
 even though they have released an associated codex 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
 etc. I think in terms of rules if 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.000
 I tell you no stupidity that can 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.660
 associate the imperial guard as well 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.310
 that at the space marines have with the rules 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.640
 to combine and so these activists 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.860
 peace situation after the imperial guard 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.930
 now has become astra milito rome 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.880
 so necessarily so there I told you 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.980
 in this box at 27 euros you can 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.919
 do either a normal squad or a 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.290
 squad as in squad so the normal 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.979
 you have that I do not have the codex 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.830
 at 38 at the post mid postan and the pran tox which 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.840
 bad to very nice but I hesitated to do 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.630
 a vehicle right now I did not know 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.400
 too much if I wanted to do that anyway 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.630
 I found a very nice vehicle I 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.180
 wanted to show you I had received that 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.860
 as I told you and it's a kit 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.710
 nice of course if you want to make a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.930
 whole army of militants post us as 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.160
 as it says I find that for 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.180
 the moment there are not 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.490
 thousands of figurines that's why 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.800
 for me I think it's very associated 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.090
 to the imperial guard I have not read 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 exactly all the stuff so some 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.270
 perhaps will comment on it in 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.289
 Anyway I hope it's a boxing 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.870
 you liked it I'll do it soon 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.010
 surely a tutorial on a simple figurine 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 I ponder for conversions 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.390
 as I told you do not hesitate to 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.580
 share to like and his games but not bad 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.639
 info on facebook and all that some 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.319
 sometimes ask me 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.849
 additional info or what I 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.710
 have not hurt on facebook so threw a 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.780
 from time to time it's not systematic I 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.129
 reply to all comments as soon as 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.449
 I can and to all the messages I 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.620
 so do not bother me 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.749
 answer etc 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.650
 unless I really do not see him 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.389
 always answer 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.490
 so I say thank you and see you soon 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.490
 for a next video cha cha
