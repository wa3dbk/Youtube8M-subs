00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
feel damaging with the 10 developer

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
feel damaging with the 10 developer
that's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.119> light<00:01:18.689> developer<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.500> it's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's a really light developer so it's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.210 
that's a really light developer so it's
not<00:01:19.710> hard<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.189> hair<00:01:20.869> um<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
not hard on your hair um you know I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
not hard on your hair um you know I
think<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> few<00:01:23.790> washes<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> will<00:01:24.689> probably

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
think with a few washes it will probably

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
think with a few washes it will probably
lighten<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.710> make<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> video<00:01:28.920> after

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
lighten up and I will make a video after

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.020 
lighten up and I will make a video after
washing<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.409> four<00:01:31.650> times<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
washing it maybe like four times just to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.859 
washing it maybe like four times just to
show<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.689> difference<00:01:34.610> but<00:01:35.869> it's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
show you the difference but it's

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.490 
show you the difference but it's
definitely<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.590> dark<00:01:37.920> uh<00:01:39.170> also<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
definitely really dark uh also I just

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.580 
definitely really dark uh also I just
want<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> let<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.840> 5n<00:01:42.840> light

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
want to let you know that the 5n light

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.460 
want to let you know that the 5n light
brown<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.729> neutral<00:01:45.149> tone<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.170> are<00:01:46.290> no

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
brown is a neutral tone so there are no

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
brown is a neutral tone so there are no
red<00:01:46.680> tones<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.490> hair<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.149> red

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
red tones in it my hair did have red

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
red tones in it my hair did have red
tones<00:01:48.810> previously<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.610> why

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
tones previously so I think that's why

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
tones previously so I think that's why
when<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> look<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> light<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> can

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
when you look in the light you can

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
when you look in the light you can
really<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.829> don't<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.149> red<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
really see I don't like the red which I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.790 
will not fully wash out but it will
definitely<00:02:20.800> fade<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.610> lot<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.900> don't<00:02:23.470> know<00:02:23.710> if

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
definitely fade a lot so I don't know if

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.170 
definitely fade a lot so I don't know if
I'm<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.100> continue<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.670> color<00:02:24.910> or

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
I'm going to continue with this color or

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.730 
I'm going to continue with this color or
maybe<00:02:25.390> go<00:02:25.570> with<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> lighter<00:02:25.990> color<00:02:26.080> next<00:02:26.500> time

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
maybe go with a lighter color next time

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.010 
maybe go with a lighter color next time
because<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.520> bit<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> dark

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020
