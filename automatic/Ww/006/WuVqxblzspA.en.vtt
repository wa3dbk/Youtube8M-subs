00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380
 has finished holding a meeting 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.809
 plastic rhinoplasty was made 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 and the patient has a history of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.400
 rhinoplasty prior to execution my case 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 of a synthetic material was removed the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.020
 himself and an application of his 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 end cartilages as well as putting a graft 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 with a post and a graft on the tip 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.429
 this to give more projection and better 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.320
 nose shape also performed 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.200
 Dirty osteotomy fractures in bones 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 to make the base narrower 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.579
 of the same and that goes more in agreement with the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.579
 way that was finally yielded I said no 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.920
 limited to cooperate I can no longer be here 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.390
 that same week the one explained in all 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.590
 the procedures comes to be my 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.300
 record because apart it has a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 financing then the truth is that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 It helped me a lot because I did not have to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.060
 stay with nothing to operate me 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.190
 They waited to get the money 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.230
 this week I did my studies all 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.740
 it went perfect the next week there 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.620
 Perez 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 That same day I went out and I stayed the truth 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.180
 of loose two days in my house and the day 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 next I went to work as 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.520
 normal that there is a small splint the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.130
 truth is that the card was a hard one or 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.230
 two days nothing more then it was like 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.080
 patches but the truth is that you can not tell 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.270
 both afterwards and as you have your nose 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.070
 well then now to presume not the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.980
 truth is that in the clinic he gave me 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.650
 a lot of security because I came every 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.650
 week to change the bandage that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.410
 I put on that helped me not to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.270
 will inflame both the consultations 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.070
 subsequent ones did not have any cost 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.750
 then the truth is that also that 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 we worried about having to go and 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.090
 keep paying part of my surgery 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.130
 here did not pass my credit they let me 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.680
 they started paying two months after 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 my surgery 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 and monthly payments in monthly installments 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.120
 which I could not adapt with 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 them the restrictions after the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.830
 surgery will also depend on the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.320
 extension of it but in the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.179
 first days is obviously advisable 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 do not make physical effort that does not 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.360
 do exercise that is not only in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.150
 because this will condition them to have 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.220
 Patients wear increased inflammation 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.200
 a splint a soft splint a splint 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.730
 rigid this is to limit the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.100
 inflammation to favor that the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.590
 structures heal adhere more 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.720
 fast and in the desired position and going to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.030
 have a difference a variation in 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.040
 how much time it can be three to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.190
 six weeks the limitation on 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170
 the most common activities inhabitest 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.239
 Common maybe it is going to be seven 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.520
 days and this because there is a bit of 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.940
 inflammation sometimes there is a making boxes 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.650
 that bruises are formed and that for 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.170
 some patients is somewhat uncomfortable 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.870
 especially who has dealings with the public 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 in his activity, this is what comes to him 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.470
 limit but the reality is that the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.480
 most of the daily activities the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.370
 they will be doing without much problem 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.140
 in 7 or 14 days 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.180
 other restrictions on 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.830
 physical effort exercise, we are going 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.930
 to indicate according to the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.299
 characteristics of each surgery but 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.099
 You can consider this time now 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.569
 after surgery the care a 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.620
 Once they are discharged as 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.260
 basically it 's a relative rest 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.480
 and they are at home they are recostados so 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.730
 we can both return the and not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.830
 they require more care simply 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.500
 let recovery time pass 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.690
 that reduces inflammation and with that 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.459
 it's going to be enough obviously going 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.769
 to your periodic consultations we see them 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.810
 usually every week to be 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.090
 monitoring how evolution is going and if 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.670
 it is necessary to do some other 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.340
 change or management as this has been all 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.260
 in relation to rhinoplasty surgery 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.150
 related to the nose but they 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.769
 I remember that the laser mehdi performed 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.170
 rhinoplasty and all kinds of 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.120

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.900
 receive a valuation consultation with 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.940
 without cost, highlighting that they are always going to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.400
 be taken care of in the surgeries performed 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.829
 by medical specialists in surgery 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.690
