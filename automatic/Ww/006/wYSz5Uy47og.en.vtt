00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.720
 good has been the community here I'm going to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 reporting is something important what 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.009
 to introduce myself 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.400
 he forgot to tell them that he no longer 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.460
 have a play xperia I have changed it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.829
 more or less I think that half a year no longer what 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.199
 I have however only one of my days 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.180
 family and with him sometimes I follow him 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.460
 occupying to see what else you can have and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 that can improve but good what is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.809
 explain what lass would help 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.960
 when the Spanish pepe and his videos 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.310
 they would be very few and very long 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 a very long time 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.370
 and well, I can not offer you more 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.050
 because I have seen many things they 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.550
 like to be changing the course break 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 or of the roms that I have searched since 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.480
 all very convenient for your phone 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.220
 the xperia is not very convenient for you 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.560
 but I have tried a lot to be as if not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 ate because it contains many books and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 things that can alter what is the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.260
 Memory sometimes are severe cases damage 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.940
 the processor 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.610
 what is this and that's why I'm uploaded 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.290
 many roms plus the last one that is located 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.050
 if something does not like some yes but the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 truth is very good games my mother the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.640
 has and has games that run 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.530
 normal so incredible but good thing 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 of the taste of each one is not to propose and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.190
 roms because there's really no good no 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.080
 have been good ones who know with kit 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.690
 kat and the whole thing but remember that it is 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
 an android still a bit advanced and nobody 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.320
 very slightly advanced is not familiar 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.540
 with the kipot processor that owns the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.729
 xperia play and therefore it will make a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.800
 little slow for the games however to 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.190
 Sometimes vice very beautiful and elegant the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.920
