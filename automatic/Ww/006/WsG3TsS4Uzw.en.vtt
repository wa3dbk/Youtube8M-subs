with a scarf and things of that nature

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.220 
with a scarf and things of that nature
because<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.120> hair<00:02:23.359> is<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.870> harder

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
because this hair is going to be harder

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.039 
because this hair is going to be harder
to<00:02:24.260> blend<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:25.280> basically<00:02:26.269> it's<00:02:26.540> harder<00:02:26.870> to

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
to blend it's basically it's harder to

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.319 
to blend it's basically it's harder to
blend<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.560> hair<00:02:27.889> with<00:02:28.280> your<00:02:28.489> hair<00:02:28.790> when<00:02:29.269> you

blend this hair with your hair when you

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.270 
blend this hair with your hair when you
first<00:02:29.569> get<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.049> because<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.409> mean<00:02:30.680> as<00:02:30.889> fresh

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
first get it because I mean as fresh

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.800 
it's black slept and it's shiny like
crazy<00:02:35.659> so<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.889> gonna<00:02:37.040> be<00:02:37.159> harder<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.609> do<00:02:37.760> that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
crazy so it's gonna be harder to do that

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.539
