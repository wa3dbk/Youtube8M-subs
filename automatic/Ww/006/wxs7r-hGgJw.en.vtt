quite<00:01:34.689> a<00:01:34.750> few<00:01:34.840> little<00:01:35.110> recordings<00:01:35.829> with<00:01:36.460> this

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
quite a few little recordings with this

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.450 
quite a few little recordings with this
and<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.840> was<00:01:38.320> very<00:01:38.409> pleased<00:01:38.710> with<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.219> runs

off<00:01:39.610> 12<00:01:40.240> volts<00:01:40.659> worth<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.960> batteries<00:01:41.409> so

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
off 12 volts worth of batteries so

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.889 
off 12 volts worth of batteries so
that's<00:01:41.799> an<00:01:41.979> awful<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.659> batteries<00:01:43.659> in<00:01:43.810> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that that it will feed 12 volts which is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.850 
that that it will feed 12 volts which is
the<00:02:54.000> battery<00:02:54.630> voltage<00:02:54.780> available<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.620> here

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
out as phantom power onto these so some

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.480 
out as phantom power onto these so some
of<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.180> electorate<00:03:00.660> star<00:03:01.020> microphones<00:03:01.740> would

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
of the electorate star microphones would

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.100 
of the electorate star microphones would
actually<00:03:02.940> be<00:03:03.540> able<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.750> handle<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.070> work

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
actually be able to handle that and work

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.920 
actually be able to handle that and work
so<00:03:07.110> there<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.170> Sony

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
so there we are that's that is the Sony

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.780 
so there we are that's that is the Sony
