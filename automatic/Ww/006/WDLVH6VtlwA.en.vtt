you<00:00:01.530> know<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> get<00:00:01.920> asked<00:00:02.310> many<00:00:03.030> times<00:00:03.529> what<00:00:04.529> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
you know I get asked many times what you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.249 
you know I get asked many times what you
know<00:00:05.549> if<00:00:05.640> you're<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> make<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> cut<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.690> it

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
know if you're going to make a cut is it

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.290 
know if you're going to make a cut is it
better<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.589> leave<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.799> stub<00:00:08.160> or<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.179> better

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
better to leave a stub or is it better

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.839 
better to leave a stub or is it better
to<00:00:09.389> cut<00:00:09.630> behind<00:00:09.809> here<00:00:10.260> well<00:00:10.950> neither<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.610> mean

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
to cut behind here well neither I mean

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.039 
to cut behind here well neither I mean
if<00:00:11.969> you're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.269> make<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> cut<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
if you're going to make a cut on the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.209 
if you're going to make a cut on the
tree<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.320> might<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.710> well<00:00:13.769> make<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
tree you might as well make it at the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.919 
tree you might as well make it at the
right<00:00:14.340> spot<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> exact

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
right spot and that is the exact

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.599 
right spot and that is the exact
location<00:00:16.049> where<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.830> need<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
location where you need to be making the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.300 
location where you need to be making the
cut<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.270> branch<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.289> trees<00:00:19.590> natural

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
cut on that branch the trees natural

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.759 
cut on that branch the trees natural
processes<00:00:20.939> will<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.660> over<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.260> begin

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
processes will take over and begin

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
processes will take over and begin
sealing<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.550> wound<00:00:24.029> off<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.050> leave<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
sealing that wound off if you leave a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.380 
sealing that wound off if you leave a
stub<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:26.460> will<00:00:26.609> happen<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> little

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
stub what will happen is that little

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.890 
stub what will happen is that little
stub<00:00:27.900> will<00:00:28.590> die<00:00:28.859> back<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.330> tree<00:00:30.570> cannot

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
stub will die back and the tree cannot

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.250 
stub will die back and the tree cannot
seal<00:00:31.230> over<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.769> wound<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.540> dead<00:00:33.870> stub

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
seal over that wound and that dead stub

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.319 
seal over that wound and that dead stub
there<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.160> way<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> insect<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there will be a way that insect and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660 
there will be a way that insect and
disease<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.050> into<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> tree<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.430> cut

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
disease can get into the tree if we cut

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
disease can get into the tree if we cut
behind<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.690> you're<00:00:39.870> creating<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
behind that then you're creating a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
behind that then you're creating a
larger<00:00:40.890> wound<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> tree<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.510> will

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
larger wound on the tree and so it will

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.889 
larger wound on the tree and so it will
take<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:43.170> longer<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.219> tree<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.899> seal

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
take a lot longer for that tree to seal

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.810 
take a lot longer for that tree to seal
over<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.440> being<00:00:46.590> careful<00:00:46.890> careful<00:00:47.489> here

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
over and I'm being careful careful here

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.690 
over and I'm being careful careful here
to<00:00:48.000> say<00:00:48.210> seal<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.440> healed<00:00:49.829> trees<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.670> not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to say seal and not healed trees do not

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
to say seal and not healed trees do not
heal<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> cut<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.230> finger

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
heal it's not like a cut on your finger

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.700 
heal it's not like a cut on your finger
and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> scab<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.110> gets

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and you get a scab and it's a gets

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
and you get a scab and it's a gets
better<00:00:55.980> well<00:00:56.399> every<00:00:57.210> cut<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
better well every cut you make on the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
better well every cut you make on the
tree<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.770> some<00:00:59.010> potential<00:00:59.399> internal

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
tree there's some potential internal

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
tree there's some potential internal
problems<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:00.960> creating<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
problems that you're creating so you can

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
problems that you're creating so you can
minimize<00:01:02.609> those<00:01:03.090> internal<00:01:03.660> problems<00:01:04.080> by

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
minimize those internal problems by

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410 
minimize those internal problems by
making<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> appropriate<00:01:05.070> cut<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> tree

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
making the appropriate cut on that tree

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
making the appropriate cut on that tree
to<00:01:06.990> shorten<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> time<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.400> tree<00:01:08.670> will

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to shorten the time when that tree will

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
to shorten the time when that tree will
be<00:01:08.850> sealing<00:01:09.360> over<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.750> wound<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.290> now<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
be sealing over that wound and now I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
be sealing over that wound and now I
showed<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.369> where<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> cut<00:01:12.330> now

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
showed you where we're going to cut now

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
showed you where we're going to cut now
go<00:01:12.930> ahead<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.280> step<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> limb<00:01:14.850> here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
go ahead and step out on the limb here

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
go ahead and step out on the limb here
and<00:01:15.119> try<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> cut<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> need

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and try and make that cut where I need

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.760 
and try and make that cut where I need
to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> making<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.689> have<00:01:18.689> my<00:01:18.840> loppers<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to be making it have my loppers it's a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.490 
to be making it have my loppers it's a
small<00:01:20.009> branch<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:20.640> removing<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
small branch that we're removing and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.390 
small branch that we're removing and
what<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.130> going

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.150> off<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.869> first

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
to take a little bit off of here first

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.340 
to take a little bit off of here first
and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> catch<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.049> doesn't<00:01:28.229> hit<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and I catch that so it doesn't hit the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
and I catch that so it doesn't hit the
camera<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> cleaned

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
camera there and I just kind of cleaned

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
camera there and I just kind of cleaned
up<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> area<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.560> I'll<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.100> come<00:01:32.340> back<00:01:32.520> here

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
up the area now I'll just come back here

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.960 
up the area now I'll just come back here
and<00:01:33.229> cut<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.259> along<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.159> outside<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and cut right along that the outside of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.780 
and cut right along that the outside of
the<00:01:36.030> branch<00:01:36.270> collar<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.829> these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the branch collar now when you use these

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
the branch collar now when you use these
type<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> cutters<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.560> sure

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
type of cutters you want to make sure

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.950 
type of cutters you want to make sure
this<00:01:40.950> cutting<00:01:41.369> blade<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> inside

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.120 

closest<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> trunk<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> tree<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
closest to the trunk of the tree so you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
closest to the trunk of the tree so you
get<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.729> smooth<00:01:48.299> cut<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.890> I'll

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
get a good smooth cut on there so I'll

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
get a good smooth cut on there so I'll
just<00:01:50.159> line<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:52.070> make<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.220> cut<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.170> that's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
just line that up make my cut and that's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
just line that up make my cut and that's
what<00:01:55.409> we're<00:01:55.530> after<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.909> outside

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
what we're after I'm just on the outside

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
what we're after I'm just on the outside
of<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> branch<00:01:58.110> collar<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.250> tree<00:01:59.520> I'm

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of that branch collar in that tree I'm

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
of that branch collar in that tree I'm
not<00:01:59.850> cutting<00:02:00.149> into<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> branch<00:02:00.750> collar<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
not cutting into the branch collar so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050 
not cutting into the branch collar so
that's<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> seal<00:02:02.100> over<00:02:02.310> real<00:02:02.640> nicely

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that's going to seal over real nicely

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.380 
that's going to seal over real nicely
there<00:02:03.469> now<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.790> talk<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.149> briefly

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
there now the we could talk just briefly

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.229 
there now the we could talk just briefly
about<00:02:07.200> pruning<00:02:07.680> paint<00:02:08.099> how<00:02:08.489> many<00:02:08.670> times<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
about pruning paint how many times you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.760 
about pruning paint how many times you
go<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> tree<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.349> these<00:02:10.500> black

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
go by a tree and just see these black

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.300 
go by a tree and just see these black
dots

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
dots

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
dots
it's<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.550> freckles<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> tree<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it's like freckles all over the tree you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.550 
it's like freckles all over the tree you
know

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.839 
know
someone<00:02:13.890> will<00:02:13.980> come<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.370> make<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> cut

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
someone will come in here make a cut

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.500 
someone will come in here make a cut
spray<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.660> black<00:02:16.050> pruning<00:02:16.739> sealer<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
spray the black pruning sealer on it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.390 
spray the black pruning sealer on it
it's<00:02:18.510> really<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.810> necessary<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:20.040> know<00:02:20.130> take

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's really not necessary you know take

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.550 
it's really not necessary you know take
that<00:02:20.580> old<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.090> pruning<00:02:21.420> spray<00:02:21.720> throw<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that old can of pruning spray throw it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
that old can of pruning spray throw it
away<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.950> really<00:02:23.099> don't<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.300> doesn't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
away you really don't need it it doesn't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.320 
away you really don't need it it doesn't
help<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> tree<00:02:25.410> seal<00:02:26.130> over<00:02:26.489> any<00:02:26.640> quicker<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
help the tree seal over any quicker and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.600 
help the tree seal over any quicker and
actually<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.440> research<00:02:28.800> indicates<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.459> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually some research indicates that it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.729 
actually some research indicates that it
causes<00:02:29.790> more<00:02:30.150> long-term<00:02:30.360> problems<00:02:31.200> than

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
causes more long-term problems than

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.610 
causes more long-term problems than
actually<00:02:32.160> benefits<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.989> those<00:02:34.080> problems

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
actually benefits one of those problems

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.089 
actually benefits one of those problems
is<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.959> trunk<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
is that if you get it on the trunk of

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.309 
is that if you get it on the trunk of
the<00:02:38.160> tree<00:02:38.190> real<00:02:38.670> thick<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.660> actually<00:02:40.110> with

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
the tree real thick then actually with

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.320 
the tree real thick then actually with
rain<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.280> tree<00:02:41.519> branch<00:02:41.670> gets<00:02:42.000> wet

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
rain and as that tree branch gets wet

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.809 
rain and as that tree branch gets wet
it'll<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:43.260> trap<00:02:43.560> moisture<00:02:44.069> behind<00:02:44.280> that

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
it'll actually trap moisture behind that

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.360 
it'll actually trap moisture behind that
tar<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.330> cause<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:45.750> fungus<00:02:46.110> problems<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
tar and cause some fungus problems so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.670 
tar and cause some fungus problems so
don't<00:02:48.060> use<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.569> throw<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.049> away<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.500> not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
don't use it throw it away it's not

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.640 
don't use it throw it away it's not
needed<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.760> only<00:02:51.299> time<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> would<00:02:51.900> say<00:02:52.350> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
needed the only time I would say that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.800 
needed the only time I would say that
you<00:02:52.769> may<00:02:52.950> want<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.280> use<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.510> cut<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
you may want to use it is if you cut a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.949 
you may want to use it is if you cut a
large<00:02:55.350> limb<00:02:56.100> off<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.209> say<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
large limb off of it and say you have a

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.789 
large limb off of it and say you have a
dark<00:02:58.410> trunk<00:02:59.069> tree<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> very<00:03:01.500> very

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
dark trunk tree then just a very very

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.339 
dark trunk tree then just a very very
light<00:03:02.040> application<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> spray<00:03:03.569> for

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
light application of the spray for

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.410 
light application of the spray for
cosmetics<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.880> only<00:03:06.120> thing<00:03:06.269> it's

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
cosmetics and that's the only thing it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.949 
cosmetics and that's the only thing it's
good<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:09.030> we're<00:03:09.150> going<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.299> do<00:03:09.450> now<00:03:09.660> then

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
good for what we're going to do now then

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.839 
good for what we're going to do now then
since<00:03:10.170> I've<00:03:10.380> shown<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.680> an<00:03:11.099> exact<00:03:11.549> spot<00:03:11.700> on

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
since I've shown you an exact spot on

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.400 
since I've shown you an exact spot on
that<00:03:12.150> tree<00:03:12.390> I'm<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> go<00:03:12.900> ahead<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.290> now

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that tree I'm going to go ahead and now

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.500 
that tree I'm going to go ahead and now
go<00:03:14.099> through<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.459> whole<00:03:14.580> process<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:15.269> pruning

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
go through the whole process of pruning

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.059 
go through the whole process of pruning
this<00:03:15.780> tree<00:03:16.019> I'm<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.380> remove<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> dead

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
this tree I'm going to remove the dead

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.620 
this tree I'm going to remove the dead
I'm<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.850> remove<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.180> crossing

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
I'm going to remove the crossing

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780 
I'm going to remove the crossing
branches<00:03:18.890> then<00:03:19.890> I'm<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.190> step<00:03:20.519> back

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
branches then I'm going to step back

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.210 
branches then I'm going to step back
take<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.299> look<00:03:21.420> at<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.750> tree<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.200> begin<00:03:22.799> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
take a look at the tree and begin to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.699 
take a look at the tree and begin to
balance<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> tree<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.180> shape<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.019> enhance

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
balance the tree in shape and enhance

the job on the tree the one thing that I

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
important point to remember is that you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.670 
important point to remember is that you
should<00:03:39.000> never<00:03:39.269> remove<00:03:39.540> more<00:03:39.930> than<00:03:39.989> one-third

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
should never remove more than one-third

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.590 
should never remove more than one-third
the<00:03:40.890> total<00:03:41.220> amount<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.579> branches<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.209> tree

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
the total amount of branches on the tree

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.930 
the total amount of branches on the tree
the<00:03:43.109> older<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.590> tree<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:43.980> less<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.850> would

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
the older the tree is the less you would

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.840 
the older the tree is the less you would
want<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.269> remove<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:45.720> maybe<00:03:45.930> 25%<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.519> I'm<00:03:47.639> just

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
want to remove so maybe 25% so I'm just

time and do it right and you're only
pruning<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.819> tree<00:03:57.120> once<00:03:57.359> so<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:58.410> with

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
pruning that tree once so just go with

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:30.830 
pruning that tree once so just go with
it

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.440

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.260 
see I didn't take so long you can really
get<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.630> good<00:04:34.930> feeling<00:04:35.230> on<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.580> tree<00:04:36.850> before

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
get a good feeling on the tree before

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.750 
get a good feeling on the tree before
and<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.990> tree<00:04:38.260> after<00:04:38.440> we've<00:04:39.160> opened<00:04:39.610> up<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
and the tree after we've opened up the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.430 
and the tree after we've opened up the
crown<00:04:40.120> we've<00:04:40.600> removed<00:04:40.870> all<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.140> dead

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
crown we've removed all the dead

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.380 
crown we've removed all the dead
branches<00:04:41.860> like<00:04:42.010> we<00:04:42.190> talked<00:04:42.400> about<00:04:42.550> we<00:04:43.240> have

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
branches like we talked about we have

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.330 
branches like we talked about we have
removed<00:04:43.690> all<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.290> crossing<00:04:44.740> branches<00:04:44.890> as

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
removed all of the crossing branches as

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.490 
removed all of the crossing branches as
we<00:04:45.670> discussed<00:04:46.120> we<00:04:46.750> removed<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.230> lot<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
we discussed we removed a lot of the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.930 
we discussed we removed a lot of the
branches<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:48.010> were<00:04:48.160> growing<00:04:48.550> into<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
branches that were growing into the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.060 
branches that were growing into the
center<00:04:49.240> part<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.780> crown<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.890> we're

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
center part of the crown so we're

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.160 
center part of the crown so we're
opening<00:04:51.460> up<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.670> tree<00:04:52.090> more<00:04:52.510> we've<00:04:52.990> just

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
opening up the tree more we've just

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.750 
opening up the tree more we've just
taken<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.500> short<00:04:53.740> amount<00:04:53.920> of<00:04:54.100> time<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.580> go
