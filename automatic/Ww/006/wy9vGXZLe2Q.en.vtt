00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
do is have it scan all the channels so

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.770 
do is have it scan all the channels so
if<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.250> plug<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.580> into<00:03:25.700> your<00:03:25.850> cable<00:03:26.090> box<00:03:26.480> and

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
if you plug it into your cable box and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.780 
if you plug it into your cable box and
you<00:03:26.900> want<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.440> detect<00:03:28.040> all<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.280> channels

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
you want it to detect all the channels

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.400 
you want it to detect all the channels
and<00:03:28.940> later<00:03:29.270> on<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.600> can<00:03:29.720> schedule<00:03:29.990> things

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
and later on you can schedule things

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.100 
and later on you can schedule things
right<00:03:31.100> that's<00:03:31.490> like<00:03:31.670> like<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> PVR<00:03:32.420> basically

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
right that's like like a PVR basically

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.410 
right that's like like a PVR basically
and<00:03:33.350> that's<00:03:34.070> what<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.610> really<00:03:34.760> meant<00:03:35.330> to

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420
