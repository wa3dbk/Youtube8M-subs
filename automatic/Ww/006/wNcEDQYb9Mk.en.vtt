then enemy will be stunned for six
seconds<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:28.579> PvP<00:01:29.579> ish<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
seconds so again it's very PvP ish I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.929 
seconds so again it's very PvP ish I
guess<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.979> stunning<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
guess it's going to be stunning and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.490 
guess it's going to be stunning and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
slowing see what this looks like that's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.390 
slowing see what this looks like that's
a<00:01:37.619> very<00:01:37.860> cool<00:01:38.159> spell<00:01:38.460> effect<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> stuns
