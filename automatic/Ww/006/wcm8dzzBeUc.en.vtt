one guy that I sort of pointed the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.100 
one guy that I sort of pointed the
finger<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> said<00:00:33.480> he's<00:00:33.750> gonna<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:33.989> a

and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> sudden<00:00:43.079> he<00:00:43.350> had<00:00:43.469> his

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and then all of a sudden he had his

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.360 
and then all of a sudden he had his
problems<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.129> Molina<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:46.370> Molina

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
problems with Molina and then Molina

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
left she was released the Divina thought

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
left she was released the Divina thought

happen<00:01:10.439> happened<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.939> don't<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.229> think

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
happen happened and I don't know I think

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.960

Morrison<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:13.920> himself<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> bad<00:01:14.460> spot<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Morrison put himself in a bad spot but I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
Morrison put himself in a bad spot but I
think<00:01:15.150> he's<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> very<00:01:15.570> talented<00:01:15.930> wrestler<00:01:16.650> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
think he's a very talented wrestler they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
think he's a very talented wrestler they
can<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> lot<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.650> didn't<00:01:20.040> think

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
can do a lot and I really didn't think

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
can do a lot and I really didn't think
his<00:01:20.369> break<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.850> Dovie<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.509> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
his break from Dovie would take this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.469 
his break from Dovie would take this
long<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.960> thought<00:01:22.110> maybe<00:01:22.290> he<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:22.979> gonna

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
long I thought maybe he was just gonna

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
long I thought maybe he was just gonna
recharge<00:01:24.479> his<00:01:24.810> batteries<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.619> he'd<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
recharge his batteries and he'd be on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
recharge his batteries and he'd be on
the<00:01:26.430> road<00:01:26.700> sooner<00:01:26.970> than<00:01:27.150> later<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.590> been

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

I<00:01:53.850> said<00:01:53.909> John<00:01:54.270> Morrison's<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> huge<00:01:55.229> load

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I said John Morrison's got a huge load

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
I said John Morrison's got a huge load
of<00:01:55.920> talent<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.119> needs<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.479> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of talent that I think it needs to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
of talent that I think it needs to be
either<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.469> Monday<00:01:58.740> Night<00:01:58.890> Raw<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.250> Smackdown

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
either on Monday Night Raw or Smackdown

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
either on Monday Night Raw or Smackdown
and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:01.320> getting<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.100> mainstream

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and I think this getting this mainstream

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.249 
and I think this getting this mainstream
publicity<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> good<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.990> maybe<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
publicity is good because there maybe is

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.230 
publicity is good because there maybe is
looking<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.829> mainstream<00:02:05.189> Felicity<00:02:05.939> any<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
looking for mainstream Felicity any of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
looking for mainstream Felicity any of
the<00:02:06.329> way<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> think

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the way that they can get it and I think

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.330 
the way that they can get it and I think
John<00:02:08.310> Morrison<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.080> homegrown<00:02:10.080> talent<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
