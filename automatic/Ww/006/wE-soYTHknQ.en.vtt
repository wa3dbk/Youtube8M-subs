wouldn't be surprised according to the

cloud cover if that was in fact the case

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.910 
cloud cover if that was in fact the case
today<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.960> we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.140> put<00:00:22.320> list<00:00:22.590> partly

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
today so we're going to put list partly

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
today so we're going to put list partly
cloudy<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.490> grids<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.810> know<00:00:24.930> if

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
cloudy in the grids here but you know if

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.599 
cloudy in the grids here but you know if
we<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.350> end<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.920> clouds<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.369> sun

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
we do end up for more clouds and sun

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
we do end up for more clouds and sun
that's<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> am<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> gfs<00:00:28.800> had<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that's because the am and gfs had the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
that's because the am and gfs had the
right<00:00:29.279> idea<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:30.119> how<00:00:30.330> today<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
right idea with how today was going to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
right idea with how today was going to
unfold<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.949> does<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.279> fact<00:00:32.340> take<00:00:32.820> place

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
unfold if that does in fact take place

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
unfold if that does in fact take place
we<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.690> temperatures<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> little<00:00:34.140> bit<00:00:34.410> lower

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
we want temperatures a little bit lower

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.299 
we want temperatures a little bit lower
than<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.430> posted<00:00:35.640> guidance<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:37.160> we're<00:00:38.160> going

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
than the posted guidance but we're going

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
than the posted guidance but we're going
to<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.660> turner<00:00:39.660> eyesore<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.110> next<00:00:40.350> system

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to have a turner eyesore our next system

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
to have a turner eyesore our next system
here<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> clipper<00:00:41.370> system<00:00:41.820> that's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
here which is a clipper system that's

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
here which is a clipper system that's
going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> move<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.640> wednesday

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
going to move in here for for wednesday

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479 
going to move in here for for wednesday
here<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.840> comes<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.379> late<00:00:47.370> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
here and i think this comes in late in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
here and i think this comes in late in
the<00:00:47.579> day<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.750> mid<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> late

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the day like you know mid to late

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
the day like you know mid to late
afternoon<00:00:49.460> maybe<00:00:50.460> early<00:00:50.910> evening<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.480> some

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
afternoon maybe early evening for some

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.439 
afternoon maybe early evening for some
areas<00:00:52.020> further<00:00:52.949> east<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.640> we'll<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.180> some

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
areas further east but we'll have some

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
areas further east but we'll have some
snow<00:00:54.780> move<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.579> that's<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
snow move in here that's going to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.889 
snow move in here that's going to
continue<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> overnight<00:00:57.480> hours

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
continue through the overnight hours

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.319 
continue through the overnight hours
here<00:00:58.530> kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.489> off<00:00:59.550> snow<00:00:59.910> showers

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
here kind of on and off snow showers

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
here kind of on and off snow showers
here<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.500> very<00:01:01.829> light<00:01:02.160> light

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
here that will just be very light light

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.179 
here that will just be very light light
snow<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.690> accumulate<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:05.070> by

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
snow and will accumulate little by

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
snow and will accumulate little by
little<00:01:05.330> through<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> course<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> night

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
little through the course of the night

little through the course of the night
and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:08.010> Thursday<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.180> going

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and then into Thursday we're also going

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
and then into Thursday we're also going
to<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> look<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:10.920> overnight

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to have here so a look at overnight

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.480 
to have here so a look at overnight
Wednesday<00:01:12.299> night<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.920> guys<00:01:14.040> also<00:01:14.340> going

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
Wednesday night here you guys also going

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.999 
Wednesday night here you guys also going
to<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> piece<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> upper<00:01:15.330> level<00:01:15.600> energy

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
to have a piece of upper level energy

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.190 
to have a piece of upper level energy
level<00:01:17.009> energy<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
level energy that's going to have to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
level energy that's going to have to
move<00:01:19.200> through<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.710> trailing<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.400> system

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
move through this trailing this system

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
move through this trailing this system
it's<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> favor<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> areas<00:01:22.830> further

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's going to favor the areas further

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
it's going to favor the areas further
the<00:01:23.280> North<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.570> here's<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.869> low

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the North here but here's our low

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510 
the North here but here's our low
pressure<00:01:25.259> consolidating<00:01:25.890> offshore<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pressure consolidating offshore and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
pressure consolidating offshore and
taking<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> northeast<00:01:28.560> here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
taking off to the northeast here

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
taking off to the northeast here
upper-level<00:01:29.700> energy<00:01:29.850> Charlie<00:01:30.450> behind<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
upper-level energy Charlie behind it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
upper-level energy Charlie behind it
will<00:01:31.439> give<00:01:31.650> us<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> few<00:01:31.979> snow<00:01:32.189> showers<00:01:32.220> yet<00:01:32.820> on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
will give us a few snow showers yet on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.170 
will give us a few snow showers yet on
Thursday<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> few<00:01:33.930> snow<00:01:34.140> showers<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> flurries

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
Thursday a few snow showers and flurries

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.310 
Thursday a few snow showers and flurries
and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.390> that'll<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and then that'll be out of here so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
and then that'll be out of here so
that's<00:01:37.470> our<00:01:37.619> clipper<00:01:37.860> system<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> big<00:01:39.180> deal

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that's our clipper system not a big deal

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
that's our clipper system not a big deal
I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> upside<00:01:40.710> potential<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I think the upside potential for this is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
I think the upside potential for this is
for<00:01:41.970> someone<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:42.930> inches<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
for someone to see three inches out of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
for someone to see three inches out of
it<00:01:43.649> tops<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.820> most<00:01:45.329> areas<00:01:45.509> are<00:01:45.689> probably<00:01:46.020> less

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it tops but most areas are probably less

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.219 
it tops but most areas are probably less
than<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.540> not<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> big<00:01:48.780> deal<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
than that and not a big deal from that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
than that and not a big deal from that
clipper<00:01:49.470> system<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.159> no<00:01:50.310> nonetheless<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
clipper system but it's no nonetheless I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
clipper system but it's no nonetheless I
don't<00:01:51.720> downplay<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> point<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:52.740> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
don't downplay to the point where it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't downplay to the point where it's
take<00:01:53.100> ignored<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> take<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.720> will

take ignored we get will to take it will
have<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.409> travel<00:01:55.829> impacts<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
have some travel impacts as the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
have some travel impacts as the
temperatures<00:01:56.909> will<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.509> low<00:01:57.689> enough<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
temperatures will be low enough that it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
temperatures will be low enough that it
will<00:01:58.290> stick<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> roads<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.790> we're

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
will stick to the roads and then we're

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
will stick to the roads and then we're
going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> turn<00:02:00.180> our<00:02:00.240> attention<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> weekend

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
going to turn our attention the weekend

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380 
going to turn our attention the weekend
now<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.369> gets<00:02:02.579> very<00:02:02.729> interesting<00:02:03.270> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
now it's gets very interesting because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.709 
now it's gets very interesting because
we<00:02:04.049> got<00:02:04.140> high<00:02:04.290> pressure<00:02:04.560> moving<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> friday

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
we got high pressure moving in friday

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.910 
we got high pressure moving in friday
and<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.930> should<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> nice<00:02:07.320> day<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.530> friday

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and we should have a nice day on friday

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
and we should have a nice day on friday
actually<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.789> rest<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> thursday<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.569> friday

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
actually the rest of thursday and friday

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
actually the rest of thursday and friday
and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> look<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.629> at

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and then if you look at the look look at

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then if you look at the look look at
the<00:02:12.810> forecast<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> week

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the forecast for the week

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.720 
the forecast for the week
again<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.980> looks<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.340> ran<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.610> nice

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
again it looks like we ran out of a nice

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.820 
again it looks like we ran out of a nice
weekend<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.510> far<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.200> mostly<00:02:16.560> sunny

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
weekend as far as you know mostly sunny

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.410 
weekend as far as you know mostly sunny

partly cloud for this Lenny what do you
want<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> call<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> models<00:02:20.220> are<00:02:20.340> not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
want to call it but the models are not

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940 
want to call it but the models are not
done<00:02:21.210> playing<00:02:21.570> with<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.170> system<00:02:22.680> here

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
done playing with this system here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
done playing with this system here
coming<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.580> from<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> Gulf<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.240> Mexico<00:02:24.780> here

coming out from the Gulf of Mexico here

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.740 
coming out from the Gulf of Mexico here
and<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> keep<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.270> close<00:02:27.480> eye<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and this we have to keep a close eye on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.540 
and this we have to keep a close eye on
here<00:02:28.140> there's<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.380> system<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:28.980> calling<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
here there's a system here calling the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.430 
here there's a system here calling the
picture<00:02:29.820> here<00:02:29.970> from<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> south<00:02:30.450> looks<00:02:31.260> like

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
picture here from the south looks like

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.050 
picture here from the south looks like
it's<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.710> make<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> beeline<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.550> us<00:02:32.820> here

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it's going to make a beeline for us here

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.780 
it's going to make a beeline for us here
in<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.390> Northeast<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.710> comes<00:02:34.980> oh<00:02:35.190> so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
in the Northeast and it comes oh so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.260 
in the Northeast and it comes oh so
close<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.540> model<00:02:36.810> guidance<00:02:37.080> here<00:02:37.560> oh<00:02:38.270> so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
close on this model guidance here oh so

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.350 
close on this model guidance here oh so
close<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.870> has<00:02:40.500> been<00:02:40.710> trending<00:02:41.010> closer<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
close and has been trending closer the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.810 
close and has been trending closer the
last<00:02:42.570> couple<00:02:42.750> days<00:02:43.160> they're<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.460> today

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
last couple days they're actually today

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.320 
last couple days they're actually today
i<00:02:45.060> should<00:02:45.420> say<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> last<00:02:45.960> day<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.410> before

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
i should say the last day or so before

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.880 
i should say the last day or so before
that<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> idea<00:02:48.660> was<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.200> take<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.530> system

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
that the idea was to take this system

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.140 
that the idea was to take this system
and<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.070> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> set<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.640> out<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and just kind of set it out this way and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.990 
and just kind of set it out this way and
share<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> out<00:02:51.840> not<00:02:52.620> develop<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.670> models

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
share it out not develop it the models

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.490 
share it out not develop it the models
are<00:02:54.060> starting<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.360> develop<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.930> system<00:02:55.380> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
are starting to develop this system and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.590 
are starting to develop this system and
bring<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.310> further<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.790> north<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.510> I've

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
bring it further to north now so I've

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.120 
bring it further to north now so I've
got<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.810> keep<00:02:57.900> an<00:02:58.080> eye<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:58.770> because

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
got to keep an eye on this now because

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.340 
got to keep an eye on this now because
this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.490> favorable<00:03:00.030> time<00:03:00.180> frame<00:03:00.540> look<00:03:01.170> how

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
this is a favorable time frame look how

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.350 
this is a favorable time frame look how
close<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.890> thing<00:03:02.130> gets<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
close this thing gets it's all a out to

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.450 
close this thing gets it's all a out to
Hatteras<00:03:03.980> already<00:03:04.980> some<00:03:05.190> precipitation

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
Hatteras already some precipitation

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.400 
Hatteras already some precipitation
trying<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.300> nudge<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.080> southern

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
trying to nudge in here to southern

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.150 
trying to nudge in here to southern
Delaware<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.210> getting<00:03:09.420> awfully<00:03:09.810> close

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
Delaware so it's getting awfully close

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.360 
Delaware so it's getting awfully close
any<00:03:11.160> further<00:03:11.370> northwest<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.160> thing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
any further northwest that this thing

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.770 
any further northwest that this thing
comes<00:03:14.610> will<00:03:14.820> we<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:15.060> we'd<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.360> talking<00:03:15.510> about<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
comes will we be we'd be talking about a

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
of our coverage area here so we'll have

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.150 
of our coverage area here so we'll have
to<00:03:36.420> keep<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.630> close<00:03:36.780> close<00:03:37.410> tabs<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
see how this plays out because my

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.470 
see how this plays out because my
feeling<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.190> models<00:03:41.520> are<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.760> done<00:03:42.000> trending

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
feeling the models are not done trending

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.970 
feeling the models are not done trending
northwest<00:03:42.990> with<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.590> has<00:03:43.709> been<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
northwest with this and that has been a

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.650 
northwest with this and that has been a
trend<00:03:44.280> stead<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.000> sitting<00:03:45.270> this<00:03:45.390> thing

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
trend stead of sitting this thing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.020 
trend stead of sitting this thing
aimlessly<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.770> see<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.550> trend<00:03:47.880> has<00:03:47.940> been

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
aimlessly have to see the trend has been

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.910 
aimlessly have to see the trend has been
to<00:03:48.270> pull<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.690> thing<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.200> northwest<00:03:49.620> now

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
to pull this thing to the northwest now

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.550 
to pull this thing to the northwest now
so<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:51.270> know<00:03:51.390> it's<00:03:51.570> been<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.020> Northwest

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
so you know it's been going Northwest

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
so you know it's been going Northwest
about<00:03:52.860> 150<00:03:53.430> miles<00:03:53.640> for<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:53.970> last<00:03:54.150> couple<00:03:54.330> runs

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
about 150 miles for the last couple runs

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.570 
about 150 miles for the last couple runs
here<00:03:54.990> is<00:03:55.140> getting<00:03:55.350> dangerously<00:03:55.980> close<00:03:56.070> here

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
here is getting dangerously close here

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.890 
here is getting dangerously close here
so<00:03:56.700> we're<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> give<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.120> close<00:03:57.330> eye<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.570> it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so we're going to give a close eye on it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.690 
so we're going to give a close eye on it
