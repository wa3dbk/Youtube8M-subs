00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.150 

motoring<00:02:42.760> up<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.270> point<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.170> Bribie

motoring up to the point of Bribie
Island<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:47.740> smack<00:02:48.069> into<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.430> wind

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
Island this smack into the wind

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.730 
Island this smack into the wind
I<00:02:49.120> tried<00:02:50.110> tacking<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.640> tide<00:02:52.330> was<00:02:53.140> taking

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
I tried tacking but the tide was taking

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.080 
I tried tacking but the tide was taking
me<00:02:53.860> back<00:02:54.010> too<00:02:54.250> much<00:02:54.459> I'll<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.819> here<00:02:54.940> forever

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090

till the tide turn

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.600 
till the tide turn
so<00:02:56.890> we're<00:02:57.160> making<00:02:57.280> away<00:02:58.709> most<00:02:59.709> ensure<00:03:00.130> out<00:03:00.430> of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
so we're making away most ensure out of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.880 
so we're making away most ensure out of
the<00:03:00.700> ties<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.600> point<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:02.680> hopefully

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the ties to the point and then hopefully

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.290 
the ties to the point and then hopefully
I<00:03:03.130> shall<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.550> able<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.730> make<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.120> towards

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
I shall be able to make it towards

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.930
