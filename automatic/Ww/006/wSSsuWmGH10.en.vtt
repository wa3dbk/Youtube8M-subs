00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.730
 the description 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.620
 I'm going to leave this right delete 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.650
 you simply when you download it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.570
 of good drag these two to your 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.270
 desk to where they want to be 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.040
 I downloaded them 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.110
 and later 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.600
 and these two are simply going to be 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.290
 these two the only one that occupies installation 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.330
 is the launcher but good to open 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.940
 This simply give you now double 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.050
 click and run and already tell them I do not 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.010
 I'm going to do it because it stops me recording 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.229
 because it changes it changes the east it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.880
 change the settings to see 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.470
 how it looks rather I do not know what it's called 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 but the configuration is and it leaves me 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.180
 record is to implement it in executing and already 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.070
 enter the game if it is if it works 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.840
 it was completely and completely village 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 you need to apply no crack or anything 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.490
 you just open it and this if you want 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.640
 to see more greater security do you 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.200
 execute as administrator and those that do 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.960
 and well let's proceed with the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.550
 installation of minecraft you are going 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 to give here to execute and they are going to 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.750
 open your the launcher let's hope that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.700
 will open us if you what to update 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.600

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.890
 to update simply to see what ok 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.760
 when you have time what 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 update 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:59.810
 and more waiting so much that he must put his 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.470
 user for when for example they see 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.010
 enter a game online or things like that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.320
 for example, I reward 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.820
 and you are going to put them you can put 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.660
 that you want and you just do 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.980
 exposes this and well then you already 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.750
 dan on play 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.560
 well I'll try to see if it 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.480
 can go right now I'm going to play the 1.8 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.610
 point 1 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.709
 and when you are the first time and not 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.650
 they have downloaded minecraft they are going to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.420
 download the folders the things and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.879
 it's going to take about ten minutes 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.150
 in download sequence go downloaded 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.599
 they're going to close this tab and it's going 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.129
 to go directly open my car if you do not 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.379
 it works say music better 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.730
 they just have to take a 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.890
 little the first time you open it 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 transfer system but if you have brands 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.269
 installed understand a launcher by 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.500
 example is not functional to a chip that 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.220
 he is a thief but he has already downloaded 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 folder of 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.500
 Minecraft which it is put in by 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.819
 hundred app data and then you get more 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.859
 all right 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.719
 you have the one to fight because it is 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.030
 in this here they have already been shining 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.659
 he opened me as you can see everything works 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.019
 point 8.1 fertilizer and good 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.159
 we are simply going to start a world a 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.799
 world that I already have created simply 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.239
 so that if it works completely at 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.389
 just as you can not record what they're going to 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.389
 do 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.150
 I hope you have served them for God
