00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
steps along the way it's kind of quickly

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.150 
steps along the way it's kind of quickly
run<00:00:12.360> through<00:00:12.389> them<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.500> bit<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> closer

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
run through them all a bit of a closer

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
run through them all a bit of a closer
look<00:00:14.429> there'll<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.759> slower<00:00:15.179> versions<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
look there'll be slower versions of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.689 
look there'll be slower versions of

ok<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.859> started<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> black<00:00:27.090> spray

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
ok so I started out with a black spray

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
ok so I started out with a black spray
paint<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.960> put<00:00:28.590> everything<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.920> toothpicks

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
paint I put everything on toothpicks

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.650 
paint I put everything on toothpicks
there<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.210> sure<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> got<00:00:30.510> everything

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
there just to make sure I got everything

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
there just to make sure I got everything
sprayed<00:00:31.260> nicely<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> there's<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> base

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
sprayed nicely and there's all the base

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.220 
sprayed nicely and there's all the base
coats<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> looks<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.200> looks

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
coats what it looks like so it looks

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.069 
coats what it looks like so it looks
pretty<00:00:34.469> crummy<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.850> flat<00:00:36.270> colors<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
pretty crummy with just flat colors so I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
pretty crummy with just flat colors so I
basically<00:00:37.800> did<00:00:37.980> everything<00:00:38.040> according<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
basically did everything according to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
basically did everything according to
the<00:00:39.300> painting<00:00:39.570> guide<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:40.140> showing<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the painting guide I'm showing at the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
the painting guide I'm showing at the
end<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:41.910> blog<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.110> putting

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
end and on my blog and now I'm putting

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.420 
end and on my blog and now I'm putting
on<00:00:43.730> all<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.530> washes<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> do

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
on all of the washes so I like to do

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
on all of the washes so I like to do
especially<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.300> characters<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> do

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
especially for characters I like to do

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.170 
especially for characters I like to do
all<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> base<00:00:49.469> colors<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> wash<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
all the base colors and then the wash is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.889 
all the base colors and then the wash is
in<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.899> mostly<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.750> makes<00:00:54.750> sure<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
in one go mostly because it makes sure I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
in one go mostly because it makes sure I
don't<00:00:54.989> miss<00:00:55.260> any<00:00:55.320> areas<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.219> back

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
don't miss any areas and have to go back

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
don't miss any areas and have to go back
and<00:00:56.699> touch<00:00:56.789> anything<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.960> washes<00:00:58.379> are<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and touch anything up the washes are a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
and touch anything up the washes are a
bit<00:00:58.680> more<00:00:59.280> forgiving<00:00:59.820> than<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
bit more forgiving than going back and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
bit more forgiving than going back and
doing<00:01:01.079> layers<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> sort<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.309> thing

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
doing layers and all that sort of thing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
doing layers and all that sort of thing
so<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:03.719> end<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.930> making<00:01:04.080> everything<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> bit

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
so they end up making everything a bit

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
so they end up making everything a bit
darker<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.400> doesn't<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.640> matter<00:01:05.820> if

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
darker so it doesn't really matter if

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
darker so it doesn't really matter if
you<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.240> overlap<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.560> there's<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you get overlap a bit so there's what it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
you get overlap a bit so there's what it
looks<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> washes<00:01:08.909> same

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
looks like with all the washes same

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
looks like with all the washes same
basic<00:01:10.080> idea<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.710> everything<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
basic idea but everything is just a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
basic idea but everything is just a
little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.790> darker<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.960> taking<00:01:13.200> off

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
little bit darker so now I'm taking off

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
little bit darker so now I'm taking off
the<00:01:13.770> paper<00:01:14.340> clips<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.939> assembled

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the paper clips and I assembled

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
the paper clips and I assembled
everything<00:01:15.680> thinking<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.100> can't

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
everything thinking that if I can't

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
everything thinking that if I can't
reach<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.640> well<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.850> least<00:01:17.909> it'll<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
reach it well at least it'll be the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.109 
reach it well at least it'll be the
darkest<00:01:18.780> shade<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> that'll<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.640> fine

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
darkest shade and that'll be fine

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
darkest shade and that'll be fine
so<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> basing<00:01:22.200> material<00:01:22.680> on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
so then I put the basing material on

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.060 
so then I put the basing material on
there<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.340> sand<00:01:23.640> painted<00:01:24.180> brown<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
there which is sand painted brown and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
there which is sand painted brown and
then<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.220> gonna<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.520> highlighting<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
then I'm gonna be highlighting up so I'm

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170 
then I'm gonna be highlighting up so I'm
kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> line<00:01:28.200> highlighting<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.400> black<00:01:29.970> with

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
kind of line highlighting the black with

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.780 
kind of line highlighting the black with
dark<00:01:30.390> reaper<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.220> around<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
dark reaper here so going around all the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
iron breaker now and going around all

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.850 
iron breaker now and going around all
the<00:01:45.479> edges<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> silver<00:01:46.380> trying<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the edges of the silver trying to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.530 
the edges of the silver trying to
highlight<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.299> kind<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
highlight that up as if it's kind of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.410 
highlight that up as if it's kind of
worn<00:01:48.840> shiny<00:01:49.740> again<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
worn shiny again and that's all the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.200 
worn shiny again and that's all the
silver<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.320> bother<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:54.060> am

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
silver I'm gonna bother with that I am

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.950 
silver I'm gonna bother with that I am
doing<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.070> mihalick<00:01:56.210> oxide<00:01:57.210> stuff<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
doing the mihalick oxide stuff so this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
doing the mihalick oxide stuff so this
is<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> sort<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.710> patina<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.850> going

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is the sort of a patina and it's going

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450 
is the sort of a patina and it's going
on<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> brass<00:02:00.899> colors<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> idea

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
on all of the brass colors and the idea

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
on all of the brass colors and the idea
here<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> they'll<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> sort<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
here is that they'll all be sort of a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.590 
here is that they'll all be sort of a
bronzey<00:02:05.040> type<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> thing<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.570> really

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
bronzey type of a thing and I really

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.650 
bronzey type of a thing and I really
like<00:02:07.020> how<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.819> turquoise<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
like how that the the turquoise kind of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.070 
like how that the the turquoise kind of
brings<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.289> an<00:02:10.440> extra<00:02:10.739> color

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
brings out an extra color

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.720 
brings out an extra color
and<00:02:11.170> everything<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.370> what<00:02:12.640> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and everything so you can see what it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.440 
and everything so you can see what it
looks<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.240> all<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.680> patina<00:02:14.680> done

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
looks like with all the patina done

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.990 
looks like with all the patina done
adding<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.600> some<00:02:16.900> wag<00:02:17.440> flesh<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.250> then<00:02:18.460> war

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
adding on some wag flesh and then war

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.360 
adding on some wag flesh and then war
boss<00:02:19.210> green<00:02:19.630> layers<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> flesh<00:02:21.160> here

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
boss green layers on to the flesh here

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.260 
boss green layers on to the flesh here
so<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.300> helps<00:02:22.510> bring<00:02:22.720> everything<00:02:22.990> up<00:02:23.230> nicely

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
so that helps bring everything up nicely

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.400 
so that helps bring everything up nicely
I'm<00:02:25.270> gonna<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.570> spending<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.900> bit<00:02:26.020> more<00:02:26.050> time

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
I'm gonna be spending a bit more time

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.140 
I'm gonna be spending a bit more time
with<00:02:26.470> each<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.190> colors<00:02:27.460> than<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.910> would

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
with each of the colors than I would

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.430 
with each of the colors than I would
have<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.390> regular<00:02:28.720> troops<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.200> because

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
have at the regular troops just because

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.210 
have at the regular troops just because
this<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:30.150> HQ<00:02:31.150> choice<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.530> gonna<00:02:32.620> look

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
this is a HQ choice and it's gonna look

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.760 
this is a HQ choice and it's gonna look
a<00:02:33.340> lot<00:02:33.460> better<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> tabletop<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.200> how

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
a lot better on the tabletop so how

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.980 
a lot better on the tabletop so how
shoot<00:02:36.010> copper<00:02:36.550> over<00:02:37.240> top<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
shoot copper over top of all of the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.510 
shoot copper over top of all of the
patina<00:02:38.230> stuff<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.710> what<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.950> does<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
patina stuff so what this does is it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.790 
patina stuff so what this does is it
looks<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.270> copper<00:02:41.110> sort<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.380> wearing

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
looks like the copper sort of wearing

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.060 
looks like the copper sort of wearing
through<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.430> all<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.910> raised<00:02:43.210> bits<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
through on all of the raised bits and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.060 
through on all of the raised bits and
just<00:02:45.070> helps<00:02:45.370> bring<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.940> would've<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.480> bit

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
just helps bring it I would've get a bit

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.400 
just helps bring it I would've get a bit
okay<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.520> warp<00:02:49.260> whatever<00:02:50.260> these

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
okay so for the warp whatever these

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.170 
okay so for the warp whatever these
things<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.890> around<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.640> front<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:51.970> shock

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
things are around the front of the shock

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.020 
things are around the front of the shock
attack<00:02:52.330> gun<00:02:52.780> I'm<00:02:53.620> using<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.160> tech<00:02:54.340> green<00:02:54.640> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.760 
those sort of turquoisey colors all the
way<00:02:57.580> through<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:59.110> make<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.380> look<00:02:59.530> as<00:02:59.650> though

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
way through to make it look as though

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.470 
way through to make it look as though
it's<00:02:59.950> glowing<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.580> sort<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.790> lightning<00:03:01.150> bolts

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it's glowing and sort of lightning bolts

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.060 
it's glowing and sort of lightning bolts
and<00:03:01.660> stuff<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.990> there<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.920> kind<00:03:03.040> of

doing a bit of free hand on the Globes
and<00:03:04.720> highlighting<00:03:05.320> up<00:03:05.440> those<00:03:05.620> trailing<00:03:06.190> bits

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
and highlighting up those trailing bits

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.160 
and highlighting up those trailing bits

hazard stripes on it I didn't bother

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.990 
hazard stripes on it I didn't bother
doing<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.720> bit<00:03:16.930> too<00:03:17.110> much<00:03:17.260> work<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
doing that just a bit too much work so I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.520 
doing that just a bit too much work so I
had<00:03:19.480> thought<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> was<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.080> do<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.320> black

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
had thought I was going to do it black

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.470 
had thought I was going to do it black
and<00:03:20.769> add<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.220> stripes<00:03:21.459> later<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:21.970> that's<00:03:22.300> why

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and add the stripes later but that's why

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.420 
and add the stripes later but that's why
I'm<00:03:22.600> kind<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.810> redoing<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.380> base<00:03:23.890> coat<00:03:24.130> at<00:03:24.280> this

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
I'm kind of redoing a base coat at this

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.870 
I'm kind of redoing a base coat at this
point<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> steps<00:03:26.010> ok<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.070> scarce<00:03:27.640> neck

and that's kind of the base colour for
the<00:03:33.910> Goblin<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.510> well<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.959> he<00:03:35.110> gets<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
the Goblin as well so he gets a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.300 
the Goblin as well so he gets a

for the the flesh here that's a kind of
GW<00:03:44.560> starting<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.980> do<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.340> with<00:03:45.580> some<00:03:45.940> other

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.400 
GW starting to do that with some other
it<00:03:46.150> works<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.750> thought<00:03:46.989> I'd<00:03:47.080> give<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.290> a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it works and so I thought I'd give it a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.979 
it works and so I thought I'd give it a
try<00:03:47.620> see<00:03:47.860> what<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.010> looked<00:03:48.160> like

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989

on<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.050> as<00:05:31.230> well<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.650> trying<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.100> make

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
on this as well so just trying to make

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.560 
on this as well so just trying to make
the<00:05:33.090> texture<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.810> little<00:05:34.110> bit<00:05:34.260> more<00:05:34.500> obvious

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
the texture a little bit more obvious

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.170 
the texture a little bit more obvious
and<00:05:36.590> just<00:05:37.590> picking<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:37.950> out<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:38.970> like

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
and just picking that out and then like

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.090 
and just picking that out and then like
I<00:05:39.270> said<00:05:39.300> final<00:05:39.900> highlight<00:05:40.260> there<00:05:40.410> white<00:05:40.740> scar

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
I said final highlight there white scar

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.510 
I said final highlight there white scar
on<00:05:41.360> those<00:05:42.360> orbs<00:05:42.900> some<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:43.950> tubing<00:05:44.460> and

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
on those orbs some of the tubing and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.890 
on those orbs some of the tubing and
stuff<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:44.850> didn't<00:05:45.000> really<00:05:45.210> show<00:05:45.420> because<00:05:45.780> they

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
stuff I didn't really show because they

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.540 
stuff I didn't really show because they
you<00:05:46.320> know<00:05:46.410> it's<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:46.650> one<00:05:46.800> or<00:05:46.920> two<00:05:46.950> colors<00:05:47.400> so

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
you know it's just one or two colors so

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.310 
you know it's just one or two colors so
it's<00:05:47.670> not<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.880> big<00:05:48.090> deal<00:05:48.240> but<00:05:48.720> basically<00:05:49.080> just

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
it's not a big deal but basically just

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.190 
it's not a big deal but basically just
using<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.710> GW<00:05:50.100> paints<00:05:50.490> in<00:05:50.640> their<00:05:51.200> standard

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
using the GW paints in their standard

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.740 
using the GW paints in their standard
base<00:05:52.440> shade<00:05:53.040> highlight<00:05:53.790> highlight<00:05:54.030> kind<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.690> a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
base shade highlight highlight kind of a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.290 
base shade highlight highlight kind of a
look<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.650> here<00:05:55.830> we<00:05:55.920> are<00:05:56.070> all<00:05:56.610> finished<00:05:56.940> a

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
look so here we are all finished a

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.040 
look so here we are all finished a
little<00:05:57.420> bit<00:05:57.630> slower<00:05:57.870> rotation<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.710> see<00:05:58.890> and

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
little bit slower rotation to see and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.960 
little bit slower rotation to see and
yeah<00:06:01.050> very<00:06:01.410> cool<00:06:01.680> model<00:06:02.100> very<00:06:02.340> similar<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.850> the

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
yeah very cool model very similar to the

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.350 
yeah very cool model very similar to the
old<00:06:03.150> Mex<00:06:03.690> shock<00:06:03.930> attack<00:06:04.080> gun<00:06:04.790> which<00:06:05.790> was<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
old Mex shock attack gun which was a

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.150 
old Mex shock attack gun which was a
very<00:06:06.630> neat<00:06:06.840> model<00:06:06.990> but<00:06:07.320> kind<00:06:07.620> of<00:06:07.650> tricky<00:06:08.130> to

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
very neat model but kind of tricky to

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.980 
very neat model but kind of tricky to
put<00:06:08.610> together<00:06:08.730> because<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.150> was<00:06:09.270> originally

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
put together because it was originally

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.210 
put together because it was originally
metal<00:06:10.230> and<00:06:10.380> then<00:06:10.470> fine<00:06:10.740> cast<00:06:11.480> so<00:06:12.480> yeah<00:06:13.220> they

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
metal and then fine cast so yeah they

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.220 
metal and then fine cast so yeah they
are<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> bit<00:06:14.730> closer<00:06:14.970> look<00:06:15.270> on<00:06:15.510> all<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.930> colors

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
are a bit closer look on all the colors

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.130 
are a bit closer look on all the colors
so<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:16.530> did<00:06:16.920> a<00:06:16.950> space<00:06:17.430> wolf<00:06:17.670> gray<00:06:17.970> tunic<00:06:18.810> like

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
so I did a space wolf gray tunic like

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.530 
so I did a space wolf gray tunic like
sort<00:06:19.350> of<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.470> shirt<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:19.890> the<00:06:20.760> the<00:06:21.090> pants<00:06:21.420> are

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
sort of the shirt and the the pants are

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.350 
sort of the shirt and the the pants are
more<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.960> gray<00:06:22.650> with<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.460> Skaven<00:06:24.030> blade

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
more of a gray with the Skaven blade

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.180 
more of a gray with the Skaven blade
Dinge<00:06:24.630> kind<00:06:24.900> of<00:06:24.960> highlight<00:06:25.170> so<00:06:25.410> a<00:06:25.620> couple

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
Dinge kind of highlight so a couple

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.860 
Dinge kind of highlight so a couple
colors<00:06:26.520> are<00:06:26.700> didn't<00:06:26.910> show<00:06:27.090> some<00:06:27.510> checkered

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
colors are didn't show some checkered

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.210 
colors are didn't show some checkered
patterns<00:06:28.230> I<00:06:28.410> think<00:06:28.590> I<00:06:28.650> should<00:06:28.770> probably<00:06:28.920> do<00:06:29.190> a

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
patterns I think I should probably do a

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.150 
patterns I think I should probably do a
tutorial<00:06:29.880> on<00:06:30.150> how<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.360> do<00:06:30.540> checkers<00:06:30.990> on<00:06:31.260> orcs

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
tutorial on how to do checkers on orcs

tutorial on how to do checkers on orcs
it's<00:06:32.340> not<00:06:32.460> that<00:06:32.640> hard<00:06:32.850> once<00:06:33.600> you<00:06:33.690> get<00:06:33.810> the<00:06:33.870> hang

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
it's not that hard once you get the hang

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.080 
it's not that hard once you get the hang
of<00:06:34.050> it<00:06:34.140> and<00:06:34.290> there<00:06:35.250> we<00:06:35.340> go<00:06:35.460> with<00:06:35.640> all<00:06:35.790> the

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
of it and there we go with all the

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.420 
of it and there we go with all the
these<00:06:36.419> images<00:06:36.930> will<00:06:37.230> be<00:06:37.290> on<00:06:37.470> my<00:06:37.650> blog<00:06:38.070> so<00:06:38.400> you

these images will be on my blog so you

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.040 
these images will be on my blog so you
can<00:06:38.580> take<00:06:38.790> a<00:06:38.820> look<00:06:39.000> at<00:06:39.120> them<00:06:39.270> save<00:06:39.540> them<00:06:39.780> or<00:06:39.930> do

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
can take a look at them save them or do

to<00:06:42.870> be<00:06:42.960> there<00:06:43.110> too<00:06:43.260> so<00:06:43.440> you<00:06:43.500> can<00:06:43.620> get<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.740> closer

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
to be there too so you can get a closer
