00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.770
 from berlin so here we just proved 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.710
 on the acer stand so we will 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.450
 presents the iconia w500 10 and 500 to 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.360
 conques the sasson it's just because 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.380
 that there is a 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.570
 that slab and 2 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 other age and degrading which class to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.899
 110 and this one is a tablet that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.899
 runs on windows 8 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 a processor intel jo woerth she is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.050
 we then have a hard drive inside 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.640
 we have 64 gigabytes 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.340
 the thickness is really like a 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.940
 pitbull him mm I can if you see 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.590
 sir for his purposes and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 the tablet itself is six years old 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 that we type 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 and apparently there would be 1 2 two 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 warned we did not find we will try 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.120
 to take pictures of the dock in camera 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.290
 we have a camera in front of 2 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.550
 megapixels and if I find it here a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.320
 8 megapixel camera with a flash 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.580
 and after what is really interesting 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.970
 hundreds of projectiles I make you 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.400
 see where the speaker was 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.270
 until here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.800
 Here is a sim card that these models 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.050
 w500 things here we have a microsd slot a 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.210
 micro usb very convenient that allows you 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.320
 a recharge and transmits and an output 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 mini hdmi the volume knob the jack 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.120
 headphones finally the microphone jack also for 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.190
 the micro sensor there if I turn like 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.220
 that's the reserved part so it must 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.800
 be 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 a proprietary connector and who sees 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.630
 also also be useful for 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.100
 connect a vetch laundry dock so that 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.840
 we explain we are in half home 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.640
 fish theater and bon vivant at 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.170
 on it if I go back here even 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.710
 that's the lock to stop 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 contours the cable 3.5 millimeters for 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.039
 put your headphones and the button 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.770
 pause i 'm going to turn on 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.700
 hope 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.700
 Yes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.480
 these 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.520
 I'm pro b what's going on 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.390
 it's bad 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.049
 My two markets 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.360
 it's not the lock button where you are 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.360
 I am here 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.880
 the captain 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.620
 to the point that of messing around 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.120
 this is always the same model I 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.290
 reassures you 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.190
 so obviously this kind of case is 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.550
 almost as models of 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.760
 demonstration to the windows button here which 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.390
 allows you to switch from mode 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.120
 from application to office mode the trick is 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.890
 well it's hot it's here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.710
 we can install windows software 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.290
 we use it as 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.820
 a classic windows seven that 's it 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.810
 nice you see you have them 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.860
 managers of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.860
 file does not exist here 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.349
 a cock there on 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.349
 the office suite that integrated 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.220
 these have our little ones a little girl 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.690
 of 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.540
 developed by a deer of these women and to 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.150
 those rings that we've already seen on 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.360
 it is a painting 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.360
 Yes 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.160
 see that this is the small system of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.440
 of acer who is really very nice 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.560
 and that you words 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.560
 Yes 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.060
 tailored to your needs it is completely 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.910
 adapted the looks nice the video here and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.520
 brothers 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.570
 if the browser 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.570
 sp no internet connection 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 press 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.460
 so among the other elections 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.630
 so you have part 2 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.600
 shit ya just leaned on these 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.960
 and after all that is 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.960
 applications for example 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.710
 it's not trivial 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.430
 it's no reason 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.110
 do not have to zoom 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.110
 it's not true what are you saying about it 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.699
 if we could kill her 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.590
 I go back and the stocks 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.450
 So here we are, this is a deer w510 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.000
 and you have model project in w will be 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.080
 so a windows 8 tablet 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.080
 from a century
