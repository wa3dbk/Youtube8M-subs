twigs
transy<00:00:25.279> sure<00:00:27.160> so<00:00:28.160> basically<00:00:29.619> it's<00:00:30.619> really

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
transy sure so basically it's really

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.780

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.719 
delete this right so basically what I do
is<00:01:14.390> about<00:01:15.320> ten<00:01:15.860> frames<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.340> want<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.550> go<00:01:16.670> to

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
is about ten frames so you want to go to

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.880 
is about ten frames so you want to go to
the<00:01:16.880> end<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.119> first<00:01:17.330> clip<00:01:17.630> count<00:01:18.619> ten

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the end of the first clip count ten

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.870 
the end of the first clip count ten
flames<00:01:19.190> in<00:01:19.630> our<00:01:20.630> back<00:01:21.409> even<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.670> want<00:01:22.790> to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
flames in our back even you want to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.060 
flames in our back even you want to
split<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.540> don't<00:01:23.810> see<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> same<00:01:24.229> for<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
split it you don't see the same for the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.270 
split it you don't see the same for the
video<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.299> bottom<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:27.170> from<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.040> start

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
video on the bottom just from the start

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.010 
video on the bottom just from the start
so<00:01:29.920> ten<00:01:30.920> split<00:01:31.820> then<00:01:32.119> what<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.299> want<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.540> do<00:01:32.750> is

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
so ten split then what you want to do is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.980 
so ten split then what you want to do is
overlap<00:01:33.830> these<00:01:34.070> two<00:01:34.509> exactly<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.570> same<00:01:35.689> times

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
overlap these two exactly the same times

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.649 
overlap these two exactly the same times
you<00:01:36.380> don't<00:01:36.470> want<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.799> get<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.310> first<00:01:38.180> flip<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
you don't want to get the first flip the

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.740 
you don't want to get the first flip the
top<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.920> be<00:01:40.130> fading<00:01:40.549> out<00:01:40.700> for<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.600> whole

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
top one to be fading out for the whole

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.350 
top one to be fading out for the whole
thing<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.290> bottom<00:01:43.189> one<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.430> be<00:01:43.520> fading<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
thing and bottom one to be fading in the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.780 
thing and bottom one to be fading in the
fade<00:01:44.600> type<00:01:44.840> does<00:01:45.170> not<00:01:45.200> matter<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.549> can<00:01:46.579> you

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
fade type does not matter you can you

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.840 
fade type does not matter you can you
use<00:01:46.939> any<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.360> these<00:01:48.340> then<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.610> want<00:01:49.759> to

file<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.740> drag<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:58.280> onto<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.670> clip<00:01:59.299> ten<00:02:00.110> frames

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
file on drag it onto the clip ten frames

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.910 
file on drag it onto the clip ten frames
I<00:02:00.710> was<00:02:01.420> really<00:02:02.420> quite<00:02:03.049> strong<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.710> only

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
I was really quite strong so you only

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.499 
I was really quite strong so you only
one<00:02:04.100> are<00:02:04.189> going<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.369> put<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.610> about<00:02:04.759> around

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
one are going to put it about around

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.050 
one are going to put it about around
three<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.130> amount<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:07.790> bother

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
three and the amount don't bother

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.030 
three and the amount don't bother
changing<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.600> angle<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:09.019> can<00:02:09.290> just<00:02:09.829> make<00:02:10.009> it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
changing the angle that can just make it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.030 
changing the angle that can just make it
look<00:02:10.820> weird<00:02:11.380> then<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.470> do<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> same<00:02:12.799> for<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
look weird then you do the same for the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.650 
look weird then you do the same for the
bottom<00:02:13.220> one

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
bottom one

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.520 
bottom one
but<00:02:15.200> about<00:02:15.790> three<00:02:16.960> doesn't<00:02:17.960> really<00:02:18.200> need<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
but about three doesn't really need to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.550 
but about three doesn't really need to
be<00:02:18.620> exact<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.100> anything<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.690> should<00:02:21.320> be

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
be exact to anything and that should be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.030 
be exact to anything and that should be
it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.530 

so<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.430> really<00:02:26.860> yeah

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
so that's it really yeah

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.930 
so that's it really yeah
so<00:02:29.540> use<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.020> video<00:02:30.230> noise<00:02:30.650> montages<00:02:31.430> stuff

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
so use this video noise montages stuff

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.920 
so use this video noise montages stuff
and<00:02:32.210> I'll<00:02:33.080> see<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> next<00:02:33.680> video
