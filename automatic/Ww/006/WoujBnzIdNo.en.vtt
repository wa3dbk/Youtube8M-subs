what<00:01:42.440> it's<00:01:42.560> bad<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:43.759> really<00:01:44.240> sucks

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.510 

ficient<00:01:47.870> sometimes<00:01:48.260> I<00:01:48.620> think<00:01:49.070> could<00:01:49.370> be<00:01:49.400> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
ficient sometimes I think could be a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.860 
ficient sometimes I think could be a
dying<00:01:49.880> breed<00:01:51.640> well<00:01:52.640> lobsters<00:01:53.480> don't<00:01:53.600> stay

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
dying breed well lobsters don't stay

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.480 
dying breed well lobsters don't stay
good<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.140> guess<00:01:54.320> off<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.650> go<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.800> college<00:01:55.220> they

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
good I guess off to go to college they

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.990 
good I guess off to go to college they
haven't<00:01:55.790> experienced<00:01:56.450> any<00:01:57.290> bad<00:01:58.190> times<00:01:58.490> none
