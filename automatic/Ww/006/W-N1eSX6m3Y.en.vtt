00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
gunfights I will use toughness this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
gunfights I will use toughness this
gives<00:01:20.189> me<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> much<00:01:20.850> better<00:01:20.880> chance<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> winning

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
gives me a much better chance of winning

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780

a<00:01:21.900> gunfight<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.830> weapon<00:01:23.220> won't<00:01:23.400> sway

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
a gunfight because my weapon won't sway

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
a gunfight because my weapon won't sway
while<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.150> getting<00:01:24.299> shot<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> gunfight

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
while I'm getting shot in a gunfight

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
while I'm getting shot in a gunfight
making<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:26.009> chances<00:01:26.520> better<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.090> win<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
making my chances better to win the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.789 
making my chances better to win the
gunfight<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> enemy<00:01:28.590> isn't

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
gunfight because if the enemy isn't

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
gunfight because if the enemy isn't
using<00:01:29.220> toughness<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.909> he's<00:01:30.210> likely<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.869> have

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
using toughness then he's likely to have

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
using toughness then he's likely to have
a<00:01:31.049> hard<00:01:31.320> time<00:01:31.590> staying<00:01:31.890> locked<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.610> his

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
a hard time staying locked on to his

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
a hard time staying locked on to his
target<00:01:32.970> which<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.420> why<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> believe<00:01:34.079> toughness

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
target which is why I believe toughness

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.410 
target which is why I believe toughness
helps<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> be

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
helps you out so much if you want to be

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
helps you out so much if you want to be
aggressive<00:01:36.659> here's<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> optional<00:01:38.100> part<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
aggressive here's the optional part and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
aggressive here's the optional part and
it<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.909> depends<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.540> preference<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it really depends on your preference I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
it really depends on your preference I
would<00:01:40.470> also<00:01:40.860> equip<00:01:41.310> blast<00:01:41.909> suppressor

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
would also equip blast suppressor

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
would also equip blast suppressor
because<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.049> being<00:01:43.290> aggressive<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> I'm

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
because if I'm being aggressive and I'm

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
because if I'm being aggressive and I'm
being<00:01:44.549> pinged<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.450> radar<00:01:45.869> from<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.229> boost

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
being pinged on the radar from my boost

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
being pinged on the radar from my boost
jump<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> dashing<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.729> smarter<00:01:48.149> players

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
jump and dashing then smarter players

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
jump and dashing then smarter players
will<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> able<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> flank<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.740> chase<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
will be able to flank you or chase you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
will be able to flank you or chase you
down<00:01:50.340> since<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.759> location<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> exposed

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
down since your location is exposed

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
down since your location is exposed
which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> why<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:53.159> typically<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.700> blaah

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
which is why I would typically use blaah

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
which is why I would typically use blaah
suppressor<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.869> I'll<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.200> pick<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
suppressor and I'll just pick up a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
suppressor and I'll just pick up a
weapon<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.159> case<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> run<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> ammo<00:01:57.299> now

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
weapon in case I run out of ammo now

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
weapon in case I run out of ammo now
like<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> said<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.259> optional<00:01:58.619> used<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
like I said it is optional used what you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
like I said it is optional used what you
want<00:01:59.939> maybe<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> use<00:02:00.719> scavenger<00:02:01.530> or

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
want maybe you want to use scavenger or

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
want maybe you want to use scavenger or
hardwired<00:02:02.430> instead<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> blast<00:02:03.390> suppressor<00:02:03.540> do

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
hardwired instead of blast suppressor do

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.569 
hardwired instead of blast suppressor do
what<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> feel<00:02:04.590> comfortable<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
what you feel comfortable with then I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
what you feel comfortable with then I
use<00:02:05.909> overclock<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.750> two<00:02:06.930> things

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
use overclock for two things

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.260 
use overclock for two things
one<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.039> helps<00:02:08.220> me<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.819> tight<00:02:09.060> situations

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
one it helps me out in tight situations

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.499 
one it helps me out in tight situations
because<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.140> could

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
because I could

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.080 
because I could
zip<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.959> out<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.200> gunfights<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.040> -<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.790> helps

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
zip on out of gunfights and - it helps

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.880 
zip on out of gunfights and - it helps
me<00:02:13.209> chase<00:02:13.450> down<00:02:13.629> enemies<00:02:13.900> quicker<00:02:14.319> or<00:02:14.620> even

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
me chase down enemies quicker or even

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.589 
me chase down enemies quicker or even
get<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.250> objective<00:02:15.370> faster<00:02:16.269> which<00:02:16.450> would

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
get to the objective faster which would

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.330 
get to the objective faster which would
help<00:02:16.750> me<00:02:16.959> earn<00:02:17.049> my<00:02:17.200> scorestreaks<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.189> here's
