00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.289

 thank you very much for joining us many 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.280
 thank you we love to be here we are going to 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.199
 shove goalkeeper cancel your play no 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.330
 I play a lot of sport was made active 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.150
 the first penalty made practically 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.299
 this world as from which approach what 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.869
 are you watching as a footballer like people 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:59.150
 of means that you see this world that 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.860
 you look when you see the world watch what 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.530
 first and I have to be very frank is 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.260
 that I did not suppose that Mexico was going to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 to get Mexico was not in condition 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.799
 to classify 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.549
 once mexico classifies I was 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.870
 convinced and peeled and fought that was crown 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.380
 who had to be in it 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.730
 and after seeing a lot doing the great 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.620
 action that he did because you have to 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.070
 recognize him he did incredibly well 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.690
 I retract from my saying Mexico exceeded 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.600
 the expectations that we all had 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.170
 regarding the performance having seen it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 getting a good draw and giving the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 battle in front of brazil and having done 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 what he did in his first meeting 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.350
 because if you loaded on crown that 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.210
 I saw that crown or you went with 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.040
 crown because you did not see so much and so 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.130
 followed by a lot of looks 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.460
 there are several reasons I'm going to the blue cross 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.460
 to get started 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.470
 not the blue cross 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 it seems to me that crown have some 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.190
 qualities that you have to have in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 goal has a lot of personality is a 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.940
 powder keg has a very short wick that does not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 it helps him but he 's a guy with a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 directive personality as there is 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.220
 have to be facing long and to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 have the complete vision of the field 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 being behind memo eighta it seems to me that 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.350
 it's a softer type but it has turned out 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.030
 be a character who did it very well 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.670
 everyone says clear, they fell 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.230
 the balls if you're well standing and you know 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.040
 bail the balls are going to hit you 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.840
 on the chest 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.940
 what I just said very interesting and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.880
 they want because that many people say ah 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.709
 is that he was very lucky not the goalkeepers 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.670
 they are not lucky the goalkeepers have 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.630
 placement bravery reflex location 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.250
 They know who cross his bow to you 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.340
 He taught who told you something else 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.380
 improved in your position of goalkeeper yo 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.360
 I started as a very young caretaker. I started 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.569
 the 7 years in some dirt courts that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.420
 They were near my house 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.370
 because my dad was a super football fan and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.409
 when he saw that he had two daughters he was 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.659
 it shattered the heart until it appeared 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.939
 like a goat in glassware and very for 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.799
 grind to then I play soccer from very 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.629
 girl I have on my knees made 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.209
 pieces I have several fingers that have 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.549
 gone through multiple fractures my hands 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.139
 of goalkeeper if that is not done that does not 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.609
 if it is a compliment making a woman but 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.219
 good humans is a compliment for a 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.719
 people that the tree 5 this I do not have some 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.200
 aesthetic hands but I have some hands 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.169
 functional and I know how to navigate the area well 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.239
 the broken a pair of legs things of what 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.510
 I do not feel very proud but I see 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.030
 in memo qualities that I say then of course 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.549
 the guy is doing what he knows how to do 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.340
 and he's clearly very well trained what 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.480
 think about what happened yesterday Spain 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.090
 I think it's dramatic I think that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.569
 football has no word of honor and the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.709
 proof is that the world champion is 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.780
 outside and it's out in a way 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.310
 humiliating and regrettable and with whom you 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.560
 you stay then now but it is that it is 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.780
 still outside of Mexico I imagine 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.140
 that Mexico gives you possibilities of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.410
 continue not to follow us then I think 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.299
 that you have it very complicated or 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.599
 play against croatia is not going to be 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.090
 simple croatia is bound to win 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.349
 mexico can tie I hope they do not throw 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.959
 the truck back because that would be 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.970
 dramatic I hope they give a good football 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.840
 and to show that they can play a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.190
 party more no I do not have sympathy for 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.350
 germany but I think germany is a 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.810
 very strong team and in the pool 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.610
 of the gymnasium also came out German either 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.530
 you'd better luck today sadder 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.410
 since he played a team that has many 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.150
 possibilities and I get to touch 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.850
 honduras we are fried 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.950
 I wish brazil the truth is that what I'm going 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.830
 to say is not politically correct 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.630
 but brazil I do not like 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.900
 I hope Brazil does not reach the final 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.360
 although it is as easy or normal as 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.740
 always this green book this brasil me 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.320
 it seems very left over we were not 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.210
 agreement I do not like this brazil and the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.250
 circumstances in which Brazil is 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.640
 I do not like messi or playing 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.640
 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.539
 football that month and I think 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.240
 who has some outstanding skills 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.639
 and Christian Ronaldo is very stopped in 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.080
 the figurine and in the image and I feel 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.690
 physically does not have much to brag about 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.039
 so he just plays soccer if yes 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.510
 I would have been to Brazil and what stage 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:30.390
 what team would you have liked to follow 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.810
 is that cheat Carlos because now 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.730
 I already have the history and the background 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.430
 at this time I would have liked to continue 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.550
 talking of course 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.280
 because a team that gets 5 goals and 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.390
 overwhelm the world champion is a 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.390
 equipment that you have to follow closely 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.210
 to the English the football of the English 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.460
 I like the Italians me very bad fall 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.050
 but they have a football is football is 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.450
 football you have time with everything 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.860
 do you are a producer driver you write 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.960
 books you play soccer you see now little 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.940
 I have a story I saw a lot 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.370
 I used to go to the stadium a lot 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.640
 blue cross went to the blue and then I went to the 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.950
 villamelón or vice versa yes so I see 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.920
 I see football now I'm a little bit 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.780
 away from Mexican soccer football 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.850
 mexican football in general the truth 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.450
 is that I prefer to play soccer that 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.430
 it seems much more pleasurable than seeing it and 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.830
 with the people who have to play the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.600
 soccer with your teammates with football 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.510
 They are also a friendship of stays in 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.160
 small groups as in the insurance is done 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.250
 it makes a lot of body spirit because you're 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.960
 there on the court giving them 90 more minutes 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.880
 you have good relationship with your 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.130
 defense because yes no 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.060
 are you in front of seeing what it implies then 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.560
 which one will be the world champion 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.750
 I think I think it's going to be Brazil 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.840
 even though I do not like it when I 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.850
 They ask how Mexico is going to go 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.449
 I want it to go as I want it to 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.180
 go to mexico or what is my prognosis 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.789
 with history the background I think 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.099
 Brazil is bound by the 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.559
 circumstances for the amount of money 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:16.719
 that he got into this world cup more 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:19.059
 It is worth winning because if there is not going to be a 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:27.009
 complex social revolt more than what 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:30.669
 is already making the last one to go 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:32.409
 correcting to see where we are taking 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.839
