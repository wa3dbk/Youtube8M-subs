00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
use my fluid head I've also learned a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
use my fluid head I've also learned a
neat<00:00:27.300> trick<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.170> know<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> put<00:00:28.619> a

neat trick that you you know you put a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
neat trick that you you know you put a
rubber<00:00:28.920> band<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.300> of

and I attached it to the top got my rode
pistol<00:00:46.440> grip<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.690> I'm

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
pistol grip on here and this is my I'm

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
pistol grip on here and this is my I'm
cage<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.800> six<00:00:50.070> shotgun<00:00:50.730> mic<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.210> can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
cage for one six shotgun mic I can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.910 
cage for one six shotgun mic I can
record<00:00:52.350> audio<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.620> you're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
record audio with and so if you're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
record audio with and so if you're
curious<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.699> rail<00:00:56.850> system<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
curious about the rail system this is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
curious about the rail system this is
actually<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> native<00:00:58.739> rail<00:00:59.039> system<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually not the native rail system I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
actually not the native rail system I
switched<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.530> because<00:01:01.530> those<00:01:01.859> rails

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
switched this out because those rails

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.090 
switched this out because those rails
that<00:01:02.579> came<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.809> too<00:01:04.350> short

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that came with it were a bit too short

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
that came with it were a bit too short
so<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> fog<00:01:08.090> DP<00:01:09.090> 500<00:01:09.840> fog<00:01:10.110> ATP<00:01:10.560> 500

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so these are the fog DP 500 fog ATP 500

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.810 
so these are the fog DP 500 fog ATP 500
right<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:12.619> why<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
right there why I really like these is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
right there why I really like these is
because<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> came<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.159> support<00:01:17.159> system

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because it came with this support system

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
because it came with this support system
right<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> lens<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
right here for your lens and what that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.850 
right here for your lens and what that
helps<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.360> guys<00:01:21.540> ever<00:01:21.780> tried<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.380> put

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
drop this right now

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
drop this right now
if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> touch<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> front<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> kind

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
if you touch the front it kind of kind

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
if you touch the front it kind of kind
of<00:01:35.040> vibrates<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
of vibrates and you really see that in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
of vibrates and you really see that in
your<00:01:37.110> picture<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> take<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.759> support

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
your picture so if you take this support

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.450 
your picture so if you take this support
system<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.140> pick<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
system and you pick it up and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.139 
system and you pick it up and
righty-tighty<00:01:42.090> lefty-loosey<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey and you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey and you
support<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
support it now you don't get that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
support it now you don't get that
vibration<00:01:47.549> anymore<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.810> neat

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
vibration anymore so this is really neat

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.249 
vibration anymore so this is really neat
and<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.799> feels<00:01:50.070> super<00:01:50.490> solid<00:01:51.079> very<00:01:52.079> nice

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and this all feels super solid very nice

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.679 
and this all feels super solid very nice
now<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> did<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:55.040> put<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
now what I did on the back here put this

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.459 
now what I did on the back here put this
clamp<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> attaches<00:01:59.630> to<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> ball

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
clamp on here that attaches to this ball

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.800 
clamp on here that attaches to this ball
