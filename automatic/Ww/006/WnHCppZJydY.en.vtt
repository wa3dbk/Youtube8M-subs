00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
so I'm going to show you now how to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.210 
so I'm going to show you now how to
create<00:00:06.240> beachy<00:00:06.930> waves<00:00:07.140> using<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.649> flat<00:00:07.919> iron

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
create beachy waves using a flat iron

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.980 
create beachy waves using a flat iron
this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> really<00:00:09.120> really<00:00:09.240> great<00:00:09.450> technique

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this is a really really great technique

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.810 
this is a really really great technique
if<00:00:10.170> your<00:00:10.380> hair<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.679> similar<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.429> models

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
if your hair is similar to my models

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
if your hair is similar to my models
this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.870> our<00:00:12.990> natural<00:00:13.200> kind<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> wavy<00:00:13.889> texture

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this is our natural kind of wavy texture

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.220 
this is our natural kind of wavy texture
it's<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> bump<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it's just a way to bump that up to the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.040 
it's just a way to bump that up to the
next<00:00:16.440> level<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.029> less<00:00:18.449> wavy<00:00:18.840> hair

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
next level or if you have less wavy hair

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
next level or if you have less wavy hair
maybe<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.619> has<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> big<00:00:20.130> solid<00:00:20.820> bump

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
maybe it just has a big solid bump

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.730 
maybe it just has a big solid bump
through<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.750> would<00:00:22.170> definitely<00:00:22.470> start<00:00:22.680> with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
through I would definitely start with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
through I would definitely start with
that<00:00:22.980> texture<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:23.910> build<00:00:24.180> upon<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that texture it and then build upon it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.630 
that texture it and then build upon it
it's<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.830> good<00:00:25.980> because<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
it's really good because it's going to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.670 
it's really good because it's going to
add<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.150> more<00:00:27.359> consistency<00:00:27.930> so

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
add a little bit more consistency so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.870 
add a little bit more consistency so
what<00:00:29.039> you're<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> you're<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
gonna just go in and I hook probably

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.100 
gonna just go in and I hook probably
little<00:00:34.260> inch<00:00:35.000> long<00:00:36.000> sections

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
little inch long sections

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.619 
little inch long sections
I<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:38.040> already<00:00:38.309> prepped<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> models<00:00:39.360> hair

will say be careful with this with your
hands<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.670> does<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.119> warm<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hands because it does get pretty warm so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
after you feel like you've warmed it you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
after you feel like you've warmed it you
just<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> hold<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.520> hand<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> cool

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just kind of hold it in my hand to cool

this<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.470> great<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.100> curl<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> I'm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
this really great little curl so I'm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
this really great little curl so I'm
just<00:01:28.500> gonna<00:01:28.590> continue<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just gonna continue to do that but it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
just gonna continue to do that but it's
gonna<00:01:30.420> end<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.750> doing<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.200> her<00:01:31.350> hair<00:01:31.590> because

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
gonna end up doing for her hair because

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 
gonna end up doing for her hair because
it's<00:01:32.700> already<00:01:32.939> got<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> natural<00:01:33.509> wave<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's already got a natural wave to it is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
it's already got a natural wave to it is
it's<00:01:34.409> gonna<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.860> look<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.549> more

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it's gonna make it look like it's more

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.450 
it's gonna make it look like it's more
wavy<00:01:36.119> than<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.070> gonna<00:01:38.159> keep

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
wavy than it is so I'm just gonna keep

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
wavy than it is so I'm just gonna keep
doing<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> taking<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.630> sections<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.680> hold

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
doing that taking little sections I hold

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.899 
doing that taking little sections I hold
on<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> ends<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.310> then<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> press<00:01:44.880> my

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
on to the ends and then I just press my

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.840 
on to the ends and then I just press my
flat<00:01:45.390> iron<00:01:45.540> through<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.079> start<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.590> side

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
flat iron through it I start on one side

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.679 
flat iron through it I start on one side
so<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.390> hold<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.289 

so<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.380> would<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:53.590> continue<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.640> around<00:01:54.939> the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
so I would just continue this around the

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.649 
so I would just continue this around the
head<00:01:56.249> depending<00:01:57.249> on<00:01:57.640> what<00:01:58.210> your<00:01:58.479> natural

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
head depending on what your natural
