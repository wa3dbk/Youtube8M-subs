00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 is about the koala powder find the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.010
 koala brother a funny tv series 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.170
 about 2k games your friends in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.160
 You do not want to help Australia 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.730
 just thanks just start going on here 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.619
 Are savings for the right one whom I 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290
 play with the cuboid flight taxi the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.410
 pasta and her friends 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 just that we need to help and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 always ask in a partner as never 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.620
 play and we start at george and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.620
 Agent us with 4 2 through 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.890
 George blamed the turtles 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.070
 I have chosen the way postman 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.520
 his letters are lost ok and the koalas 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.079
 again with your airplane you have to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.079
 capture letters again 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.810
 So the games is not serious 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.520
 together not very long if we 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 in a party game makes a mini 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 but make a small project 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.090
 I would like to play this game again 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.780
 expose because I already have the game 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.189
 not played for a long time and me 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.900
 wanted to expose again and I have 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.560
 I thought now rather new play 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.869
 pending 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.420
 that just made it there 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 several levels and this time you have to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.780
 seems to dodge on this rock and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.270
 hence your settlement with your house 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 weeks with bad lives and net 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.619
 caravan next to it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.409
 it is probably soon, at least in the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.880
 series 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.340
 i still have the brits though 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.149
 although maybe I am all kinds 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.509
 ok also to friends nice 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 watch out 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:09.390
 okay, up there is our energy 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:12.229
 op make I will'm pretty 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.229
 can come 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.900
 ok I have I managed 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.540
 no matter here but have had enough 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.540
 space 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.400
 that's how full energy is again 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.190
 Well 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.959
 not that is not so easy 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:49.880
 Here they sing easier in memory 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:51.500
 so probably now by me 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.170
 hope there are still quiet 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.950
 there is a human being the weather now 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.950
 really hard 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.730
 at the moment an ok one is still missing and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.730
 maybe there is one more 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.190
 Okay, so that can be done by many 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.709
 ask 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 because it is so fast you will have the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.030
 next game a helping hand 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.709
 ok samy the hedgehogs place and his 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.430
 Delivery van appears the food 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.430
 drop 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 OK 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.409
 its location 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.380
 I can still remember the game 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:54.670
 okay we have to pick it up 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.580
 Quite a bit faster already 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.850
 made 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.850
 b 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.130
 OK 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.220
 wars are always on his shop 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.510
 yet just go just so far 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.410
 Why are the friends actually throwing him 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.410
 to eat things 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.200
 the penguin had cloned 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.539
 red 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.970
 the goal is it looks a bit like 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.070
 cuts here but can also be an end 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.600
 his 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:34.930
 the crocodile george the postman think 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.600
 you already play family game immediately and 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.259

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:50.820
 think so 15 something films for less 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.820
 they will not get the food anymore 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.440

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:09.959

 but anyway so sorry or not 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:15.479
 Michael Pickel accuracy asked at 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.479

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:36.500
 comnet helps me, why can I do it? 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:36.500
 then did not create this time now 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.189
 Here, the new ship is best completely 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.529
 close to it 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.529
 at the moment I have to call about 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.350
 I think I have to work 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:03.009
 there please now is not easy though 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:09.599
 no matter the 1 I have to catch now yes 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:12.629
 please done sap is okay next 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:15.580
 but it does not seem against the 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:18.340
 the construction site goes without any if we 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.120
 more and more shopping bags okay like one 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.479
 carpet 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:27.270
 At the end comes a 1 where you collect as 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.270
 I have to be careful 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:40.529
 that's what men are 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:40.529
 thrown the ditch 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:54.540
 okay also get so oil can to to 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:00.090
 assistant bad alright though i have 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:01.940
 a long part of a certain moment 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.940
 were not on a concrete now 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.940
 date 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.550
 so exactly 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.860
 nice to watch that 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:20.230
 nice to have recovered anyway with me 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.880
 he managed to please but very satisfied 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.150
 you actually name them here in the game 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:31.150
 It does not sound okay 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:33.310
 We still have these games 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.470
 many okay but i would say so 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.230
 always make two games namely propane 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.270
 and do the next part 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.620
 the saviors are what was that because 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.720
 they are not as accurate in a 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.700
 appartement in the next lot are yes 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.700
 see you next time and bye
