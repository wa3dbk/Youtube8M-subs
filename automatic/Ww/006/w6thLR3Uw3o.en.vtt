00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.480 

so<00:00:11.140> far<00:00:11.350> we<00:00:11.530> have<00:00:11.620> seen<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:12.040> geometry

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
so far we have seen the geometry

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.060 
so far we have seen the geometry
construction<00:00:13.060> that<00:00:13.270> allows<00:00:13.570> us<00:00:13.600> to<00:00:14.080> find<00:00:14.920> the

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
construction that allows us to find the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.510 
construction that allows us to find the
square<00:00:15.430> roots<00:00:15.670> of

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
square roots of

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.240 
square roots of
numbers<00:00:16.880> but<00:00:17.810> it<00:00:18.050> was<00:00:18.230> a<00:00:18.440> recursive<00:00:19.070> process

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
numbers but it was a recursive process

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.610 
numbers but it was a recursive process
that<00:00:20.000> is<00:00:20.180> to<00:00:20.390> know<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.930> square<00:00:21.200> root<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.560> a

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 
that is to know the square root of a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.100 
that is to know the square root of a
given<00:00:21.980> natural<00:00:22.130> number<00:00:22.670> it<00:00:23.240> was<00:00:23.450> necessary<00:00:24.020> to

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
given natural number it was necessary to

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.140 
given natural number it was necessary to
know<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.560> square<00:00:24.830> root<00:00:25.010> of<00:00:25.190> the<00:00:25.340> previous<00:00:25.970> one

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
know the square root of the previous one

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.990 
know the square root of the previous one
now<00:00:26.360> we<00:00:27.350> are<00:00:27.590> going<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:27.980> look<00:00:28.100> at<00:00:28.310> another

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
now we are going to look at another

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.050 
now we are going to look at another
construction<00:00:29.540> which<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.810> more<00:00:30.170> powerful<00:00:30.619> and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
construction which is more powerful and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.240 
construction which is more powerful and
direct<00:00:32.060> as<00:00:32.239> well<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.500> will<00:00:33.620> allow<00:00:33.800> us<00:00:34.070> to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
direct as well so it will allow us to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.660 
direct as well so it will allow us to
find<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:35.120> one<00:00:35.480> step<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.620> square<00:00:36.950> root<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.430> an

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
find in one step the square root of an

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.160 
find in one step the square root of an
arbitrary<00:00:38.510> number<00:00:38.780> say<00:00:39.559> 3.14<00:00:40.780> this<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.930> based

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
arbitrary number say 3.14 this is based

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.970 
arbitrary number say 3.14 this is based
on<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.590> geometric<00:00:42.800> property<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.809> similarity

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
on the geometric property of similarity

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.030 
on the geometric property of similarity
similarity<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.730> nothing<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:47.480> scaling<00:00:48.140> either

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
similarity is nothing but scaling either

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.979 
similarity is nothing but scaling either
scaling<00:00:49.400> down<00:00:49.610> or<00:00:49.850> scaling<00:00:50.090> up<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.450> a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
scaling down or scaling up of a

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.170 
scaling down or scaling up of a
geometric<00:00:51.290> figure<00:00:51.680> for<00:00:52.010> example<00:00:52.430> here<00:00:53.000> we

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
geometric figure for example here we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.350 
geometric figure for example here we
have<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.570> triangle<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:55.399> have<00:00:55.520> scaled<00:00:55.970> it<00:00:56.210> up

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
have a triangle and we have scaled it up

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.850 
have a triangle and we have scaled it up
by<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.200> factor<00:00:57.800> say<00:00:58.090> 1.5<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.660> then<00:01:00.590> once

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
by the factor say 1.5 and then once

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130 
by the factor say 1.5 and then once
again<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:01.790> are<00:01:01.820> screwing<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.300> scale<00:01:02.540> up<00:01:02.690> by<00:01:03.079> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
again we are screwing to scale up by the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.910 
again we are screwing to scale up by the
same<00:01:03.470> factor<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.489> get<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:04.850> third<00:01:05.300> triangle

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
same factor to get this third triangle

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.190 
same factor to get this third triangle
now<00:01:06.920> if<00:01:07.190> we<00:01:07.369> take<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.850> corresponding<00:01:08.200> lengths

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
now if we take the corresponding lengths

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.440 
now if we take the corresponding lengths
of<00:01:09.320> these<00:01:09.770> three<00:01:10.009> triangles<00:01:10.310> say<00:01:10.670> these<00:01:10.880> green

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
of these three triangles say these green

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.450 
of these three triangles say these green
lengths<00:01:11.840> 16<00:01:12.530> 24<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.729> 36<00:01:14.500> then<00:01:15.500> they<00:01:15.800> bear<00:01:16.160> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
lengths 16 24 and 36 then they bear the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.840 
lengths 16 24 and 36 then they bear the
same<00:01:16.790> ratio<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.310> therefore<00:01:19.310> they're<00:01:19.700> in

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
same ratio and therefore they're in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.050 
same ratio and therefore they're in
proportion<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> say<00:01:21.020> 16<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.009> 2<00:01:22.310> 24<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.649> 24<00:01:24.649> is

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
proportion so to say 16 is 2 24 is 24 is

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.460 
proportion so to say 16 is 2 24 is 24 is
236

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
236

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.440 
236
such<00:01:27.470> triplet<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.190> numbers<00:01:28.580> is<00:01:28.759> said<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.090> be<00:01:29.209> in

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
such triplet of numbers is said to be in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.230 
such triplet of numbers is said to be in
geometric<00:01:29.690> progression<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.850> middle

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
geometric progression and the middle

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.699 
geometric progression and the middle
number<00:01:32.740> can<00:01:33.740> be<00:01:33.920> had<00:01:34.220> as<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.600> square<00:01:36.110> root<00:01:36.380> as

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
number can be had as the square root as

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.520 
number can be had as the square root as
shown<00:01:37.009> here<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:38.240> product<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.289> first

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
shown here of the product of the first

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.100 
shown here of the product of the first
and<00:01:39.860> last<00:01:39.920> number<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:40.610> 16<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:41.539> first<00:01:41.750> number

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
and last number so 16 the first number

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.919 
and last number so 16 the first number
multiplied<00:01:42.890> by<00:01:42.979> 36<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.640> last<00:01:43.880> number<00:01:44.270> will

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
multiplied by 36 the last number will

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.730 
multiplied by 36 the last number will
give<00:01:45.140> us<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.679> square<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:46.099> 24<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.410> that's<00:01:48.410> the

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
give us the square of 24 and that's the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.609 
give us the square of 24 and that's the
root<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.700> can<00:01:49.729> take<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.690> find<00:01:50.959> square<00:01:51.319> roots

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
root we can take to find square roots

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.830 
root we can take to find square roots
now<00:01:52.429> such<00:01:52.880> triplets<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.630> geometric

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
now such triplets in geometric

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.919 
now such triplets in geometric
progression<00:01:54.590> can<00:01:55.160> be<00:01:55.369> had<00:01:55.580> using<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.539> angle

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
progression can be had using right angle

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.219 
progression can be had using right angle
triangles<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.520> we'll<00:01:58.819> start<00:01:59.119> with<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.990> one

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
triangles so we'll start with this one

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.160 
triangles so we'll start with this one
over<00:02:00.410> here<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:00.950> we<00:02:01.729> are<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.149> rotate<00:02:02.929> it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
over here and we are going to rotate it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.419 
over here and we are going to rotate it
so<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.940> this<00:02:05.240> base<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.289> triangle<00:02:06.530> comes

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
so that this base of the triangle comes

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.990 
so that this base of the triangle comes
an<00:02:07.729> alliance<00:02:08.300> with<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.050> height<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.000> then

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
an alliance with the height of it then

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.449 
an alliance with the height of it then
we<00:02:11.180> are<00:02:11.209> going<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.569> scale<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.530> copy<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.340> we

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
we are going to scale this copy that we

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.110 
we are going to scale this copy that we
just<00:02:13.640> made<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.530> point<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
just made about this point so that the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.960 
just made about this point so that the
height<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.020> copy<00:02:18.310> becomes<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.489> same<00:02:19.730> as

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
height of the copy becomes the same as

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.630 
height of the copy becomes the same as
the<00:02:20.630> original<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.860> now<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.069> have<00:02:22.310> 2

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the original so now we have 2

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.890 
the original so now we have 2
right-angled<00:02:23.120> triangles<00:02:23.630> which<00:02:23.780> are

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
right-angled triangles which are

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.540 
right-angled triangles which are

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
necessarily similar because they are

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.540 
necessarily similar because they are
just<00:02:25.760> rotated<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.450> scaled

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
just rotated and scaled

and they had the same height now the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.060 
and they had the same height now the
base<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.430> car<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:34.240> triangle<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.860> this

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
base of the car this triangle then this

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.610 
base of the car this triangle then this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
height and the base of the original

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.550 
height and the base of the original
triangle<00:02:38.890> will<00:02:39.700> be<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:40.570> geometric

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

progression<00:02:42.690> because<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:44.500> base<00:02:44.860> upon

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
progression because this base upon

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.080 
progression because this base upon
height<00:02:45.960> will<00:02:46.960> bear<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.380> same<00:02:47.710> ratio<00:02:48.160> as<00:02:48.340> this

height<00:02:49.510> upon<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.560> base<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.450> therefore<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
height upon this base and therefore the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.590

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
product of these two bases will give us

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.130 
product of these two bases will give us
the<00:02:56.170> square<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.740> this<00:02:56.980> height<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:58.870> how<00:02:59.080> does

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.440 
that help us in finding a square root
well<00:03:01.330> imagine<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.410> situation<00:03:02.590> where<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:04.240> of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
these bases say this one is equal to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.890 
these bases say this one is equal to
unity<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.620> case<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.460> height<00:03:09.900> will

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
unity and in that case the height will

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.670 
unity and in that case the height will
be<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.230> square<00:03:11.530> root<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.730> base<00:03:13.680> let's

for<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.960> way<00:04:44.080> we<00:04:44.230> can<00:04:44.380> obtain

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
for so this is the way we can obtain

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.650 
for so this is the way we can obtain
square<00:04:44.980> roots<00:04:45.190> now<00:04:45.880> these<00:04:46.090> three<00:04:46.390> triangles

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
square roots now these three triangles

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.080 
square roots now these three triangles
that<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.140> constructed<00:04:47.650> have<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.490> strange

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
that we constructed have a strange

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.930 
that we constructed have a strange
connection<00:04:49.480> with<00:04:50.290> an<00:04:50.560> interesting<00:04:51.190> ancient

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.810 
connection with an interesting ancient
tool<00:04:52.180> called<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.080> our<00:04:53.410> bellows<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.100> árboles

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
tool called the our bellows and árboles

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.110 
tool called the our bellows and árboles
is<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.390> cobbler's<00:04:56.260> knife<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.130> if<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.760> look<00:04:57.940> at

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
is a cobbler's knife and if you look at

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.230 
is a cobbler's knife and if you look at
its<00:04:58.410> blade<00:04:59.410> you<00:05:00.370> would<00:05:00.460> realize<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:01.060> made

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
its blade you would realize it is made

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.900 
its blade you would realize it is made
up<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.540> three<00:05:02.050> semi<00:05:02.380> circles<00:05:02.830> really<00:05:02.980> so<00:05:03.580> there

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
up of three semi circles really so there

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.140 
up of three semi circles really so there
is<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.180> large<00:05:04.510> one<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.100> from<00:05:06.100> which<00:05:06.340> these

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
is this large one and from which these

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.570 
is this large one and from which these
two<00:05:07.390> smaller<00:05:07.780> semi<00:05:08.500> circles<00:05:08.920> of<00:05:09.100> half<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
two smaller semi circles of half the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.200 
two smaller semi circles of half the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
size are subtracted when Archimedes saw

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.560 
size are subtracted when Archimedes saw
this<00:05:13.450> he<00:05:13.660> was<00:05:13.780> absolutely<00:05:14.200> fascinated<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.570> he

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
this he was absolutely fascinated and he

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.600 
this he was absolutely fascinated and he
quickly<00:05:16.870> did<00:05:17.260> two<00:05:17.890> things<00:05:18.220> that

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
quickly did two things that

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.630 
quickly did two things that
mathematicians<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.540> to<00:05:19.720> do<00:05:19.870> number<00:05:20.440> one<00:05:20.650> he

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
mathematicians like to do number one he

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.020 
mathematicians like to do number one he
generalized<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:22.720> shape<00:05:23.400> by<00:05:24.400> making<00:05:24.850> these

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
generalized this shape by making these

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.720 
generalized this shape by making these
two<00:05:25.300> smaller<00:05:25.660> semi<00:05:26.080> circles<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.680> unequal<00:05:27.520> size

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
two smaller semi circles of unequal size

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.980 
two smaller semi circles of unequal size
and<00:05:28.000> number<00:05:28.990> two<00:05:29.200> he<00:05:29.740> started<00:05:30.340> thinking<00:05:30.790> about

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
and number two he started thinking about

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.120 
and number two he started thinking about
properties<00:05:31.990> of<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.500> shape<00:05:32.800> like<00:05:33.640> its<00:05:34.180> area<00:05:35.130> so

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
properties of the shape like its area so

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.060 
properties of the shape like its area so
the<00:05:36.790> area<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.240> shown<00:05:37.480> in<00:05:37.750> blue<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.200> this<00:05:38.890> is

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
the area is shown in blue and this is

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.910 
the area is shown in blue and this is
how<00:05:39.220> our<00:05:39.880> bellows<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.840> related<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.350> the

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
how our bellows is related to the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.060 
how our bellows is related to the
triangles<00:05:42.430> that<00:05:42.610> we<00:05:42.760> had<00:05:42.850> constructed<00:05:43.480> and

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
triangles that we had constructed and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.590 
triangles that we had constructed and
Archimedes<00:05:45.070> came<00:05:45.310> up<00:05:45.460> with<00:05:45.700> a<00:05:45.910> very

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
Archimedes came up with a very

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.650 
Archimedes came up with a very
impressive<00:05:47.170> statement<00:05:48.100> he<00:05:48.430> said<00:05:48.640> that<00:05:48.670> if<00:05:49.420> you

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
impressive statement he said that if you

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
impressive statement he said that if you
draw<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.320> circle<00:05:50.730> whose<00:05:51.730> diameter<00:05:52.090> is<00:05:52.660> given<00:05:53.320> by

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
draw a circle whose diameter is given by

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.820 
draw a circle whose diameter is given by
this<00:05:54.130> height<00:05:54.720> then<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.870> area<00:05:56.230> of<00:05:56.380> this<00:05:56.590> circle

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
this height then the area of this circle

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.750 
this height then the area of this circle
is<00:05:57.310> equal<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.940> area<00:05:58.150> of<00:05:58.390> this<00:05:58.720> our<00:05:59.169> bellows<00:05:59.760> let

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
is equal to area of this our bellows let

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.790 
is equal to area of this our bellows let
us<00:06:00.880> see<00:06:01.030> how<00:06:01.150> we<00:06:01.210> prove<00:06:01.510> that<00:06:01.540> we<00:06:02.020> are<00:06:02.470> already

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
us see how we prove that we are already

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.630 
us see how we prove that we are already
seen<00:06:03.160> that<00:06:03.460> area<00:06:03.880> of<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.419> geometric<00:06:04.630> figure<00:06:05.200> is

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
seen that area of a geometric figure is

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.010 
seen that area of a geometric figure is
proportional<00:06:06.640> to<00:06:06.669> any<00:06:07.120> of<00:06:07.330> its<00:06:07.540> linear

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
proportional to any of its linear

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.280 
proportional to any of its linear
dimensions<00:06:08.669> so<00:06:09.669> we<00:06:10.030> can<00:06:10.240> express<00:06:10.570> the<00:06:10.750> area<00:06:11.080> of

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
dimensions so we can express the area of

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.640 
dimensions so we can express the area of
this<00:06:11.620> larger<00:06:12.190> semicircle<00:06:13.150> in<00:06:13.630> terms<00:06:14.020> of<00:06:14.320> its

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
this larger semicircle in terms of its

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.720 
this larger semicircle in terms of its
diameter<00:06:15.160> a<00:06:15.490> plus<00:06:15.940> C<00:06:16.480> squared<00:06:17.190> of<00:06:18.190> course

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
diameter a plus C squared of course

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.909 
diameter a plus C squared of course
multiplied<00:06:19.210> by<00:06:19.390> some<00:06:19.870> constant<00:06:20.110> factor<00:06:20.410> which

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
multiplied by some constant factor which

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.560 
multiplied by some constant factor which
will<00:06:21.040> filter<00:06:21.280> out<00:06:21.430> because<00:06:21.970> it's<00:06:22.180> going<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.450> be

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
will filter out because it's going to be

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.409 
will filter out because it's going to be
there<00:06:22.750> for<00:06:22.960> all<00:06:23.110> our<00:06:23.320> expressions<00:06:24.030> but<00:06:25.030> so

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
there for all our expressions but so

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.750 
there for all our expressions but so
this<00:06:25.600> is<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.840> area<00:06:25.960> of<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.440> larger<00:06:26.860> semicircle

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
this is the area of a larger semicircle

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.470 
this is the area of a larger semicircle
from<00:06:28.600> it<00:06:28.780> let<00:06:29.200> us<00:06:29.230> subtract<00:06:29.710> this<00:06:30.120> semi<00:06:31.120> circle

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
from it let us subtract this semi circle

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.890 
from it let us subtract this semi circle
of<00:06:31.600> diameter<00:06:31.810> a<00:06:32.260> so<00:06:33.220> I'll<00:06:33.580> subtract<00:06:34.300> a<00:06:34.540> square

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
of diameter a so I'll subtract a square

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.950 
of diameter a so I'll subtract a square
then<00:06:35.890> this<00:06:36.340> second<00:06:36.790> semicircle<00:06:37.450> I'm<00:06:37.570> going<00:06:37.900> to

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
then this second semicircle I'm going to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.630 
then this second semicircle I'm going to
subtract<00:06:38.350> minus<00:06:38.950> C<00:06:39.130> square

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
subtract minus C square

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.150 
subtract minus C square
now<00:06:40.480> algebraically<00:06:41.080> speaking<00:06:41.320> this<00:06:41.919> is<00:06:41.980> the

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
now algebraically speaking this is the

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.590 
now algebraically speaking this is the
expansion<00:06:42.910> of<00:06:43.350> a<00:06:44.350> binomial<00:06:44.890> a<00:06:45.460> plus<00:06:45.490> C<00:06:45.910> squared

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
expansion of a binomial a plus C squared

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.469 
expansion of a binomial a plus C squared
so<00:06:47.500> if<00:06:47.620> you<00:06:47.710> subtract<00:06:48.220> a<00:06:48.430> square<00:06:48.880> and<00:06:49.060> C<00:06:49.210> Square

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
so if you subtract a square and C Square

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.150 
so if you subtract a square and C Square
from<00:06:49.630> that<00:06:49.930> you<00:06:50.470> will<00:06:50.560> be<00:06:50.650> left<00:06:50.860> with<00:06:51.070> only<00:06:51.100> two

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
from that you will be left with only two

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.130 
from that you will be left with only two
times<00:06:52.280> AC<00:06:53.710> this<00:06:54.710> a<00:06:54.950> into<00:06:55.550> C<00:06:55.790> is<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.540> product<00:06:56.960> of

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
times AC this a into C is the product of

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.710 
times AC this a into C is the product of
these<00:06:57.500> two<00:06:57.610> bases<00:06:58.610> which<00:06:59.270> we<00:06:59.450> are<00:06:59.540> already

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
these two bases which we are already

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.130 
these two bases which we are already
