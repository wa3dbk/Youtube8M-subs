00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.520

 today june package was not tracked 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.089
 the supplier checked at it 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.269
 I ordered earlier other watches 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.399
 the company that sells their watch 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.979
 so much so if you will 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 order do not worry without tracks 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.210
 fly too fast 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.000
 here is the window wrapped in a pimple 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.469
 so that they do not beat and in the first hours 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 if you remember there was no marking 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.259
 look these are all labeled 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.030
 I could have been born Chinese Ruza 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.250
 but I ordered black 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.250
 and I flew gray 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:47.159
 embarrassment will have to open a dispute 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.590
 participants working hours and minutes also 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.390
 there are days of the week 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 so they switch clamped tight 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:05.610
 minutes turned on this one for unpleasant 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 but that's okay open dispute who 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.160
 I can't teach a dispute 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.280
 everything is solved quickly so interesting 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.930

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.920

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.350
 hands cut off the unnecessary part of the plastic and 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:38.060
 In the same way, insert the clip on 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:41.819
 place and here it is on a magnet 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.480
