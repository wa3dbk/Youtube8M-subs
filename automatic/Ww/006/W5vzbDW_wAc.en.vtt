00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.200 
the stainless steel there doesn't add
any<00:04:21.190> weight<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.370> fact<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.760> probably<00:04:22.060> takes

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
any weight in fact it probably takes

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.860 
any weight in fact it probably takes
tiny<00:04:22.870> bit<00:04:23.020> away<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:24.669> it's<00:04:24.940> worth<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.599> I<00:04:25.660> think

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
tiny bit away so it's worth it I think

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.510 
tiny bit away so it's worth it I think
as<00:04:25.990> far<00:04:26.020> as<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.770> like<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:27.220> innovation
