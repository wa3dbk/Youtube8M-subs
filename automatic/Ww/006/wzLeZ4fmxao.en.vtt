these shoot over a hundred feet they're
the<00:02:17.280> next<00:02:17.550> generation<00:02:18.120> blasters<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.780> they're

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
the next generation blasters as they're

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.080 
the next generation blasters as they're
calling<00:02:19.410> them<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:20.040> those<00:02:20.220> gel<00:02:20.580> balls<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.060> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
calling them use those gel balls so you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.370 
calling them use those gel balls so you
don't<00:02:21.300> need<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> pick<00:02:21.690> them<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.260> of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
don't need to pick them up it kind of

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
don't need to pick them up it kind of
disintegrate<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.400> hit<00:02:23.550> their<00:02:23.700> target<00:02:24.210> so

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
disintegrate as they hit their target so

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.610

you<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.580> grow<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.150> gets<00:03:27.270> larger<00:03:27.720> now

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
you kind of grow and it gets larger now

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.990 
you kind of grow and it gets larger now
