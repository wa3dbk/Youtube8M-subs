 hey in this tutorial shows you like you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.289
 on mcgees automatically extract from zip 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 For example, you can get files away 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 By doing this for a moment, you have one 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 zip file wants to download 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.150
 you download and then that starts 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 to invite all of you see that a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 zip file is now but when it's done 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 is it anyway to folder and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.840
 Thematic office of desktops remains 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.670
 a file 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 but you would like to have it a zip file 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 what do you do? you just go 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 here on safari that is open 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 safari is up here on this point 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 safari in the bar and then up here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.450
 settings 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.770
 there you read it then it opens 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 Settings window you are under 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.879
 general and here below general 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.039
 Do you then make sure at this point 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.340
 files after loading open the hook 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.870
 tell off should it not be so, and the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.449
 One is already finding out more 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.010
 You can do it yourself and I'll show it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.200
 normal with click is normal of download 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 then let the whole thing down again 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
 same file when the now finished 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.290
 that should also remain a zip file 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 so jammers stayed with it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.930
 Of course I can now on the desktop 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
 theme and unpack manually so then will 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.020
 that is also a folder 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 so far no problem I hope 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.750
 i was able to help a lot and have fun with it 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.750
