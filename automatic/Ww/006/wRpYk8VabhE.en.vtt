00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that that experiment was pretty much a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.080

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.179 
there's my finger against her back legs
for<00:02:30.469> a<00:02:30.500> comparison<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.799> she's<00:02:34.040> pretty

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
for a comparison I think she's pretty

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.280 
for a comparison I think she's pretty
much<00:02:34.430> saying<00:02:34.670> she's<00:02:34.879> done<00:02:35.060> with<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.299> video<00:02:35.540> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
much saying she's done with the video so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.750 
much saying she's done with the video so
I<00:02:36.319> hope<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.620> guys<00:02:36.769> enjoyed<00:02:37.189> the<00:02:37.340> update<00:02:37.609> it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
I hope you guys enjoyed the update it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.589 
I hope you guys enjoyed the update it's
relatively<00:02:38.180> quick<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.689> can<00:02:38.810> tell<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:40.599> show

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
relatively quick as you can tell I show

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.830 
relatively quick as you can tell I show
you<00:02:41.629> some<00:02:41.840> anoles<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:43.569> they're<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.599> little

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
you some anoles but they're a little

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.490 
you some anoles but they're a little
difficult<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.379> find<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.980> here<00:02:47.260> that's<00:02:48.260> why<00:02:48.379> I'm

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
difficult to find in here that's why I'm

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.250 
difficult to find in here that's why I'm
not<00:02:48.680> exactly<00:02:49.069> sure<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.760> an<00:02:50.239> exact<00:02:50.659> count<00:02:51.079> of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
not exactly sure of an exact count of

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.670 
not exactly sure of an exact count of
how<00:02:51.409> many<00:02:51.469> have<00:02:51.859> survived<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.379> believe<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:54.560> to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
how many have survived I believe it to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
how many have survived I believe it to
be<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.010> neighborhood<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.459> five<00:02:56.950> but

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.270 

and<00:03:03.780> see<00:03:04.050> she's<00:03:04.260> definitely<00:03:04.740> putting<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.070> some

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
and see she's definitely putting on some

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.260 
and see she's definitely putting on some
weight

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.970 

just<00:03:08.810> give<00:03:08.960> me<00:03:08.990> something<00:03:09.440> more<00:03:09.590> continuous

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
just give me something more continuous

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.900 
just give me something more continuous
shot<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.460> all<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.610> additional<00:03:11.150> plants

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.370 

it's<00:03:18.360> definitely<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.720> lot<00:03:18.840> warmer<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.320> here

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's definitely a lot warmer in here

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.070 
it's definitely a lot warmer in here
than<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.280> has<00:03:20.520> been<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> past<00:03:21.710> few<00:03:22.710> months
