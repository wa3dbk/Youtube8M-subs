00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.170
 plus 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.760
 good happy for the result with the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.270
 classification for being second that we 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.490
 continues to maintain the world's elite 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.700
 European and global good especially the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.620
 game 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.870
 the one developed during the first day 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.880
 of the tournament with the pressure of the 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.710
 classification of the world cup and the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 solution to the conference the first one so 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 that the truth is that the rivals were not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.440
 very difficult but yes that also the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.300
 team went all out at all 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.350
 parties I think we've done one of the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 best tournaments 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.759
 France the truth is that always 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.920
 we usually win is a game that usually 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.140
 be very hard because I already know in the bucks 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.600
 they do a good job at the end every 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.240
 player technically individually is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 good and good yes they started food 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 a little asleep and she chained 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 a couple of good phases and they started 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.880
 rehearsing so true that follow the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.440
 team is recomposed we see our 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 systems to be faithful to the system and 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.539
 our game and they have already started 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.049
 the trials and we already came up and 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.049
 we finished pretty well 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.760
 they were jude and I was 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.170
 what good 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.070
 england got the batteries and I think that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 he played as a team and we had no choice 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.360
 at least the time I was in the field 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.899
 we won the serves from the center 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.049
 then attacking with verticality of sivas 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.429
 and nothing just congratulate them because they played 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.140
 well ever they respect us more 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.489
 working in the game thinking 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.130
 us he started I had a 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.569
 complicated trial at the beginning two 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 complicated at the beginning the injury of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.530
 barbie we do not start making decisions 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.239
 maybe a little weird jobs 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
 england playing very well level with what 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.780
 which one 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.769
 if we are not we all all 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.750
 the sums of our game 100% is 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.439
 complicated but we are close 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.879
 you have to take a chance to lage 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.370
 not the truth is that my sister is in 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.939
 a level of incredible form is a pleasure 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.189
 fly to play and play with her because she is 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.590
 a wonder and luck that is in 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:50.590
 our team but good that we are 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.989
 there and that we did not get off the train and yes 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.299
 that england is now proven that 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.829
 it's on another step but we 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.269
 we are also there I think the others 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.480
 selections 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.370
 they are also one step behind 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.340
 that I think we're on the line 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.599
 good work and already continue like this we have 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.459
 come to the end of less we have 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.480
 explained to change the whole world 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.030
 that was also objective is super 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.099
 important it is difficult to stay up 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.230
 many of good oil earn a European 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.760
 maybe it's easy in quotation marks or you can 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.040
 get to do it they call you have you 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 four years in a row in the final if 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.200
 first deserved vacation I think 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.430
 that we deserve a couple of weeks of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 disconnect total beach rugby 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.500
 rest see the family 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.120
 in august is a very nice year let's hope 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.010
 to invite us back to the world series that 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.989
 have to be by results I think that we 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.019
 where we are and of course to prepare 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.400
 the world that is going to be something 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.079
 incredible we have already been in others 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.540
 some world and they always come 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.340
 worldwide for an athlete something something 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 spectacular with the work of the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 operation that we hope will help us and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.189
 good because we can dedicate ourselves only to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.530
 make rugby professionals already 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.709
 get to do something big in the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.709
 world 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.750
