just<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:10.850> show<00:00:10.969> you<00:00:11.210> why<00:00:11.960> you<00:00:11.990> need<00:00:12.379> a<00:00:12.410> Jujubee

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
just to show you why you need a Jujubee

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.759 
just to show you why you need a Jujubee
fuel<00:00:13.309> cell<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:13.940> what<00:00:14.930> I<00:00:14.959> would<00:00:15.260> put<00:00:15.440> in<00:00:15.559> mine

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
fuel cell and what I would put in mine

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.920 
fuel cell and what I would put in mine
if<00:00:16.189> we<00:00:16.670> were<00:00:16.730> going<00:00:16.880> out<00:00:17.060> for<00:00:17.119> more<00:00:17.540> than<00:00:17.689> a<00:00:17.720> few

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
if we were going out for more than a few

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.540 
if we were going out for more than a few
hours<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:19.040> this<00:00:19.550> bag<00:00:20.050> it<00:00:21.050> fits<00:00:21.470> in<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.680> BFF<00:00:22.189> but

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
hours so this bag it fits in the BFF but

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.569 
hours so this bag it fits in the BFF but
you<00:00:23.090> can't<00:00:23.329> really<00:00:23.540> fit<00:00:23.810> too<00:00:24.680> much<00:00:24.860> else<00:00:25.070> when

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
you can't really fit too much else when

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.450 
you can't really fit too much else when
you<00:00:25.700> put<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.060> in<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.270> BFF<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:27.710> wouldn't<00:00:28.220> use

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
you put this in a BFF so I wouldn't use

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.150 
you put this in a BFF so I wouldn't use
this<00:00:28.730> if<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.119> was<00:00:29.270> bringing<00:00:29.630> my<00:00:29.779> ggb<00:00:30.320> BFF<00:00:30.800> out

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
this if I was bringing my ggb BFF out

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.069 
this if I was bringing my ggb BFF out
for<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.610> day<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:32.029> would<00:00:32.480> probably<00:00:32.630> put<00:00:32.899> this

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
for the day I would probably put this

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.340 
for the day I would probably put this
bag<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:33.680> might<00:00:33.980> be<00:00:34.010> prepared<00:00:34.640> or<00:00:34.880> my<00:00:35.840> super

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
bag and might be prepared or my super

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.840 
bag and might be prepared or my super
beat<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.710> I'm<00:00:37.010> actually<00:00:37.160> going<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.460> be<00:00:37.579> doing

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
beat and I'm actually going to be doing

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.700 
beat and I'm actually going to be doing
a<00:00:37.940> comparison<00:00:38.239> video<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.840> those<00:00:39.260> two<00:00:39.500> bags

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
a comparison video of those two bags

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.700 
a comparison video of those two bags
later<00:00:40.070> on<00:00:40.310> so<00:00:41.120> if<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:42.170> any<00:00:42.320> questions

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
later on so if you have any questions

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.060 
later on so if you have any questions
about<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.550> know<00:00:43.610> how<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:44.510> bag<00:00:45.470> would<00:00:45.800> look

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
about you know how this bag would look

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.760 
about you know how this bag would look
inside<00:00:46.910> one<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.210> those<00:00:47.360> bags<00:00:47.630> then<00:00:48.320> be<00:00:48.590> sure<00:00:48.740> to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
inside one of those bags then be sure to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.910 
inside one of those bags then be sure to
check<00:00:48.890> out<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:49.280> video<00:00:49.450> so<00:00:50.450> my<00:00:51.200> daughter<00:00:51.410> is<00:00:51.590> 7

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
check out that video so my daughter is 7

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.100 
check out that video so my daughter is 7
months<00:00:52.130> old<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.760> she's<00:00:53.210> formula-fed<00:00:53.840> she

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
months old and she's formula-fed she

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.080 
months old and she's formula-fed she
drinks<00:00:54.380> 4<00:00:54.560> bottles<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.010> day<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:55.700> if<00:00:55.850> we<00:00:55.970> were

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
drinks 4 bottles a day so if we were

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.790 
drinks 4 bottles a day so if we were
going<00:00:56.240> out<00:00:56.450> for<00:00:56.780> more<00:00:56.900> than<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.110> few<00:00:57.290> hours<00:00:57.350> I'd

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
going out for more than a few hours I'd

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.830 
going out for more than a few hours I'd
probably<00:00:58.010> bring<00:00:58.280> two<00:00:58.850> bottles<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.720> she

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
probably bring two bottles and she

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.780 
probably bring two bottles and she
drinks<00:01:00.110> one<00:01:00.290> right<00:01:01.130> when<00:01:01.310> she<00:01:01.400> wakes<00:01:01.489> up<00:01:01.640> in

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
drinks one right when she wakes up in

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.940 
drinks one right when she wakes up in
the<00:01:01.820> morning<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.360> drink<00:01:02.930> before<00:01:03.170> bed<00:01:03.350> so

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
the morning and drink before bed so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.969 
the morning and drink before bed so
unless<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:04.460> are<00:01:04.579> gonna<00:01:04.670> be<00:01:04.909> out<00:01:05.590> literally<00:01:06.590> all

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
unless we are gonna be out literally all

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.249 
unless we are gonna be out literally all
day<00:01:07.399> or<00:01:07.820> if<00:01:08.659> we're<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:08.869> somewhere

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
day or if we're going somewhere

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.410 
day or if we're going somewhere
overnight<00:01:09.799> two<00:01:10.399> bottles<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:11.000> probably<00:01:11.300> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
overnight two bottles is probably the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.800 
overnight two bottles is probably the
most<00:01:11.510> I'll<00:01:11.780> ever<00:01:11.900> need<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.070> those<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.600> look

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
most I'll ever need so those that look

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.410 
most I'll ever need so those that look
very<00:01:15.170> nicely<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.130> fuel<00:01:16.340> cell<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.850> doctor

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
very nicely in the fuel cell the doctor

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.770 
very nicely in the fuel cell the doctor

8<00:01:17.930> ounce<00:01:18.190> top<00:01:19.190> bottles<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:20.960> actually

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
8 ounce top bottles and you can actually

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.370 
8 ounce top bottles and you can actually
fit<00:01:21.770> at<00:01:22.159> least<00:01:22.690> four<00:01:23.690> in<00:01:23.930> there<00:01:25.150> they<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:27.320> looks

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
fit at least four in there they it looks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.230 
fit at least four in there they it looks
like<00:01:27.710> they<00:01:27.830> come<00:01:28.100> over<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.400> top<00:01:28.430> but<00:01:29.090> then

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
like they come over the top but then

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.530 
like they come over the top but then
when<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.479> go<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.630> close<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.640> top<00:01:31.940> area

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
when you go to close it up the top area

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.969 
when you go to close it up the top area
right<00:01:32.780> here<00:01:32.810> gives<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.409> little<00:01:33.590> bit<00:01:33.799> more

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
right here gives it a little bit more

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.310 
right here gives it a little bit more
more<00:01:34.729> ruminant<00:01:35.150> zips<00:01:35.360> up<00:01:35.510> very<00:01:35.690> nicely<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
more ruminant zips up very nicely and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.539 
more ruminant zips up very nicely and
then<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.340> my<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.970> know<00:01:38.180> baby<00:01:39.340> pack<00:01:40.340> and

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
then this is my you know baby pack and

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
then this is my you know baby pack and
smart<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.970> think<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:41.240> called<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:42.260> would

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
smart I think it's called and I would

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.500 
smart I think it's called and I would
put<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.830> first<00:01:43.130> fill<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.150> first<00:01:44.299> two

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
put the first fill the first two

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.960 
put the first fill the first two
containers<00:01:44.900> with<00:01:45.680> formula<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.430> then<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.610> would

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
containers with formula and then I would

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.170 
containers with formula and then I would
use<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.680> know<00:01:48.799> maybe<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:49.670> or<00:01:49.820> two<00:01:49.850> more

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
use the you know maybe one or two more

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.080 
use the you know maybe one or two more
just<00:01:50.420> four<00:01:50.659> puffs<00:01:50.900> or<00:01:51.640> yogurt<00:01:52.640> melts<00:01:52.939> or<00:01:53.060> a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
just four puffs or yogurt melts or a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.570 
just four puffs or yogurt melts or a
small<00:01:53.479> snack<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:54.680> her<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.130> that's

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
small snack like that for her and that's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.390 
small snack like that for her and that's
like<00:01:55.729> very<00:01:56.000> nicely<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.540> can<00:01:56.619> probably<00:01:57.619> fit<00:01:58.100> I

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
like very nicely you can probably fit I

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.649 
like very nicely you can probably fit I
haven't<00:01:58.820> tried<00:01:58.939> it<00:01:59.150> but<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.390> could<00:01:59.540> probably

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
