downstream<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.580> is<00:00:21.789> a<00:00:21.820> little<00:00:22.210> trick<00:00:22.449> on<00:00:22.660> how

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
downstream here is a little trick on how

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:40.420 
downstream here is a little trick on how
to<00:00:23.529> get<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:24.010> back

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.680 

firstly<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.240> small<00:00:43.220> grumble<00:00:44.220> or

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
firstly you get a small grumble or

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100 
firstly you get a small grumble or
sapling<00:00:45.690> branch<00:00:47.030> long<00:00:48.030> enough<00:00:48.330> to<00:00:48.690> fit<00:00:48.930> over

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
sapling branch long enough to fit over

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.070 
sapling branch long enough to fit over
the<00:00:49.530> rod<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> reel<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:53.390> then<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.570> fold<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
the rod and reel and then you fold the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.820 
the rod and reel and then you fold the
branch<00:00:55.440> around<00:00:56.040> itself<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.540> form<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:58.170> perfect

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
branch around itself to form the perfect

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:07.030 
branch around itself to form the perfect
circle

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.660 

and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.210> pass<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.780> down<00:01:09.650> over<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.460> rod

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
and then you pass it down over the rod

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.800 
and then you pass it down over the rod
and<00:01:10.880> reel<00:01:11.530> down<00:01:12.530> towards<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.190> fishing<00:01:13.610> line

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.050 

with<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> force<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.590> water<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.310> in

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
with the force of the water and in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.330 
with the force of the water and in
parting<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.780> up<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.230> down<00:01:21.320> side<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:21.950> side

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
parting and up and down side to side

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.420 
parting and up and down side to side
pulling<00:01:23.150> action<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:24.230> force<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.860> bramble

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
pulling action the force of the bramble

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:37.469 
pulling action the force of the bramble
will<00:01:25.970> pull<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.270> spinner<00:01:26.750> out<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.350> rock

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.150 

normally<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.840> will<00:01:38.990> get<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.470> bramble<00:01:39.950> back

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
normally you will get the bramble back

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.120 
normally you will get the bramble back
but<00:01:41.090> if<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.390> don't<00:01:41.690> there<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:42.619> plenty<00:01:42.920> of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
but if you don't there are plenty of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.240 
but if you don't there are plenty of
branches<00:01:43.670> around<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:44.570> make<00:01:44.810> another<00:01:45.250> ultimate

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
branches around to make another ultimate

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.219 
branches around to make another ultimate
spinner<00:01:46.880> retrieval<00:01:47.540> tool<00:01:49.630> when<00:01:50.630> using

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
spinner retrieval tool when using

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.460 
spinner retrieval tool when using
brambles<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.640> strip<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.240> bark<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:54.229> make<00:01:54.440> a

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
brambles you strip the bark to make a

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.630 
brambles you strip the bark to make a
nice<00:01:54.830> smooth<00:01:55.280> branch

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.580 

and<00:02:01.400> this<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> stripped<00:02:03.150> bramble<00:02:03.930> branch

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.949 

both<00:02:07.590> bramble<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.490> sapling<00:02:09.240> will<00:02:09.600> do<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> job

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
both bramble and sapling will do the job

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.770 
both bramble and sapling will do the job
once<00:02:10.740> they<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:10.979> supple<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:14.390> there<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> have

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
once they are supple and there you have

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.090 
once they are supple and there you have
it<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.260> ultimate<00:02:16.380> spinner<00:02:17.100> retrieval<00:02:17.880> tool
