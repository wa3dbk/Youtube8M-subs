00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 within this master class we 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 focus on the basics 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 poly hard service modeling 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.849
 I want to immediately note that this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 Master Class 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 not a detailed video tutorial on 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.480
 modeling environment 3ds max 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.940
 he is only visual and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
 in general, a short guide purpose 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.789
 which present in general 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 modeling process 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 landfill based 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 By the way landfill is my 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.440
 favorite technique when creating 3d models 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.330
 cars 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.100
 preparation for modeling or 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.200
 another object is one of the most 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.930
 important phases of all work 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.110
 here can be attributed and drawings drawings 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.530
 or sketches or sketch and this is a separate 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.970
 theme 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.640
 these materials are 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.350
 projections on which we create so 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 called virtual projection 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.820
 studio due to which it is possible itself 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.100
 3d modeling actually 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 polygonal hard surprise simulation 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.900
 car we will implement 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.180
 exactly by the projection of course modeling 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.920
 projection is not the only 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.230
 3D modeling technique 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.900
 There are many different techniques. 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.240
 techniques and ways to achieve one and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.920
 the same result however the body 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.710
 any car is almost impossible 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.550
 build without projections tinted drawing 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 by the way 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 is quite meaningful and meaningful 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.530
 obscuring the original drawing we simplify 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.020
 process such as trimming or ping kro 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 source image on a separate part 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.159
 to project on 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 orton reinforced plane which in 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.950
 in general, it can be called projection 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.440
 planes 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.270
 or play us a projection plane and this 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.250
 single equivalent items 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.470
 virtual studio conclusion 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.780
 the preparatory stage is also worth 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 note the importance of information on major 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.580
 dimensions of a future particular model for 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.460
 In our case, important data are 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.030
 length opel car width and height 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.520
 astra 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.950
 this value we betray the original 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 box projection studio saving those 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.840
 the most proportion between the three 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.230
 forum factors of model width and width 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.230
 tall
