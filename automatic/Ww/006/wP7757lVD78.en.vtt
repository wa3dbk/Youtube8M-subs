00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 but before I wanted to start with a 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.230
 history that has lasted for about 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.770
 ten days you are heard 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.750
 talk about it on charleroi photos that 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.250
 have received a rain from the new 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 york times him paul magnette had said 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.920
 no there is a little phase iib fication 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.379
 an investigation that was open and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 Wednesday the price were removed at 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.140
 photographers because one of the photos 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.930
 precisely had not been taken to 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.609
 charleroi but in molenbeek and and I am 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.410
 not good in Belgian geography but it's 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.740
 really not the same place there is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 not very different 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.929
 geographically speaking and we want 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.579
 can talk about the story the man is telling himself 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.870
 what could we talk about for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.510
 go back on it we found 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.219
 someone who was on the pictures who 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 is the subject of the photos I think we 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.940
 can see it by the way it's this man 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 his name is philippe gagnon and accepted 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.399

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.790
 already picture how it is spent 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.150
 meeting with the photographer with this 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.610
 trailer 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 how did it go from your nail 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.520
 but he contacted me one day he told me 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.009

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.470
 artistic charleroi so not on 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.060
 charleroi hockey is good here you are 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.210

 want a goal kim of a bug ndaw 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.740
 Walloon have known a month have known him 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.380
 it's a little bit because I do not have 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.550
 to tell if he is when I'm naked but 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.320
 and here I am at the level of the books 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.280
 for my wine bar which I could not 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.140
 not the name because we do not advertise 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.039
 but where all the handbags of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.259
 charleroi finds otherwise the photo 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.149
 picture he came one day an hour 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.590
 lighting ok so he said to me here I 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.060
 want you to put in your 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.679
 salon finally and that's the soul room to 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.729
 eat what he wants he wanted this 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.009
 as a painting 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.290
 no dry Flemish artist on the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.239
 elements there are a lot of big there are 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.750
 a lot of your selves I think rather 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.750
 muscular 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.740
 you have the dominate to the assets so I have 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.050
 a beautiful bodine and my abdomen and 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.069
 public domain 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.110
 and what did he think about the fact that 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.959
 the photos were removed so good 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 it is not this pan-African cry report 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.660
 journalistic he does not know anyway 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.800
 not presented to me as a journalist 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.630
 yes he said to me here I am a photographer 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.860
 of fashion I boot for verse walk 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.560
 back on Thursday by actually eating the meat 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 curve so that will be fine and it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.040
 wanted to make aesthetic pictures is 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.420
 asked after what surprised me 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.250
 it's the legends in all the photos 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.260
 who to present the city as a 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.550
 cut absolute throat but he told me 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.140
 it's hard I'm going to make a metaphor of 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.580
 on europe I think that there the decline 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.080
 of charleroi represents a little in 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.959
 concentrated the decline of europe 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 So the industry is collapsing and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.500
 rise of all that what cannibalism of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.319
 tea thing we see that the days in 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.340
 the street car ok so it's at the base 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.019
 it was seen in our artistic project 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.370
 and between seven and sold more or less 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.860
 like a position enough that's it for 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.810
 you spoil it has in any case go into 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.220
 a category is called stories or that 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.130
 can be photos taken at one place 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.590
 to show you a story so I 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.120
 think he makes it very honestly 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.170
 but by cons there is a photo really 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.880
 that he is not taken to charleroi so 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.870
 and it's crazy because in fact the photo 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.640
 it's me who is sick is that 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.290
 this is not a photo of the city which 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.269
 she is in love to the hell and back or 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 elsewhere in this sense nothing because they in 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.060
 are in charlemagne in the views one does not 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.280
 find no women in the cages do not 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 can not find a big seat of restraint 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.799
 in their corridors of recontres I 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.060
 am a corridor no one will pass 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.560
 no logic and so that's all 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.880
 these things that we release to photograph 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.859
 it was clearly staged there 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.480
 there is a picture of two people doing 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.079
 the soul authorizing a car on a 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.670
 vacant lot 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.720
 but you if you do that do you 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.920
 leave the headlights on, do you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.840
 install a blue light inside 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.859
 your car personally and above all 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.420
 if there are people making love in 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.239
 a car this month already once a wall 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.109
 to do that what worries me more 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.130
 it's not the people who make love 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.870
 it's the person who takes pictures 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.239
 behind I admit that it's a good one if they 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.109
 agree there is no problem I 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.400
 do not like to make me notice I 'm 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.180
 allow colors all that but I have 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.469
 noticed you 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.379
 we seem to be someone very 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.909
 discreet who are fleeing the camera I had 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.680
 difficult to convince 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
 fake yeah at least the pickups 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 names he believes the cameras this is 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.329
 I'm interested in cocaine and 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.049
 local white wine it was a long time ago 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.750
 to Montreal 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.350
 it takes crazy electric it's crazy 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.060
 the precision salad in quebec 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.120
 phone are the buttocks and fauns 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.680
 and the electric keys it's a club 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.639
 underground 6 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:45.919
 it's an underground club of houta of the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:49.479
 miss her alternative music and 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.699
 then you still had a question 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.160
 we your attention capacity of 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.960
 pastels and his seconds not for what 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.039
 I can do answers race I 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.520
 thought matters it depends what 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.710
 caracas 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.940
 but in case your question is' ​​which of the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.750
 venezuela that's not good but the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.520
 issue that's all you had 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.990
 contacts with Mr. No bike 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.190
 no I sent an e-mail to tell him 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.780
 what was happening in charleroi on avis 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.400
 must be busy busy answering any 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.199
 a series of police questions or 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.760
 I do not know what but for him it's you 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.050
 it starts a good thing for him 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.520
 because we talked about 8.2 strong him 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.510
 two names we talked a lot about him and 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.880
 for charleroi I think in the end 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.500
 it's totally positive because that's it 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.729
 there were these pictures that depicted 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.260
 charleroi as a negative thing we in 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.639
 belgium we know that most people 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.820
 know very well how and charleroi 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.020
 also people in tokyo and who decides to 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.490
 do not come because of charleroi 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.570
 photos but we will have more beer to 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.180
 drink it will not change much 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.560
 only guards the abalone and I 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.360
 think that ultimately the final attention 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.099
 media both press and tv 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.330
 they finally came to check that 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.199
 it was not that and they showed 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.199
 positive of charleroi
