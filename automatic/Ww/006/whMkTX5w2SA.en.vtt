and I thought you know what I need to
look<00:00:12.389> back<00:00:12.660> at<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:12.990> figure<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.380> what's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
look back at this and figure out what's

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230

going<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> did<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> here's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> little

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
going on so I did and here's a little

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.189 
going on so I did and here's a little
bit<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> proof<00:00:17.449> and<00:00:18.449> obviously<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.170> I

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
bit of proof and obviously you know I

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.660 
bit of proof and obviously you know I
couldn't<00:00:19.500> let<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.920> unpunished<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.640> I

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
couldn't let that go unpunished so I

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.849 
couldn't let that go unpunished so I
quickly<00:00:21.210> handled<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> situation<00:00:21.930> present

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
getting to the part where it just gets

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.740 
getting to the part where it just gets
kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> sad<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.420> met<00:02:12.630> is

can<00:02:14.190> boost<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.550> more<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.000> assume<00:02:15.239> they

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
can boost some more as I assume they

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
can boost some more as I assume they
don't<00:02:15.540> even<00:02:15.600> know<00:02:15.780> how<00:02:15.930> at<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.290> concert<00:02:16.650> works

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and then while he's waiting jolt ER and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
and then while he's waiting jolt ER and
I<00:02:18.900> just<00:02:19.080> trapped<00:02:19.350> him<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.590> corner<00:02:19.770> confused
