00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
bigness can play the song so I'm going

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
bigness can play the song so I'm going
to<00:00:45.030> put<00:00:45.239> capo<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:46.020> fret<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> I'm

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to put capo on the first fret and I'm

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
to put capo on the first fret and I'm
going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> change<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> shot<00:00:47.700> into<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.590> know

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
going to change a shot into a you know

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
going to change a shot into a you know
because<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.120> fret<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because I put it on the first fret it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
because I put it on the first fret it
has<00:00:51.690> combined<00:00:52.079> semi<00:00:52.350> note<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> that's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
has combined semi note down and that's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
has combined semi note down and that's
why<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.000> shop<00:00:54.510> will<00:00:55.410> become<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.570> C<00:00:57.570> minor<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
why a shop will become a C minor is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
why a shop will become a C minor is
going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> remain<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> same<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.609> you're

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
going to remain the same because you're

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
going to remain the same because you're
going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> play<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> power<00:01:00.660> version<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to play the power version and the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.780 
going to play the power version and the
D<00:01:02.250> sharp<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.239> become<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> D<00:01:03.780> minor<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
D sharp will become the D minor so the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.410 
D sharp will become the D minor so the
simple<00:01:06.119> cost<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.430> C<00:01:08.430> minor<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.420> D<00:01:09.990> minor

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
simple cost now or a C minor and D minor

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:24.110 
simple cost now or a C minor and D minor
so<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.840> strumming<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.700 

all<00:01:25.120> right<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.990> then<00:01:26.140> they<00:01:26.260> kill<00:01:26.410> de<00:01:26.530> souza

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
all right and then they kill de souza

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.860 
all right and then they kill de souza
version<00:01:27.160> they<00:01:27.760> have<00:01:27.790> played<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.240> intro<00:01:28.600> when

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
arpeggios on the same chord it's going

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.720 
arpeggios on the same chord it's going
to<00:01:30.700> sound<00:01:30.820> like

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.630 

all<00:01:37.360> right<00:01:37.690> nothing

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
