the graphics by far our are the best i

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.160 
the graphics by far our are the best i
think<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.619> playstation<00:02:10.220> 3<00:02:10.490> i<00:02:10.780> think<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.990> i'm

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
think on playstation 3 i think that i'm

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.100 
think on playstation 3 i think that i'm
at<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.500> early<00:02:12.650> stage<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.630> games<00:02:14.870> are<00:02:15.020> still

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
at this early stage the games are still

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.449 
at this early stage the games are still
going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.350> look<00:02:15.470> pretty<00:02:15.500> similar<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.100> other

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
going to look pretty similar to other

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.940 
going to look pretty similar to other
systems<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.940> are<00:02:17.090> out<00:02:17.209> there<00:02:17.239> but

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
systems that are out there but

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.770 
systems that are out there but
playstation<00:02:18.950> 3<00:02:19.130> has<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.489> much<00:02:19.610> potential<00:02:20.000> with

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
playstation 3 has so much potential with

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.620 
playstation 3 has so much potential with
the<00:02:20.930> new<00:02:21.050> cell<00:02:21.319> chipped<00:02:22.220> inhabitant<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.000> think

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the new cell chipped inhabitant I think

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.790 
the new cell chipped inhabitant I think
eventually<00:02:23.989> it'll<00:02:24.440> blow<00:02:24.620> away<00:02:24.709> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
eventually it'll blow away the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.570 
eventually it'll blow away the
competition<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.959> as<00:02:26.959> you'll<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.400> right

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
competition and as you'll just see right

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.570 
competition and as you'll just see right
now<00:02:28.610> from<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> graphics<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:31.190> already<00:02:31.400> look

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
now from the graphics they already look

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.770 
now from the graphics they already look
awesome<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.860> can't<00:02:33.890> wait<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.310> see<00:02:34.780> what

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
awesome I really can't wait to see what

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:59.370 
awesome I really can't wait to see what
Sony<00:02:36.019> does<00:02:36.760> month

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.240 

I<00:03:00.640> guess<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> only<00:03:02.770> complaint<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:04.040> about

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I guess the only complaint I have about

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.230 
I guess the only complaint I have about
the<00:03:04.430> playstation<00:03:04.970> 3<00:03:05.240> is<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:07.240> quality

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
the playstation 3 is it on the quality

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.620 
the playstation 3 is it on the quality
of<00:03:08.330> DVD<00:03:08.840> playback<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.670> actually<00:03:10.670> not<00:03:10.819> as<00:03:11.090> good

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
of DVD playback is actually not as good
