well<00:00:00.450> when<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> long<00:00:01.350> time<00:00:01.560> 165<00:00:02.460> plays<00:00:02.700> that's<00:00:02.939> a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
well when a long time 165 plays that's a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.749 
well when a long time 165 plays that's a
lot<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> football<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:04.400> it<00:00:05.400> was<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.580> hottest

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
lot of football and it was the hottest

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.830 
lot of football and it was the hottest
day<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> camp<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:07.130> we<00:00:08.130> were<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:09.210> most<00:00:09.420> fatigued

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
day of camp so we were the most fatigued

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480 
day of camp so we were the most fatigued
we'd<00:00:10.019> probably<00:00:10.260> been<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.070> then<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
we'd probably been and then it was the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.039 
we'd probably been and then it was the
hottest<00:00:11.730> day<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.090> camp<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.929> really

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
hottest day of camp so I was really

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.950 
hottest day of camp so I was really
proud<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.380> him<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.650> 165<00:00:14.580> plays<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.839> as

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
proud of him for 165 plays and going as

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.330 
proud of him for 165 plays and going as
hard<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.289> did<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.529> long<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:16.980> did<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
hard as they did as long as they did I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.980 
hard as they did as long as they did I
thought<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> office<00:00:18.570> looked<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> little

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
thought the office looked a little

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.230 
thought the office looked a little
fresher<00:00:21.260> in<00:00:22.260> camp<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.519> legs<00:00:23.760> come<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.180> they

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
fresher in camp the legs come and they

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.109 
fresher in camp the legs come and they
go<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> couple<00:00:24.840> times<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:26.070> usually<00:00:26.340> even

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
go a couple times and they usually even

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
go a couple times and they usually even
though<00:00:27.210> both<00:00:27.359> teams<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> practice

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
though both teams are on the practice

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.529 
though both teams are on the practice
field<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> same<00:00:29.010> length<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:30.090> side<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
field the same length one side of the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.939 
field the same length one side of the
ball<00:00:30.689> goes<00:00:30.960> at<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.650> than<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ball goes at a different time than the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
ball goes at a different time than the
other<00:00:32.099> side<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.640> thought<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.660> particular

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
other side I thought this particular

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
other side I thought this particular
round<00:00:34.320> favored<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> offense<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
round favored the offense is for the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.190 
round favored the offense is for the
legs<00:00:36.300> rather<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.790> it's<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> say<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
legs rather but it's not to say that the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.479 
legs rather but it's not to say that the
defense<00:00:40.530> didn't<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.800> success<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
defense didn't have success in the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
defense didn't have success in the
scrimmage<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.210> did<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.870> overall

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
scrimmage but they did but but overall

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.729 
scrimmage but they did but but overall
the<00:00:43.410> often<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:45.469> kering<00:00:46.469> theme

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the often just a little bit kering theme

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
the often just a little bit kering theme
so<00:00:47.190> far<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:48.090> looking<00:00:48.570> better<00:00:49.730> no<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:51.090> no<00:00:51.300> not

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so far it's looking better no no no not

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
so far it's looking better no no no not
at<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.320> i<00:00:52.379> think<00:00:52.739> both<00:00:53.100> sides

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
at all not at all i think both sides

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
at all not at all i think both sides
have<00:00:53.579> traded<00:00:54.300> punches<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.110> had<00:00:55.469> their

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have traded punches and then had their

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
have traded punches and then had their
days<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> had<00:00:56.129> their<00:00:56.280> times<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
days and had their times the thing that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
days and had their times the thing that
you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.430> get<00:01:01.190> used<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.850> camp<00:01:03.480> if

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you can really get used with in camp if

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.530 
you can really get used with in camp if
you<00:01:04.080> allow<00:01:04.290> yourself<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you allow yourself to is is that that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800 
you allow yourself to is is that that
one<00:01:06.720> time<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.140> performed<00:01:08.390> there's<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.510> much<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
one time is performed there's so much it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.340 
one time is performed there's so much it
goes<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> scripted<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.600> not<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:13.049> plan

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.899 
goes on and scripted and not game plan
and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.890> trying<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> feed<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> other

you've got in on film you want to see it
you<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.170> plays<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.680> you're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
calling it a number of times in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
calling it a number of times in
situations<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.960> wouldn't<00:01:25.409> call<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
situations that you wouldn't call it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
situations that you wouldn't call it
game<00:01:26.040> day<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
game day and the same thing on the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.050 
game day and the same thing on the
practice<00:01:27.780> field<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.979> defense<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.820> end<00:01:29.939> up

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
practice field so a defense could end up

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.020 
practice field so a defense could end up
with<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> 10-yard<00:01:30.930> sack<00:01:31.610> because<00:01:32.610> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
with it with a 10-yard sack because what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
with it with a 10-yard sack because what
the<00:01:33.119> offense<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> orphans<00:01:34.200> could

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the offense was in or the orphans could

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
the offense was in or the orphans could
end<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:34.710> 80-yard<00:01:34.979> touchdown<00:01:35.189> because

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
end up with an 80-yard touchdown because

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.319 
end up with an 80-yard touchdown because
what<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> defense<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.790> who's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
what the defense was it a you know who's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
what the defense was it a you know who's
who's<00:01:39.900> having<00:01:40.290> better<00:01:40.470> days<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> other

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
who's having better days in the other

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.590 
who's having better days in the other
when<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.579> getting<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> accomplished<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
when you're getting that accomplished I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
when you're getting that accomplished I
think<00:01:43.140> our<00:01:43.229> quarterbacks<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.950> having<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> nice

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
think our quarterbacks are having a nice

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.690 
think our quarterbacks are having a nice
camp<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.560> that's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> good<00:01:46.829> place<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.159> start<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
camp but that's a good place to start I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.929 
camp but that's a good place to start I
think<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> old<00:01:48.780> line<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> improved<00:01:49.939> from

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
think the old line is improved from

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
think the old line is improved from
where<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.329> were<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.290> spring<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.740> where

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
where they were in the spring from where

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
where they were in the spring from where
they<00:01:53.040> were<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> year<00:01:53.399> ago

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.260 

the<00:01:57.899> receiver<00:01:58.469> group<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.130> shows<00:02:00.030> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the receiver group you know shows that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
the receiver group you know shows that
they're<00:02:00.450> deep<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.079> play<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:02.610> but

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
they're deep and they can play but but

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
they're deep and they can play but but
still<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.329> too<00:02:03.539> many<00:02:03.750> balls<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.289> ground

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
still too too many balls on the ground

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.100 
still too too many balls on the ground
for<00:02:04.950> me<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.479> say<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> they're<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> know

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
for me to say that they're you know

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.699 
for me to say that they're you know
really<00:02:07.740> performing<00:02:08.399> well<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
really performing well and I think the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
really performing well and I think the
corner<00:02:10.950> corners<00:02:11.760> are<00:02:11.910> all<00:02:12.660> having<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.959> nice

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
corner corners are all having a nice

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.960 
corner corners are all having a nice
camp<00:02:13.470> there's<00:02:14.010> four<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.670> said<00:02:14.940> I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
camp there's four of them as I said I

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.880 
camp there's four of them as I said I
think<00:02:15.269> they<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:15.599> play<00:02:15.810> run<00:02:16.530> defense

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
think they can all play run defense

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.130 
think they can all play run defense
improved<00:02:17.750> improved<00:02:19.550> when<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:21.209> when<00:02:21.599> we<00:02:21.630> fit

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
improved improved when we when we fit

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
improved improved when we when we fit
well<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.349> carried<00:02:22.890> out<00:02:23.010> our<00:02:23.130> assignments<00:02:23.840> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
well and carried out our assignments you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.040 
well and carried out our assignments you
know<00:02:25.489> 11<00:02:26.489> out<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.610> 11<00:02:26.730> or<00:02:27.090> 10<00:02:27.239> out<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> 11<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.989> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
know 11 out of 11 or 10 out of 11 of the

know 11 out of 11 or 10 out of 11 of the
other<00:02:28.230> guys<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.739> certainly<00:02:29.010> played<00:02:29.250> better

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
other guys we certainly played better

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.940 
other guys we certainly played better
when<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.090> had<00:02:30.239> guys<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:31.019> were<00:02:31.200> were<00:02:31.709> not

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
when we had guys that that were were not

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.820 
when we had guys that that were were not
executed<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:34.080> opened<00:02:34.410> some<00:02:34.590> things

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
executed and then we opened some things

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.330 
executed and then we opened some things
up<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.430> overall<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.989> was<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.680> better

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
up but but overall it was it was better

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.420 
up but but overall it was it was better
it<00:02:39.239> was<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> first<00:02:39.739> day<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.769> we'd<00:02:41.069> really

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it was the first day that we'd really

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
it was the first day that we'd really
tackled<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.900> didn't<00:02:43.650> tackle<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.010> whole<00:02:44.160> time<00:02:44.340> I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
tackled I didn't tackle the whole time I

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.559 
tackled I didn't tackle the whole time I
play<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:46.110> over<00:02:46.140> half<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.400> I'd<00:02:48.030> what<00:02:48.330> I

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
play all over half of it I I'd what I

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.000 
play all over half of it I I'd what I
could<00:02:48.810> easily<00:02:49.079> find<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.319> exact<00:02:49.590> number<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
could easily find the exact number but I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.430 
could easily find the exact number but I
guess<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:51.299> bit<00:02:51.480> over<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> half<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.079> closer

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
guess a little bit over a half to closer

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160 
guess a little bit over a half to closer
to<00:02:52.650> two<00:02:53.280> thirds<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.940> actually<00:02:54.599> tackled

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
to two thirds that we actually tackled

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.759 
to two thirds that we actually tackled
to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> ground<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:56.160> didn't<00:02:56.400> tackle<00:02:56.579> great

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
to the ground and we didn't tackle great

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.440 
to the ground and we didn't tackle great
overall<00:02:58.769> not<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.549> not<00:02:59.849> as<00:02:59.880> well<00:03:00.180> certainly

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
overall not not as not as well certainly
