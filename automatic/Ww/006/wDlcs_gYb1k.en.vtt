00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.230 

now<00:00:01.380> we<00:00:01.439> are<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.570> thin<00:00:03.650> this<00:00:05.029> part<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
now we are going to thin this part of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.589 
now we are going to thin this part of
the<00:00:06.330> clay<00:00:06.569> i'm<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.740> make<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.280> a

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
the clay i'm going to make like a

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.680 
the clay i'm going to make like a
clothing<00:00:12.320> have<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.530> thin<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.280> lot<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.189 

this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.410> also<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.130> add<00:00:21.199> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
this is going to have also to add the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.490 
this is going to have also to add the
excess<00:00:22.769> strength<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> structure

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
excess strength to this to the structure

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.209 
excess strength to this to the structure
of<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:27.660> figuring<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.500> i<00:00:29.010> didn't<00:00:31.040> make<00:00:32.040> an

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
of this figuring that i didn't make an

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
of this figuring that i didn't make an
armature<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.010> easy<00:00:36.140> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
armature I just try to make it easy for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180 
armature I just try to make it easy for
me<00:00:37.320> an<00:00:37.469> easy<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.450> to<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.140> our<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.010> its

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
me an easy for you to because our to its

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.209 
me an easy for you to because our to its
obtained<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:42.030> later<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
obtained about later because you have to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.209 
obtained about later because you have to
take<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> off<00:00:45.120> before<00:00:45.960> rice<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.950> then

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
take it off before rice and then

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.939 
take it off before rice and then
probably<00:00:48.350> there<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.440> many<00:00:49.710> chance<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:51.949> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
probably there is many chance that you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.110 
probably there is many chance that you
or<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:54.210> break<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.989> figurine<00:00:55.969> taking<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
or me we break the figurine taking the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.360 
or me we break the figurine taking the
structure<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:59.899> let's<00:01:00.899> see

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.300 

how<00:01:04.370> this<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:04.940> going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.390> go<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:06.710> put<00:01:07.040> this

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
how this is going to go so we put this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:45.710 
how this is going to go so we put this
in<00:01:07.670> here

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440 

it's<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.460> field<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.390> are

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it's going to be the field and we are

00:01:48.450 --> 00:02:15.400 
it's going to be the field and we are
going<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.810> finish<00:01:49.050> later

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:35.990 

is

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.410 

no<00:02:36.740> just<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.890> me<00:02:39.020> guess<00:02:40.020> so

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
no just you me guess so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:52.190 
no just you me guess so
for<00:02:43.420> all

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.950 

ok
