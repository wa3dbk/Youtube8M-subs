here's<00:01:43.460> another<00:01:43.700> youtuber

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.180 

that's<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.510> real<00:01:49.930> past<00:01:50.170> 250<00:01:50.530> if<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.100> ever

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
that's a real past 250 if I ever

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's a real past 250 if I ever
have<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.490> get<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.820> 250<00:01:52.390> that's<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.810> get

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
have to get a 250 that's what I get

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
have to get a 250 that's what I get
actually<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:54.940> was<00:01:55.090> thinking<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.420> getting<00:01:55.600> our

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
actually I was thinking of getting our

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.800 
actually I was thinking of getting our
250<00:01:56.410> because<00:01:58.830> it's<00:01:59.830> lying<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.490> small<00:02:00.910> it's

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
250 because it's lying it's small it's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
250 because it's lying it's small it's
um<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.040> teaches<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.580> conserve<00:02:04.120> momentum

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
um it teaches you to conserve momentum

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300 
um it teaches you to conserve momentum
and<00:02:06.720> Kathy<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.990> just<00:02:08.440> teaches<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.920> how<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.190> use

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and Kathy it just teaches you how to use

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.780 
and Kathy it just teaches you how to use
the<00:02:09.550> momentum<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.270> your<00:02:10.420> advantage

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.390 

turkey<00:02:17.790> almost<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.240> few<00:02:18.480> above<00:02:19.040> trying<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> use

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
turkey almost a few above trying to use

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
turkey almost a few above trying to use
the<00:02:20.550> momentum<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.540> bicycling<00:02:22.080> you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the momentum just like bicycling you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
the momentum just like bicycling you
need<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.470> conserve<00:02:22.860> momentum<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:24.090> don't<00:02:24.270> have

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
need to conserve momentum you don't have

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.910 
need to conserve momentum you don't have
that<00:02:24.600> much<00:02:24.780> power<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.350> only<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that much power you only have like a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.890 
that much power you only have like a
third<00:02:26.250> horsepower<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.920> punk<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.600> even

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
third horsepower to do punk it and even

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.230 
third horsepower to do punk it and even
a<00:02:31.110> third<00:02:31.290> horse<00:02:31.590> part<00:02:31.860> last<00:02:32.250> person<00:02:32.670> last<00:02:32.880> more

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
a third horse part last person last more

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.440 
a third horse part last person last more
than<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.690> few<00:02:34.200> seconds

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 

but<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.500> reason<00:02:40.890> why<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.099> decided<00:02:41.459> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
but you know the reason why I decided to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
but you know the reason why I decided to
stick<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:43.050> thousand<00:02:43.500> CC<00:02:43.860> bark<00:02:44.129> is

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
stick with the thousand CC bark is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.420 
stick with the thousand CC bark is
beakers

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
beakers

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.580 
beakers
I<00:02:46.519> realized<00:02:47.359> one<00:02:47.569> thing<00:02:47.680> yeah

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 

the<00:02:56.160> price<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.760> much<00:02:56.970> different<00:02:57.450> really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the price is not much different really

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.559 
the price is not much different really
when<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> comes<00:02:58.560> down<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.980> buying<00:02:59.430> used<00:02:59.790> buying

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
when it comes down to buying used buying

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.320 
when it comes down to buying used buying
new<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> huge<00:03:01.890> difference<00:03:02.330> it's

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
new it's like a huge difference it's

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.040 
new it's like a huge difference it's
like<00:03:04.099> thousands<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.190> dollars<00:03:05.580> difference<00:03:06.050> but

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
like thousands of dollars difference but

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.170 
like thousands of dollars difference but
the<00:03:07.349> difference<00:03:08.160> between<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:10.040> 600<00:03:11.040> or<00:03:11.340> 750

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the difference between a 600 or 750

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.460 
the difference between a 600 or 750
versus<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> thousand<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.890> like<00:03:14.160> maybe<00:03:15.379> 1500<00:03:16.379> or

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
versus a thousand is like maybe 1500 or

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.330 
versus a thousand is like maybe 1500 or
2000<00:03:16.980> dollars<00:03:17.250> difference<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.340> decided

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
2000 dollars difference so I decided

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.700 
2000 dollars difference so I decided
well<00:03:20.810> here<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> thousand<00:03:22.290> cc<00:03:22.560> bike

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.380 

and<00:03:26.710> i<00:03:28.320> also<00:03:29.320> found<00:03:29.710> ivan<00:03:30.250> IV<00:03:30.610> chatting<00:03:31.090> i<00:03:31.180> made

there's not a lot of um like these
thousand<00:03:47.620> cc<00:03:47.890> bikes<00:03:48.160> are<00:03:48.310> really<00:03:48.610> expensive

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
thousand cc bikes are really expensive

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.930
