00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.790
 Spaniards is the second part of the review on the series 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.670

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.860
 company sl then with then chinese company 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.860
 let's start as soon as possible from the hill 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.720
 here are the figures collected let's see 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 first we have here, too, it seems a farmer you 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
 for some reason over the shovels we want you to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.880
 suit and somehow rewound country clouds 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.850
 but on the head utah only I will be by this 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.130
 part is a plunger or shop 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 but all this is very strange such a zombie 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.230
 where u made interesting but pretty 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 still funny assembly was pretty 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 still simple and everything was going easy 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.339
 the only difference from lego is these 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.580
 Here are the legs that do jumpers 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.979
 made and they are more rounded not like 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.300
 the leagues and in general the quality is good and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.150
 power is also very nice if bills 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.060
 zombie farmer such a red suit with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.550
 she has such a characteristic hat 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.580
 for farmers and also hoofs ax 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.860
 heart and bottom of the floor and he's pretty 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 the island could not become dangerous 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.740
 inject the dream of any pierce everything 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 ok so painted eyes all exactly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.159
 made such as the game came out and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.130
 every zombies have any such 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.260
 Circuits on the pedestal I do not know why they 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 they just like decorate maybe 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:54.720
 points you can dream up and 3 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 this road it seems he is with such a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.200
 road sign 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.110
 but in the picture he would have left here he 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.400
 some pink are you in narnia small 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.510
 the legs will help them and the fish 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.690
 small mini zombies a book too 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.420
 Well, yes, the evidence is also acute I do not know why he 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 where did he get some kind of antenna 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.400
 somewhere on her tore off there is no crushing 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.180
 plant don't know well 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.890
 it looks pretty funny and the most 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.439
 the main thing is that they have these pins right here 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.500
 all eyes are made exactly in contrast to 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.930
 previous figures it was the second 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.680
 final release on the series 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.060
 minifigures 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.430

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.489
 the previous series well, it's there in the stream 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.250
 After all, he can find in the whole figures 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.670
 not bad done there are cons but 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.709
 as well as here and advantages of the cl 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 there is a chinese manufacturer 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.420
 but honestly of course of course 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.430
 Well, this is not very normal but 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.629
 the figures themselves are unique and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.790
 and they will look good on the shelf 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.280
