00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
hi I'm Keith and on today's Vav learn

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.669 
hi I'm Keith and on today's Vav learn
segment<00:00:06.640> we're<00:00:07.360> going<00:00:07.600> to<00:00:07.750> do<00:00:07.900> an<00:00:08.019> overview<00:00:08.139> of

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:08.679 
segment we're going to do an overview of

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.810 
segment we're going to do an overview of
preparing<00:00:09.280> for<00:00:09.580> a<00:00:09.639> block<00:00:09.940> print<00:00:11.459> so<00:00:12.459> we<00:00:12.490> start

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
preparing for a block print so we start

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.819 
preparing for a block print so we start
with<00:00:13.030> our<00:00:13.059> block<00:00:13.509> in<00:00:14.079> this<00:00:14.169> case<00:00:14.379> it<00:00:14.589> isn't

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:14.829 
with our block in this case it isn't

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.980 
with our block in this case it isn't
true<00:00:15.429> million<00:00:15.940> but<00:00:16.090> it<00:00:16.209> is<00:00:16.330> a<00:00:16.360> beautiful<00:00:16.840> block

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
true million but it is a beautiful block

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.560 
true million but it is a beautiful block
you<00:00:17.890> take<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.850> block<00:00:19.030> that<00:00:19.240> you're<00:00:19.390> going<00:00:19.540> to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
you take the block that you're going to

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.260 
you take the block that you're going to
print<00:00:19.810> from<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.320> what<00:00:21.160> I<00:00:21.190> like<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.700> suggest

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
print from and what I like to suggest

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.970 
print from and what I like to suggest
all<00:00:22.420> the<00:00:22.540> time<00:00:22.690> is<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:22.930> actually<00:00:23.140> place<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.590> on

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
all the time is to actually place it on

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.730 
all the time is to actually place it on
a<00:00:24.040> piece<00:00:24.370> of<00:00:24.400> paper<00:00:24.610> trace<00:00:25.540> around<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:26.500> block

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
a piece of paper trace around the block

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.950 
a piece of paper trace around the block
so<00:00:27.010> now<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.820> have<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.180> parameters<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.780> what

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
so now you have the parameters of what

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.890 
so now you have the parameters of what
your<00:00:29.230> block<00:00:29.440> is<00:00:29.650> going<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:29.890> entail<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:31.150> through

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
your block is going to entail so through

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600 
your block is going to entail so through
the<00:00:31.960> magic<00:00:32.020> of<00:00:32.379> technology<00:00:32.950> about<00:00:33.070> any<00:00:33.400> time

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
the magic of technology about any time

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.510 
the magic of technology about any time
that's<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.940> headed<00:00:34.210> ID<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.829> is<00:00:36.130> actual

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
that's a headed ID and this is actual

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's a headed ID and this is actual
will<00:00:36.670> be<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.850> be<00:00:37.060> logo<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.260> word<00:00:38.410> member

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
will be a be logo and the word member

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.520 
will be a be logo and the word member
part<00:00:40.329> of<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.450> reason<00:00:40.630> I<00:00:40.720> did<00:00:40.870> this<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.200> we<00:00:41.320> will

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
part of the reason I did this is we will

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.010 
part of the reason I did this is we will
need<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:41.860> eventually<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.520> also<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:43.270> helps

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
need this eventually but also it helps

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.150 
need this eventually but also it helps
you<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.320> show<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.820> we<00:00:46.540> need<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.500> have<00:00:47.680> this<00:00:47.920> in

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
you to show that we need to have this in

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.950 
you to show that we need to have this in
Reverse<00:00:48.550> when<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:48.940> on<00:00:49.090> there<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:49.630> I<00:00:49.660> drew

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
Reverse when it's on there so I drew

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.540 
Reverse when it's on there so I drew
this<00:00:50.230> in<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:51.960> B<00:00:52.960> pencil<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.070> can<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.340> into

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
this in a B pencil so you can do it into

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.580 
this in a B pencil so you can do it into
the<00:00:54.670> year<00:00:54.790> forty<00:00:55.180> or<00:00:55.270> whatever<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.989> sake<00:00:56.230> led

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
the year forty or whatever the sake led

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.799 
the year forty or whatever the sake led
the<00:00:56.739> easier<00:00:57.040> transfers<00:00:58.590> so<00:01:00.149> I've<00:01:01.149> only<00:01:01.360> using

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
the easier transfers so I've only using

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.900 
the easier transfers so I've only using
the<00:01:01.930> small<00:01:02.170> corner<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.890> block<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.730> will

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
the small corner of the block and I will

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.100 
the small corner of the block and I will
be<00:01:04.000> cutting<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.360> block<00:01:04.950> away<00:01:05.950> after<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.930> can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
be cutting the block away after you can

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.830 
be cutting the block away after you can
see<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> logo<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.580> there<00:01:10.270> right

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
see that the logo is there right

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.570 
see that the logo is there right
readable<00:01:11.260> so<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.680> means<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.130> can<00:01:12.250> see<00:01:12.430> it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
readable so that means we can see it's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.840 
readable so that means we can see it's
VAB<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.270> member<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.680> will<00:01:15.100> be<00:01:15.220> taking<00:01:15.430> this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
VAB and member so I will be taking this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.670 
VAB and member so I will be taking this
and<00:01:16.090> flipping<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.750> because<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:17.560> on<00:01:17.650> a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
and flipping it because it's on a

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.560 
and flipping it because it's on a
translucent<00:01:18.460> piece<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.760> paper<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.420> see

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
translucent piece of paper I can see

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270 
translucent piece of paper I can see
where<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.810> need<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.110> put<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:20.470> on<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.740> block<00:01:20.950> I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
where I need to put it on the block I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.690 
where I need to put it on the block I
line<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.420> up<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.840> where<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.049> need<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.770> now

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
line that up to where I need and now

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.780 
line that up to where I need and now
what<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.630> there<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.170> reversed<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.310> as<00:01:27.580> I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
what is there is reversed so as I

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.399 
what is there is reversed so as I
transfer<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.270> now<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.450> can<00:01:28.690> take<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> lid<00:01:29.170> and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
transfer it now I can take the lid and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.230 
transfer it now I can take the lid and
draw<00:01:29.710> over<00:01:29.979> every<00:01:30.430> little<00:01:30.670> thing<00:01:30.790> but<00:01:30.820> because

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
draw over every little thing but because

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600 
draw over every little thing but because
I<00:01:31.390> did<00:01:31.570> use<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> soft<00:01:32.229> lid<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.740> will<00:01:33.280> be<00:01:33.400> able<00:01:33.460> to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
I did use a soft lid I will be able to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.670 
I did use a soft lid I will be able to
just<00:01:33.820> use<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.180> other<00:01:34.330> end<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.049> pencil<00:01:35.260> and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
just use the other end of the pencil and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.080 
just use the other end of the pencil and
quicker<00:01:37.049> method<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.710> do<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:39.820> get

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
quicker method is to do this so I get

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.469 
quicker method is to do this so I get
everything<00:01:40.299> transferred<00:01:41.400> very<00:01:42.400> fast<00:01:42.760> because

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
everything transferred very fast because

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.929 
everything transferred very fast because
I'm<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.170> having<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.619> follow<00:01:44.770> exactly<00:01:45.549> now<00:01:45.880> you

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
I'm not having to follow exactly now you

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.170 
I'm not having to follow exactly now you
could<00:01:46.330> very<00:01:46.689> easily<00:01:46.780> follow<00:01:47.439> exactly<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.280> one

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
could very easily follow exactly and one

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.940 
could very easily follow exactly and one
advantage<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.750> doing<00:01:49.869> it<00:01:50.080> exactly<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.710> know

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
advantage of doing it exactly you know

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.160 
advantage of doing it exactly you know
you've<00:01:51.159> covered<00:01:51.700> every<00:01:52.060> area<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.140> a

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
you've covered every area this is a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.310 
you've covered every area this is a
broad<00:01:53.530> stroke<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.210> do<00:01:55.360> sometimes<00:01:55.810> if<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.290> am

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
broad stroke what I do sometimes if I am

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.609 
broad stroke what I do sometimes if I am
drawing<00:01:56.920> over<00:01:57.369> top<00:01:57.670> i<00:01:57.970> maybe<00:01:58.630> use<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.900> color<00:01:59.320> so

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
drawing over top i maybe use a color so

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.170 
drawing over top i maybe use a color so
i<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.250> say<00:02:00.490> blue<00:02:00.729> or<00:02:00.909> green<00:02:01.150> or

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
i can like say blue or green or

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.090 
i can like say blue or green or
something<00:02:01.450> like<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.500> see<00:02:02.710> for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
something like that so I can see for

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.390 
something like that so I can see for
sure<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.710> selected<00:02:05.710> all<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.860> areas

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
sure that I you selected all the areas

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.980 
sure that I you selected all the areas
so<00:02:06.640> before<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.000> take<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.360> away<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.540> would<00:02:07.840> look<00:02:07.930> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
so before I take it away I would look to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.990 
so before I take it away I would look to
see

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
see

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.610 
see
I<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.149> need<00:02:10.509> just<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.960> couple<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.320> little<00:02:11.470> bit

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
I do need just a couple of little bit

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.760 
I do need just a couple of little bit
areas<00:02:11.980> there<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.460> didn't<00:02:13.150> quite<00:02:13.360> turn<00:02:13.570> out

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
areas there that didn't quite turn out

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.260 
areas there that didn't quite turn out
so<00:02:14.770> I'll<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.070> again<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.550> that's<00:02:15.700> why<00:02:16.240> I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
so I'll do it again and that's why I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.360 
so I'll do it again and that's why I
hold<00:02:16.720> my<00:02:16.960> fingers<00:02:17.350> there<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.950> keep<00:02:18.100> everything

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
hold my fingers there to keep everything

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.700 
hold my fingers there to keep everything
in<00:02:18.580> place<00:02:18.790> until<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.570> know<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:20.680> I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
in place until I know that I have what I

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.290 
in place until I know that I have what I
want<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:22.270> again<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.440> lighter<00:02:24.400> line<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.000> from

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
want and again a lighter line that from

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.560 
want and again a lighter line that from
before<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.990> just<00:02:26.550> do<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.700> harder<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.420> now<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
before I just do it harder now so now I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.990 
before I just do it harder now so now I
have<00:02:31.810> enough<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.350> demo<00:02:32.530> purposes<00:02:33.100> I'll

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
have enough for the demo purposes I'll

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.390 
have enough for the demo purposes I'll
put<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.330> aside<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.500> got<00:02:35.740> three<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.070> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
put that aside so I got three of the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.560 
put that aside so I got three of the
tool<00:02:36.840> cutting<00:02:37.840> tools<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.350> first<00:02:39.220> one

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
tool cutting tools out first one

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.490 
tool cutting tools out first one
v-groove<00:02:40.570> that's<00:02:40.870> very<00:02:41.080> fine

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
v-groove that's very fine

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.010 
v-groove that's very fine
second<00:02:41.770> one<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.070> v-groove<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.630> broader

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
second one a v-groove that is broader

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.520 
second one a v-groove that is broader
and<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.740> third<00:02:44.890> one<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> rounded<00:02:46.530> cutting

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and the third one is a rounded cutting

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.590 
and the third one is a rounded cutting
tool<00:02:47.709> these<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.400> similar<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.820> what<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.060> could

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
tool these are similar to what you could

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.660 
tool these are similar to what you could
cut<00:02:49.780> into<00:02:50.080> wood<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.560> everything<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:50.980> -<00:02:51.220> but

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
cut into wood and everything but - but

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.090 
cut into wood and everything but - but
they<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.910> meant<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.390> cutting<00:02:53.200> blocks<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.040> I

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
they are meant for cutting blocks so I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.850 
they are meant for cutting blocks so I
will<00:02:54.280> start<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.720> show<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:55.930> how<00:02:56.050> easy<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.680> to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
will start to show you how easy it is to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.680 
will start to show you how easy it is to
God<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.010> will<00:02:57.250> start<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> finer<00:02:58.030> tool<00:02:58.360> and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
God I will start with the finer tool and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.830 
God I will start with the finer tool and
just<00:02:59.410> do<00:02:59.590> some<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.820> detail<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.750> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
just do some of the detail here so you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.770 
just do some of the detail here so you
can<00:03:01.990> see<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.670> middle<00:03:04.120> part<00:03:04.300> here<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
can see so the middle part here is a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260 
can see so the middle part here is a
pencil<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.130> going<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.490> cut<00:03:06.640> along<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
pencil so I'm going to cut along the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.920 
pencil so I'm going to cut along the
edge<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.810> line<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.480> LED<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
edge of the line to the LED of the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.490 
edge of the line to the LED of the
pencil<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:12.100> just<00:03:12.430> remove<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.500> cut

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
pencil and then just remove that cut

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.670 
pencil and then just remove that cut
across<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.730> base<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.930> cut<00:03:17.140> section<00:03:17.380> of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
across the base of the cut section of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.500 
across the base of the cut section of
the<00:03:17.739> pencil<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.510> remove<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:21.510> cut

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the pencil and remove that and then cut

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.530 
the pencil and remove that and then cut
back

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.339 

to<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.379> line<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:27.950> just<00:03:28.189> cut<00:03:28.459> now<00:03:29.349> for

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
to the line that I just cut now for

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.319 
to the line that I just cut now for
demonstration<00:03:30.500> purposes<00:03:31.129> I'm<00:03:31.670> not<00:03:31.879> using<00:03:32.239> a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
demonstration purposes I'm not using a

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.539 
demonstration purposes I'm not using a
safety<00:03:32.569> here<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.140> am<00:03:33.799> very<00:03:34.099> safety

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
safety here and I am very safety

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.599 
safety here and I am very safety
conscious<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:35.810> actually<00:03:36.609> could

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
conscious but I can actually could

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.199 
conscious but I can actually could
actually<00:03:37.879> be<00:03:38.239> using<00:03:38.629> a<00:03:39.519> natural<00:03:40.519> safety<00:03:41.030> tool

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
actually be using a natural safety tool

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.330 
actually be using a natural safety tool
here<00:03:41.599> but<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.230> thought<00:03:42.439> this<00:03:42.650> way<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.859> can<00:03:43.099> see

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
here but I thought this way you can see

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.179 
here but I thought this way you can see
how<00:03:43.609> I'm<00:03:43.790> cutting<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.329> little<00:03:44.840> bit<00:03:44.989> easier<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.159> I

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
how I'm cutting a little bit easier so I

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.619 
how I'm cutting a little bit easier so I
cut<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:47.239> outlines<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.200> then<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.189> take

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
cut the outlines of that then I can take

00:03:49.629 --> 00:04:04.010 
cut the outlines of that then I can take
the<00:03:51.280> wider<00:03:52.280> one<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.879> now<00:03:53.389> cut<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.750> those<00:03:54.200> lines

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.770 

and<00:04:04.290> see<00:04:04.980> how<00:04:05.100> easily<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:06.120> was<00:04:06.330> cut<00:04:06.570> now<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and see how easily that was cut now I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.570 
and see how easily that was cut now I
still<00:04:07.170> haven't<00:04:07.500> found<00:04:07.650> here<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.250> just

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
still haven't found here that I just

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.540 
still haven't found here that I just
want<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> take<00:04:09.240> that<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:10.200> rid<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:12.770> so<00:04:13.850> with<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
want to take that you rid of so with the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.000 
want to take that you rid of so with the
the<00:04:17.550> wider<00:04:17.820> groove<00:04:18.300> I'm<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.560> cut<00:04:19.770> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
the wider groove I'm going to cut the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.710 
the wider groove I'm going to cut the
edge<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.550> a<00:04:20.700> letter<00:04:20.880> beaten<00:04:21.180> now<00:04:21.300> one<00:04:21.540> thing

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
edge of a letter beaten now one thing

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.350 
edge of a letter beaten now one thing
that<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.440> haven't<00:04:22.650> anticipated<00:04:22.920> here<00:04:23.790> what's

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
that I haven't anticipated here what's

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.290 
that I haven't anticipated here what's
how<00:04:24.710> Nestle<00:04:25.710> yeah<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.490> transfer<00:04:26.880> but<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.150> can

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
how Nestle yeah the transfer but I can

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600 
how Nestle yeah the transfer but I can
see<00:04:27.420> where<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.660> going<00:04:27.870> still<00:04:28.170> so<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.460> might

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
see where it going still so you might

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.390 
see where it going still so you might
not<00:04:29.790> want<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.120> use<00:04:30.180> too<00:04:30.870> soft<00:04:31.140> lid<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.310> I'm

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
not want to use too soft lid so I'm

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.360 
not want to use too soft lid so I'm
going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.610> cut<00:04:32.760> down<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.720> edge<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.230> now<00:04:34.920> I<00:04:34.980> am

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
going to cut down the edge here now I am

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.580 
going to cut down the edge here now I am
cutting<00:04:35.610> towards<00:04:36.120> me<00:04:36.390> which<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> no-no<00:04:37.320> but

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
cutting towards me which is a no-no but

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.030 
cutting towards me which is a no-no but
I<00:04:37.770> am<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.790> be<00:04:39.690> very<00:04:40.020> careful<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.710> kept

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
I am going to be very careful and kept

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.080 
I am going to be very careful and kept
my<00:04:41.160> thumb<00:04:41.400> out<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.760> way<00:04:41.910> from<00:04:42.780> getting<00:04:43.110> cut

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
my thumb out of the way from getting cut

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.570 
my thumb out of the way from getting cut
because<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.480> sell<00:04:46.050> them<00:04:46.170> have<00:04:46.440> cut<00:04:46.980> myself<00:04:47.190> in

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
because I sell them have cut myself in

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.790 
because I sell them have cut myself in
any<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.270> these<00:04:48.390> techniques<00:04:48.780> but<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.590> don't

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
any of these techniques but you don't

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.730 
any of these techniques but you don't
want<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.160> because<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.550> hurts<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:51.090> now<00:04:52.020> again

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
want to because it hurts it now again

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.910 
want to because it hurts it now again
I'm<00:04:52.980> going<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> cut<00:04:53.400> around<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:55.170> see<00:04:55.440> how<00:04:55.590> easy

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
I'm going to cut around and see how easy

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560 
I'm going to cut around and see how easy
that's<00:04:56.250> cutting<00:04:56.700> if<00:04:57.240> you're<00:04:57.420> using

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
that's cutting if you're using

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.110 
that's cutting if you're using
battleship<00:04:58.350> linoleum<00:04:59.010> it's<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.670> little<00:04:59.970> bit

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
battleship linoleum it's a little bit

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.840 
battleship linoleum it's a little bit
more<00:05:00.360> difficult<00:05:00.870> than<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.950> true<00:05:02.250> vinyl

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
more difficult than this the true vinyl

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.940 
more difficult than this the true vinyl
little<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.600> it's<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.410> little<00:05:04.650> bit<00:05:04.770> more

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
little you it's a little bit more

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.200 
little you it's a little bit more
difficult<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.670> little<00:05:05.940> harder

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
difficult because is a little harder

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.230 
difficult because is a little harder
this<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:08.630> between<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:10.100> white<00:05:11.100> eraser<00:05:11.370> int<00:05:11.910> in

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
this is between a white eraser int in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.700 
this is between a white eraser int in
density<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.520> truline<00:05:14.940> block<00:05:15.710> that

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
density and the the truline block that

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.850 
density and the the truline block that
it's<00:05:17.250> called<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.700> battleship<00:05:18.600> linoleum<00:05:19.170> so

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
it's called the battleship linoleum so

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.790 
it's called the battleship linoleum so
this<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.250> an<00:05:20.370> easier<00:05:20.700> one<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.360> do<00:05:21.570> then<00:05:22.380> it

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
this is an easier one to do then it

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.250 
this is an easier one to do then it
would<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.190> with<00:05:23.370> battleship<00:05:23.880> but<00:05:24.840> it's<00:05:25.050> a

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
would be with battleship but it's a

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.800 
would be with battleship but it's a
slightly<00:05:25.620> denser<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.610> it's<00:05:26.820> going<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.090> hold<00:05:27.600> up

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
slightly denser so it's going to hold up

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.170 
slightly denser so it's going to hold up
even<00:05:28.170> longer<00:05:28.410> than<00:05:28.770> if<00:05:29.250> I'm<00:05:29.370> using<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.940> type

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
even longer than if I'm using the type

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.740 
even longer than if I'm using the type
that's<00:05:30.450> up<00:05:30.600> there<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.530> actually

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
that's up there that is actually

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
that's up there that is actually
actually<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.680> same<00:05:34.920> consistency<00:05:35.490> as<00:05:35.610> a<00:05:35.700> white

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
actually the same consistency as a white

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:44.290 
actually the same consistency as a white
racing

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.360 

you
