00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.849 
all right so I'm here I'm going to talk
about<00:00:02.010> muscle<00:00:02.460> activity<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.090> gait<00:00:03.270> cycle

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
about muscle activity in the gait cycle

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.839 
about muscle activity in the gait cycle
so<00:00:04.859> starting<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.549> actually<00:00:06.240> just<00:00:06.450> prior<00:00:06.870> to

also going to be on its stance for the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
also going to be on its stance for the
same<00:00:36.360> reason<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> weight<00:00:37.559> only

they're<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> frontal<00:00:38.550> plane<00:00:38.670> instead<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they're at the frontal plane instead of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.430 
they're at the frontal plane instead of
the<00:00:39.239> sagittal<00:00:39.600> plane<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> gluteus

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the sagittal plane like the gluteus

the sagittal plane like the gluteus
maximus<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.790> also<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.270> your

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
maximus and then you also have your

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.209 
maximus and then you also have your
quadriceps<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.770> active

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and they're going to be active to take

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
and they're going to be active to take
the<00:00:45.660> weight<00:00:45.840> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> knee<00:00:46.410> okay<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.530> you're

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
control that hip extension okay
and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.869> they're<00:01:49.049> going

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and then as you and then they're going

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
and then as you and then they're going
to<00:01:49.200> turn<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:49.979> contentedly<00:01:50.579> active

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to turn around and be contentedly active

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
to turn around and be contentedly active
to<00:01:51.240> begin<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> swing<00:01:51.930> phase<00:01:52.200> okay

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
to begin the swing phase okay

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
to begin the swing phase okay
so<00:01:53.909> again<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> hip<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> hip<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so again at the hip at the hip in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.220 
so again at the hip at the hip in
particular<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.750> hamstrings

you have the gluteus maximus

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160 
you have the gluteus maximus
concentrically<00:02:02.760> active<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:03.990> your

weight<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.950> medius<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.400> minimus

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
weight and then the medius and minimus

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.780 
weight and then the medius and minimus
also<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> help<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.140> weight<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.490> then

quadricep muscle they're going to be
active<00:02:16.410> eccentric<00:02:17.070> lee<00:02:17.250> okay<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.790> remember

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
active eccentric lee okay so remember

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
active eccentric lee okay so remember
you're<00:02:18.270> flexing<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:18.990> bit<00:02:19.110> you're<00:02:19.260> added

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
you're flexing a little bit you're added

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.080 
you're flexing a little bit you're added
a<00:02:19.710> little<00:02:19.860> bit<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> take<00:02:20.910> your

a little bit they want to take your

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670 
a little bit they want to take your
weight<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> gentle<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.470> thing

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
weight so it's a gentle kind of thing

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.230 
weight so it's a gentle kind of thing
then<00:02:23.220> they're<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> turn<00:02:23.730> around<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
then they're going to turn around and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.460 
then they're going to turn around and
kind<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.450> straighten<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> back<00:02:24.990> up<00:02:25.140> again

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
kind of straighten you back up again

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.170 
kind of straighten you back up again
okay<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:27.450> hip<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.770> hip<00:02:28.800> flexors<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.730> going

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
okay the hip the hip flexors are going

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.290 
okay the hip the hip flexors are going
to<00:02:30.240> turn<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.570> not<00:02:30.900> until<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.880> until<00:02:33.120> mid

to turn on not until not until mid
stance<00:02:33.600> when<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.080> begin<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> extend<00:02:35.220> they're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
stance when you begin to extend they're

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.860 
stance when you begin to extend they're
going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.790> active<00:02:36.120> essentially<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
going to be active essentially to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.300 
going to be active essentially to
control<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> they're<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.070> turn

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
control that and they're going to turn

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
control that and they're going to turn
around<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.000> constantly<00:02:39.390> active<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.110> pull

around and be constantly active to pull

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.390 
around and be constantly active to pull
your<00:02:40.410> femur<00:02:40.710> forward<00:02:41.960> at<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.170> ankle<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.250> as

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
your femur forward at the ankle so as

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
your femur forward at the ankle so as
you<00:02:44.550> bring<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.790> your<00:02:45.390> foot<00:02:45.780> down<00:02:46.050> okay<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
you bring your your foot down okay and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.850 
you bring your your foot down okay and
you<00:02:47.220> slowly<00:02:47.550> lower<00:02:47.820> your<00:02:48.030> foot<00:02:48.860> that's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you slowly lower your foot that's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.100 
you slowly lower your foot that's
actually<00:02:50.490> your<00:02:51.170> as<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.560> lower<00:02:53.010> yourself<00:02:53.220> into

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
actually your as you lower yourself into

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.740 
actually your as you lower yourself into
plantar<00:02:55.110> flexion<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:56.130> your<00:02:56.430> anterior<00:02:57.420> tip

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
plantar flexion that's your anterior tip

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.780 
plantar flexion that's your anterior tip
which<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.260> active<00:02:58.590> eccentric<00:02:59.130> Lee<00:02:59.280> remember

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
which is active eccentric Lee remember

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.910 
which is active eccentric Lee remember
to<00:02:59.880> control<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.300> plantar<00:03:00.660> flexion<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.290> you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
to control that plantar flexion as you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.070 
to control that plantar flexion as you
go<00:03:02.130> through<00:03:02.400> stance<00:03:02.790> phase<00:03:03.120> most<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> stance

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
go through stance phase most of stance

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.470 
go through stance phase most of stance
phase<00:03:04.350> you're<00:03:04.620> actually<00:03:05.130> dorsi<00:03:05.580> flexing<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
phase you're actually dorsi flexing and

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.510 
phase you're actually dorsi flexing and
that's<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.959> controlled<00:03:07.530> dorsal<00:03:08.010> flexion<00:03:08.130> with

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
that's a controlled dorsal flexion with

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.580 
that's a controlled dorsal flexion with
gravity<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.240> it's<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.630> planner<00:03:09.930> flexors

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
gravity so it's your planner flexors

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.230 
gravity so it's your planner flexors
which<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.130> your<00:03:11.280> gastric<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.880> your<00:03:11.970> soleus

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
which is your gastric and your soleus

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
which is your gastric and your soleus
that<00:03:12.959> are<00:03:13.080> controlling<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.770> tibial

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that are controlling that tibial

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
that are controlling that tibial
movement<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.570> gastric<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> soleus

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
movement so the gastric and the soleus

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.699 
movement so the gastric and the soleus
are<00:03:17.100> going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.520> be<00:03:18.260> essentially<00:03:19.260> active

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
are going to be essentially active

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.100 
are going to be essentially active
through<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.130> Stan's<00:03:20.430> phase<00:03:20.760> until<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.959> do

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
through that Stan's phase until you do

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.229 
through that Stan's phase until you do
push<00:03:22.380> off<00:03:22.650> ice<00:03:23.190> remember<00:03:23.610> we<00:03:23.730> said<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:23.970> you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
push off ice remember we said that you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.090 
push off ice remember we said that you
are<00:03:24.630> Dorsey's<00:03:25.200> boxing<00:03:25.530> until<00:03:25.650> your<00:03:25.860> plantar

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
are Dorsey's boxing until your plantar

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.010 
are Dorsey's boxing until your plantar
flexing<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:27.060> they're<00:03:27.209> getting<00:03:27.330> controlled<00:03:27.810> at

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
flexing so they're getting controlled at

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.600 
flexing so they're getting controlled at
dorsiflexion<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.040> they're<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> turn

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
dorsiflexion and they're going to turn

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.640 
dorsiflexion and they're going to turn
around<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> content<00:03:31.020> really<00:03:31.110> active<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
around and be content really active to

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.650 
around and be content really active to
push<00:03:31.860> off<00:03:32.989> also<00:03:33.989> at<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.260> at<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> foot<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.190> as

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
push off also at the at the foot now as

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.840 
push off also at the at the foot now as
you<00:03:36.660> put<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.020> foot<00:03:37.830> down

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
you put your foot down

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.240 
you put your foot down
remember<00:03:39.360> you're<00:03:39.510> averting<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.920> even

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
remember you're averting your even

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.830 
remember you're averting your even
through<00:03:41.489> stance<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.180> invert<00:03:42.600> right

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
through stance and then you invert right

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.880 
through stance and then you invert right
before<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> push<00:03:43.440> off

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
before you push off

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
before you push off
that's<00:03:44.400> all<00:03:44.640> controlled<00:03:45.090> by<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.270> posterior

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
that's all controlled by the posterior

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.840 
that's all controlled by the posterior
tip<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.709> posterior<00:03:47.100> tip<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.489> your<00:03:47.610> primary

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
tip so the posterior tip is your primary

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.479 
tip so the posterior tip is your primary
inverter<00:03:48.450> okay<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.830> as<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.010> bring<00:03:50.310> your

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
inverter okay so as you bring your

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.370 
inverter okay so as you bring your
weight<00:03:50.700> down<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.480> posterior<00:03:51.870> tips<00:03:52.200> go<00:03:52.350> to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
weight down the posterior tips go to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.290 
weight down the posterior tips go to
control<00:03:52.920> control<00:03:53.430> control<00:03:53.459> your<00:03:54.000> aversion

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
control control control your aversion

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.229 
control control control your aversion
and<00:03:54.750> that's<00:03:55.260> going<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.500> turn<00:03:55.709> around<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.430> act

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
and that's going to turn around and act

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.290 
and that's going to turn around and act
content<00:03:57.930> triply<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.940> supinate<00:03:59.940> the<00:03:59.970> foot

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
content triply to supinate the foot

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.720 
content triply to supinate the foot
prepared<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.900> push<00:04:01.080> off

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
prepared for push off

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.430 
prepared for push off
so<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.060> thing<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.360> think<00:04:02.390> about<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:03.080> as<00:04:03.319> you

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
so the thing to think about is as you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.839 
so the thing to think about is as you
can<00:04:03.620> tell<00:04:03.830> there's<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.099> lot<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.430> east-central

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
can tell there's a lot of east-central

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.650 
can tell there's a lot of east-central
followed<00:04:05.360> by<00:04:05.450> Khan<00:04:05.690> Center<00:04:06.200> okay<00:04:06.709> so<00:04:07.450> at<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
followed by Khan Center okay so at the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.770 
followed by Khan Center okay so at the
at<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.170> knee<00:04:09.440> at<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.860> quads<00:04:10.780> they're

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
at the knee at the quads they're

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.270 
at the knee at the quads they're
primarily<00:04:12.170> responsible<00:04:12.349> for<00:04:12.739> controlling

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
primarily responsible for controlling

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.220 
primarily responsible for controlling
your<00:04:13.520> weight<00:04:13.790> okay<00:04:14.300> so<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.750> Eastern<00:04:15.080> truck

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
your weight okay so that Eastern truck

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.259 
your weight okay so that Eastern truck
activity<00:04:15.709> when<00:04:15.830> you<00:04:15.890> first<00:04:16.100> start<00:04:16.370> stands<00:04:16.820> and

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
activity when you first start stands and

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.550 
activity when you first start stands and
they'll<00:04:17.419> turn<00:04:17.570> around<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.930> be<00:04:17.989> content<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.470> be

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
they'll turn around and be content to be

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.190 
they'll turn around and be content to be
active<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.070> hold<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.489> up<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.239> posterior<00:04:20.660> tib

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
active to hold you up the posterior tib

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.960 
active to hold you up the posterior tib
is<00:04:21.380> going<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.680> essentially<00:04:22.310> acted<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.760> take

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
is going to be essentially acted to take

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.430 
is going to be essentially acted to take
the<00:04:23.150> weight<00:04:23.300> at<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.480> foot<00:04:23.900> really<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.350> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
the weight at the foot really in the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.140 
the weight at the foot really in the
same<00:04:24.650> way<00:04:24.830> as<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.980> progress<00:04:25.220> up<00:04:25.550> muscle<00:04:25.940> and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
same way as a progress up muscle and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.370 
same way as a progress up muscle and
then<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.690> going<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.870> turn<00:04:27.050> around<00:04:27.290> any

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
then it's going to turn around any

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.870 
then it's going to turn around any
Content<00:04:27.950> you'll<00:04:28.040> be<00:04:28.130> active<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.520> help<00:04:28.700> push

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
Content you'll be active to help push

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.950 
Content you'll be active to help push
you<00:04:29.060> off<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:31.000> anterior<00:04:32.000> tip<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.600> going<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.840> be

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
you off the anterior tip is going to be

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960 
you off the anterior tip is going to be
essentially<00:04:33.860> active<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.340> kind<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.550> lower<00:04:34.729> that

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
essentially active to kind of lower that

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.969 
essentially active to kind of lower that
foot<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.570> then<00:04:36.080> eventually<00:04:36.350> when<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.770> get<00:04:36.889> to

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
foot and then eventually when you get to

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.440 
foot and then eventually when you get to
swing<00:04:37.310> you'll<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:37.669> some<00:04:37.850> contract<00:04:38.210> activity

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
swing you'll have some contract activity

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.110 
swing you'll have some contract activity
to<00:04:38.690> help<00:04:38.870> lift<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.260> up<00:04:39.490> one<00:04:40.490> mostly<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:40.940> don't

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
to help lift it up one mostly you don't

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.940 
to help lift it up one mostly you don't
hear<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.300> lot<00:04:41.360> about<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:41.990> hamstring<00:04:42.590> muscle

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
hear a lot about is the hamstring muscle

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.500 
hear a lot about is the hamstring muscle
and<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.310> answering<00:04:43.700> muscles<00:04:44.150> are<00:04:44.300> not

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
and the answering muscles are not

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.930 
and the answering muscles are not
actually<00:04:45.110> super<00:04:45.560> important<00:04:46.100> for<00:04:46.130> gait<00:04:46.460> per<00:04:46.700> se

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
actually super important for gait per se

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.120 
actually super important for gait per se
the<00:04:47.600> only<00:04:47.660> time<00:04:48.020> they're<00:04:48.200> really<00:04:48.500> active<00:04:48.950> is

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
the only time they're really active is

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.780 
the only time they're really active is
like<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.430> said<00:04:49.700> when<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.389> go<00:04:50.570> into<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:52.550> heel

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
like I said when you go into that heel

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.340 
like I said when you go into that heel
strike<00:04:53.150> they're<00:04:53.360> going<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.540> they<00:04:53.900> actually

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
strike they're going to they actually

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.260 
strike they're going to they actually
kind<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:54.740> slow<00:04:54.950> down<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.400> whole<00:04:55.580> leg<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:56.120> get

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
kind of slow down the whole leg to get

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.510 
kind of slow down the whole leg to get
you<00:04:56.419> ready<00:04:56.600> we<00:04:57.350> call<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.770> heel<00:04:57.950> strike<00:04:58.340> but

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
you ready we call it a heel strike but

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.430 
you ready we call it a heel strike but
it's<00:04:58.639> actually<00:04:59.000> very<00:04:59.030> controlled<00:04:59.780> integrate

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
it's actually very controlled integrate

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.680 
it's actually very controlled integrate
it's<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:01.070> very<00:05:01.639> controlled<00:05:02.090> movement<00:05:02.479> it's

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
it's a very controlled movement it's

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.870 
it's a very controlled movement it's
controlled<00:05:03.080> by<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.260> hamstrings<00:05:03.889> but<00:05:04.490> outside

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
controlled by the hamstrings but outside

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.969 
controlled by the hamstrings but outside
of<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:05.090> they're<00:05:05.510> not<00:05:05.690> super<00:05:06.140> active<00:05:06.620> the

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
of that they're not super active the

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.360 
of that they're not super active the
flexion<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.610> happens<00:05:08.060> when<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.300> transition

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
flexion that happens when you transition

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.610 
flexion that happens when you transition

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.980 
swing doesn't come from active hamstring
activity<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:16.039> comes<00:05:16.340> primarily<00:05:17.000> through

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
activity it comes primarily through

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.170 
activity it comes primarily through
intersegmental<00:05:18.830> forces<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.760> passive

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
intersegmental forces and passive

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.840 
intersegmental forces and passive
tension<00:05:20.600> okay<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.620> once<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.340> start<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
tension okay and once you start the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.190 
tension okay and once you start the
swing<00:05:23.060> phase<00:05:23.390> but<00:05:23.660> like<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:23.840> said<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.169> have

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
swing phase but like I said you have

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.140 
swing phase but like I said you have
your<00:05:24.410> hip<00:05:24.530> flexors<00:05:24.890> to<00:05:25.010> get<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.220> started<00:05:25.669> you

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
your hip flexors to get you started you

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.250 
your hip flexors to get you started you
have<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.270> little<00:05:26.360> bit<00:05:26.510> activity<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:26.990> foot<00:05:27.169> to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
have a little bit activity the foot to

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.350 
have a little bit activity the foot to
hold<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.590> up<00:05:27.710> basically<00:05:28.550> momentum<00:05:28.669> takes<00:05:29.240> you

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
hold it up basically momentum takes you

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.430 
hold it up basically momentum takes you
forward<00:05:29.660> from<00:05:30.020> there

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
forward from there

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.430 
forward from there
okay<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:30.950> that<00:05:31.190> phase<00:05:31.430> from<00:05:31.820> post<00:05:32.690> early<00:05:33.110> swing

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
okay so that phase from post early swing

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.440 
okay so that phase from post early swing
until<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:34.070> start<00:05:34.340> preparing<00:05:34.460> for<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:35.180> next

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
until you start preparing for that next

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.990 
until you start preparing for that next
heel<00:05:35.750> strike<00:05:36.140> is<00:05:36.320> mostly<00:05:36.979> just<00:05:37.250> momentum<00:05:37.520> and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
heel strike is mostly just momentum and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.300 
heel strike is mostly just momentum and
there's<00:05:38.150> not<00:05:38.330> a<00:05:38.390> lot<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.600> activity<00:05:39.169> in<00:05:39.410> that

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
there's not a lot of activity in that

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.980 
there's not a lot of activity in that
phase

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
phase

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.699 
phase
that's<00:05:41.350> muscle<00:05:41.500> activity<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:42.070> Fiat<00:05:42.370> cycle
