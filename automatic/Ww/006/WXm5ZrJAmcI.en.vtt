and<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.670> problem<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.209> most<00:03:44.330> people<00:03:44.780> have

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and the problem that most people have

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.770 
and the problem that most people have
when<00:03:45.650> transitioning<00:03:46.130> into<00:03:46.519> black<00:03:46.820> ops<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
when transitioning into black ops is the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.620 
when transitioning into black ops is the
black<00:03:48.019> ops<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.440> little<00:03:48.800> bit<00:03:48.950> harder<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.280> play

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
black ops is a little bit harder to play

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.090 
black ops is a little bit harder to play
all<00:03:50.630> right<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.200> facts<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.860> little

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
all right that's the facts it's a little

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.580 
all right that's the facts it's a little
bit<00:03:52.190> harder<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.519> play<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.780> can't<00:03:54.019> do<00:03:54.200> epic

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
bit harder to play and you can't do epic

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.840 
bit harder to play and you can't do epic
360<00:03:55.549> quickscopes<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:58.220> if<00:03:58.340> you're<00:03:58.459> playing<00:03:58.700> a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
360 quickscopes but if you're playing a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.130 
360 quickscopes but if you're playing a
game<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.450> need<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.660> be<00:03:59.720> shot<00:03:59.959> dead

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
game for that you need to be shot dead

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.830 
game for that you need to be shot dead
anyways<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.549> problem<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.090> when<00:04:02.720> you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
anyways so the problem is when you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.420 
anyways so the problem is when you
transition<00:04:03.440> from<00:04:03.470> modern<00:04:03.890> warfare<00:04:04.040> 2<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
transition from modern warfare 2 in a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.160 
transition from modern warfare 2 in a
black<00:04:04.640> box<00:04:04.790> because<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.330> game<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> little

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
black box because the game is a little

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.660 
black box because the game is a little
bit<00:04:06.290> harder<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.680> get<00:04:06.799> kills<00:04:07.100> which<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.489> is

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
bit harder to get kills which it is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.070 
bit harder to get kills which it is
nothing<00:04:08.209> trying<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.570> argue<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.989> you're

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080
