00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
turning on the burners - we're gonna go

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.500 
turning on the burners - we're gonna go
full<00:01:28.980> test<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.550> burners<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.240> first

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
full test with the burners the first

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.390 
full test with the burners the first
step<00:01:31.010> is<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.460> take<00:01:33.740> water<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:35.010> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
step is to take water that's going to be

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
step is to take water that's going to be
on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.920> co<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.900> add<00:01:39.900> it

want to chill the coil that's in the alt

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.350 
want to chill the coil that's in the alt
to<00:03:50.010> cool<00:03:50.250> doubts<00:03:50.520> at<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.850> point<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.270> would

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
to cool doubts at this point that would

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.010 
to cool doubts at this point that would
add<00:03:51.569> cold<00:03:51.840> water<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.550> leftmost<00:03:54.020> container

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
add cold water to the leftmost container

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:10.350 
add cold water to the leftmost container
of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.230> HMT<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.030> recirculate

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.680 

so<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.220> recirculating

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.330 

through<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.440> coil

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.260 

all<00:04:21.489> over<00:04:22.199> itself

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
all over itself

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:43.730 
all over itself
let's<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:25.050> this

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580 

at<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.860> point<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:46.150> word<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.230> channel

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
at this point the word in the channel

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.260 
at this point the word in the channel
will<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.190> children<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.700> right<00:04:48.850> temperature

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
will be children the right temperature

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.990 
will be children the right temperature
and<00:04:50.040> we<00:04:51.040> would<00:04:51.190> hook<00:04:51.340> up<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.640> fermenter

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
and we would hook up a fermenter

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.670 
and we would hook up a fermenter
directly<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.630> one<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> connections<00:04:53.350> and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
directly to one of the connections and

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.640 
directly to one of the connections and
use<00:04:54.070> one<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.340> pumps<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:55.600> pump<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.410> word

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
use one of pumps to pump the word

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.480 
use one of pumps to pump the word
directly<00:04:57.420> into<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.510> fermenter<00:04:59.490> so

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
directly into the fermenter so

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.160 
directly into the fermenter so
everything<00:05:01.270> looks<00:05:01.330> like<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.720> working

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
everything looks like it's working

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.190 
everything looks like it's working
correctly<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:03.010> all<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> lines<00:05:03.640> are

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
correctly and all the lines are

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.300 
correctly and all the lines are
connected<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.470> everything's<00:05:06.100> flowing

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
connected and everything's flowing

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.910 
connected and everything's flowing
correctly<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.420> should<00:05:07.630> be<00:05:07.660> good<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:07.960> go<00:05:08.110> for

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
correctly so we should be good to go for

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.660 
correctly so we should be good to go for
a<00:05:09.310> mini<00:05:09.940> batch<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.390> beer
