00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 for all experts are super super good 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940
 and now this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.000
 how to highlight eyes with makeup 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 but without using too many products 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 well I'm going to start with the face and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.790
 what I am doing now is applying 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 a law that I use this because it's what 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 that works best for me but if you do not 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.340
 you are very fan of this type of products 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.570
 you can change it by a normal base or 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.570
 just do not apply anything 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 and to ratify what I just put 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.829
 I'm going to use compact powders myself 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
 I apply with a brush well release appointment and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.680
 I put them only in the areas where I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.680
 it seems that it is necessary 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.649
 to give that touch of color to my 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.079
 cheeks I'm going to use that bronze the 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.180
 coffee attack I put it from the most part 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.250
 chubby from my cheekbone towards the temple 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.539
 bone diagonally and I assure myself 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 blur it super super good 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 and already to finish with my makeup 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.490
 eyes I will use a gloss 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.500
 supernatural as in a flesh tone and what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.050
 I'm going to put on my lips 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 happening to my eyes to take away that 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.580
 look tired I will use a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 corrector in my circles and not only 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 I'm going to put it on the bottom of the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 eye but also I 'll take it 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.730
 upwards as you can see there because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.830
 there is also understood to darken 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.900
 and I will not melt with my ring finger 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.910
 because although it's better for me to be 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.290
 fuse the concealer with my skin but I 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.290
 go well 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.790
 and to wake up to a look I'm going to 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.369
 use this shadow client with credit 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.869
 and I'm going to put it in the lacrimal and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 true that this does a lot 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.940
 difference 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 now so that my look is higher 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.050
 I really do not know how to explain it but there 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.680
 you can see I'm going to comb and eyebrows 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.680
 upwards 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 I want that I will also do is 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.920
 make up but mainly as the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.970
 arch is to say the highest part of my 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 daughters is in orbit 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.620
 and if you do not want to look like 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.990
 angry do not use much product where 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.990
 eyebrows part used and popular 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.440
 to further highlight my eyebrows I'm going to 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.240
 use a cream highlighter and I'll 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.240
 to put right just below these 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.430
 now to give depth to my eye 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.620
 you can use a matte brown color in the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.270
 basin that is where my eye sinks and what 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.160
 I'm going to take a little out 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.180
 I am using the same color as 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.180
 I put in virginia 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.489
 and to generate contrast I will use 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.469
 the same illuminator that I put under my 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.599
 eyebrows but this I will not put as the 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.650
 almond of my eye and with video I'm going to 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.650
 extend towards the edges 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.030
 what I'm doing now is delineate 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.740
 the outer third of my eye so that it 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.090
 see a little more tear and I 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.340
 I used coffee 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.769
 and now of course it 's a mask 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.950
 eyelashes I applied two layers on the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.360
 upper lashes and by the way to my 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.019
 tabs but if you want you could 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.019
 rebuke them 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.650
 and obviously he also applied mask 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.750
 lashes on the lower lashes this 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.750
 seriously there will be a point in life 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.790
 already to finish I will use 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.650
 eyeliner in my water line if you 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.540
 You want your eye look more redondito 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.700
 and larger use a light color and 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.340
 if you want it to look more elongated and 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.400
 portrait uses the dark color like me 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.650
 that for example that you use January and so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.269
 it would be the finished looks I hope les 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.269
 I really liked a little kiss bayle 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720
 all right
