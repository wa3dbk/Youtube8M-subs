00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
was kind of rubbing against it I might
be<00:02:55.430> imagining<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.000> anyway<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.690> guess<00:02:57.080> my<00:02:57.230> point

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
be imagining it anyway I guess my point

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.650 
be imagining it anyway I guess my point
is<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.709> I'm<00:02:58.130> proud<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.640> myself<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.450> I'm

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
is that I'm proud of myself that I'm

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.650 
is that I'm proud of myself that I'm
handling<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.440> maturely<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:02.000> obviously

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
handling it so maturely but obviously

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.090 
handling it so maturely but obviously
not<00:03:02.900> dammit<00:03:03.290> rly<00:03:04.510> because<00:03:05.510> i<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.620> spent

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100

sit down discuss everything kind of talk
which<00:04:07.910> would<00:04:08.120> probably<00:04:08.299> have<00:04:08.570> been

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
which would probably have been

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.789 
which would probably have been
my<00:04:10.400> inclination<00:04:11.290> even<00:04:12.290> though<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.409> don't<00:04:12.650> think

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
my inclination even though I don't think

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.970 
my inclination even though I don't think
it<00:04:12.890> was<00:04:12.980> gone<00:04:13.250> well<00:04:13.489> it's<00:04:13.879> just<00:04:14.150> like<00:04:14.980> some

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
it was gone well it's just like some

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.879 
it was gone well it's just like some
time<00:04:16.220> passed<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:19.100> whatever<00:04:19.280> reason<00:04:20.889> we

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
time passed and for whatever reason we

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.760 
time passed and for whatever reason we
just<00:04:22.100> started<00:04:22.430> emailing<00:04:22.759> and<00:04:23.380> then<00:04:24.380> joking
