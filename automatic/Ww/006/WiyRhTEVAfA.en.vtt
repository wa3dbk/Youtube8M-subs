00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.299
 Our goal today 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.130
 is to help you get to know your equipment better and give some suggestions 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 practices 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 about biosafety in your office, contact me whenever you need it. 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.560
 For this community we share this presentation in topics. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.860
 Distiller 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.290
 The use of properly purified water is important for the maintenance of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 instruments and the autoclave itself. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 You can use the distilled water for other purposes. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.540
 The tank has capacity to distill up to 3.8 liters. 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.310
 When the distillation process is finished, the equipment 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.600
 automatically. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.320
 Use of the autoclave 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.960
 Separate distilled water according to the size of your autoclave: 150 ml to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.030
 12 liters and 250 ml for 21 liters. 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 Put water into the autoclave chamber. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.350
 In block 54 the supply is automatic. Distribute the packages inside 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.390
 autoclave on the inner trays or on the accessory holder. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.680
 Do not overlap packages and always load paper up. 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.820
 To optimize the cycle of your autoclave, use the CristÃ³foli envelopes holder 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.960
 with 13 dividers 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.520
 Vitale 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.860
 For model 12 or 21 liters turn on and wait for the cycle, 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.920
 heating and sterilization. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 When depressurising, wait for the beep 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.260
 and open for drying. 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.330
 At the end of the cycle the green LED will flash. 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.520
 When the packages are cold, store them in the closet. 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 To use your Vitale Plus after it is switched on select the appropriate cycle for 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.469
 the articles you will use. 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.669
 If you have assorted materials that require different cycles, choose the option 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:24.169
 where the temperature is lower and the drying time is longer. 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.869
 Press the start key 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.409
 and the program is automatic. 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.669
 Drying will happen with the door closed. 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.269
 When it is finished, the end of cycle display will appear. 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.139
 Remove the packages when cold and store them in your own closet. 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:46.629
 To sterilize liquids use only the exclusive cycle. 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.799
 Storage of sterilized material 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.150
 Storage of sterilized material should be done in a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.059
 Formica or other suitable material that is clean 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.169
 away from moisture and heat. 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.649
 Organized to avoid over-handling. 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:10.289
 Infection control is a team job. CristÃ³foli is at your 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 side to ensure safety you need what your patient deserves.
