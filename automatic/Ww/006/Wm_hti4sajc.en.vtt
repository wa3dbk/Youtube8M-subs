00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.370
 that is not a coup we feel now ourselves in the property 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.359
 invested 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.749
 professional 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.789
 another person in the pro-version and NDR with professor 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.050
 what Marco version 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.609
 differ in the end by himself through the greetings and he 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.900
 provides 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 Also the late shift will be listed as many strips us the number 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.089
 You can find this approach here 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.030
 Implement the technique how the whole thing works 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.660
 So what each of the Zoom ships with the attacks and I do not care about any of those 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.429
 like Aldi South 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.080
 the holder which is attached to the Camaro 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.470
 a certain number of him 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.679
 Crackers are finally equipped 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.010
 which will be on the mobility of society and of course logically 

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:50.300
 do not deny 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.400
 You will find here 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.250
 attached to the birth or anywhere else to it later more deadline is 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.650
 first of all, customers the Enders 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.990
 b sees how it all works 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.560
 just take look 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.890
 there we take ourselves 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.500
 this form itself 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.250
 so can the covenant 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.680
 advertised for fun punched out 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.850
 then we can easily enter the the une 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.800
 from 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 focusing on this 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.530
 but still sponsors 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.300
 What do you think of Erdinger - almost do not wait for the ideas 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300
 v 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.900
 At least you know, there are cars 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 so high everything so easy from 7 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.990
 lie at the moment 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.850
 just record 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 in the case that deals here 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.149
 so 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.149
 have been so far 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.340
 Schulz that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 fixed 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.920
 that is supposed to be 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.010
 Make a noise that is easy to show 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.820
 as you can see 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 This is especially the dancing but partly also better with the mother 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.059
 to say that you do not have to dare 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.180
 easy right now 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.299
 many of them are 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 keep left over here 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.909
 in Deetz dead end fruit lie one way street but back 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.259
 Part also built a lot 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.259
 driven by which one says so beautifully 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.739
 Struck the delicious yet easy to make the look then 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.269
 supply and demand 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.349
 they lay 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.360
 to fortify and try they had just removed 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.939
 that and the theater others through Â«much work on that the Indian this 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.809
 Judgment is 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:56.659
 the same 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.789
 I hope that now well as well as the request from Istanbul is consolidated 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:04.609
 on the back of the user on the front depending on how you do it then 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.299
 once did and then easy 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.430
 the hunt 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.919
 the site 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
 attached to the opponent of the lens cap 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 not at the height of his injury break said 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.789
 we bet on business 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.789
 that will just be her resignation 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.109
 too high 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.709
 the water is warm 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.819
 he keeps writing 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.709
 if they have found the applications 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.009
 as well as the whole then from Todesfelde 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.989
 That can happen very fast 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.989
 this is a very nice works council 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.549
 what is and must be 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.739
 the last time before interest taxes EBIT i 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.739
 These include, for example, on 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.579
 that too is a decline but completely occurs on the water 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.359
 the physicist 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.049
 that looks apparently shining 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.059
 we were fantastic 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:17.799
 he demands of course 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.799
 by means of program physicist technical 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.469
 Ferrostaal have indeed made my guest 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.439
 Werder Bremen and can, for example, also directly 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.620
 well, so it was one of the standard method Mittelmosel 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.460
 The goals of this next festival are also just behind penalties 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.650
 because you can also just angry had been regular 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.460
 Nevertheless 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.819
 of course I still have 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.930
 as before is survived 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.990
 Spit Lengerich 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.979
 the game is so small with Seoul at the 550d 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:58.680
 example 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.170
 my traffic on the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.760
 could run on the longest but practically never thought me then 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 example 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.879
 so tall 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.259
 I have that here in the Italian twin town 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.839
 starting in October 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.839
 transfer what I do not like 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.439
 if I just title it in front of inflated group titles 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.479
 Papilio on it 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.330
 and into the light in sight of the tester I do not and should be so before or after 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.499
 Emasculation 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:39.530
 and that would demand Wiedensahl 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.669
 They rely on the outlines like a tripod 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.400
 Hiking groups title worked out so well 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.950
 Cards that instead of iPad 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.559
 that happened again 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.559
 and 12 yes that's the DSL 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.930
 he completes Capture 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.020
 how different such a thing 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.460
 Schwabach Rosbach 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.800
 can watch as the whole technically 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 and that also outside 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.029
 the two sessions can set goals 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.669
 right in the camera Brady Barr tripod 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:10.389
 Toro Rosso
