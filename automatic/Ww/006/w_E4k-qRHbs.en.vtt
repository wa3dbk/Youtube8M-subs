00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
bud was fixed we could have lines of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
bud was fixed we could have lines of
redstone<00:00:30.150> next<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.779> another<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.380> was

redstone next to one another it was
going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.920> amazing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
get a rough understanding of what was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760 
get a rough understanding of what was
going<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.570> course<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> did

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
going on of course the first thing I did

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
going on of course the first thing I did
to<00:00:43.890> create<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.250> effect<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> retexture

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to create this effect was to retexture

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
to create this effect was to retexture
some<00:00:46.050> things<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> texture<00:00:47.010> pack<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
some things in the texture pack so the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.979 
some things in the texture pack so the
first<00:00:47.610> thing<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> i<00:00:47.879> retexture<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
first thing that i retexture was the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
first thing that i retexture was the
activator<00:00:49.500> rails<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.340> got<00:00:50.579> those

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
activator rails that is how we got those

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
activator rails that is how we got those
straight<00:00:51.120> lines<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.110> bluestone<00:00:52.530> there

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
straight lines of the bluestone there

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
straight lines of the bluestone there
and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.280> these<00:00:53.460> regular<00:00:53.940> rails<00:00:54.149> give

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and then these regular rails give

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
and then these regular rails give
bluestone<00:00:55.230> dots<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.010> quite<00:00:56.250> simply

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
bluestone dots now that was quite simply

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
bluestone dots now that was quite simply
so<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.449> placing<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.109> at

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so that when I was placing it down at

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
so that when I was placing it down at
changing<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> red<00:00:59.100> stone<00:00:59.340> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> blue

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
changing the red stone into the blue

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
changing the red stone into the blue
stone<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:01.020> look<00:01:01.140> realistic

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
stone it would actually look realistic

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.740 
stone it would actually look realistic
so<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> alternate<00:01:02.879> texture<00:01:03.180> pack<00:01:03.390> they

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so in the alternate texture pack they

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
so in the alternate texture pack they
look<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
look a little bit like this so on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
look a little bit like this so on the
left<00:01:05.670> hand<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:06.060> well<00:01:06.240> used<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.720> regular

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
left hand side well used to be a regular

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.810 
left hand side well used to be a regular
rail<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> blue<00:01:08.100> stone<00:01:08.310> dot<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
rail is now a blue stone dot and on the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
rail is now a blue stone dot and on the
right<00:01:09.000> hand<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.740> blue

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
right hand side we have got this blue

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
right hand side we have got this blue
stone<00:01:11.250> line<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> cool<00:01:12.030> thing<00:01:12.060> about

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
stone line now the cool thing about

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
stone line now the cool thing about
using<00:01:12.450> activator<00:01:13.170> rails<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.950> course<00:01:14.159> they

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
using activator rails is of course they

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
using activator rails is of course they
could<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.610> turned<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.150> off<00:01:15.210> again<00:01:15.509> which

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
could be turned on and off again which

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
could be turned on and off again which
means<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> gone<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.799> texture

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
means they have gone on and off texture

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
means they have gone on and off texture
so<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> read<00:01:17.970> textures<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> those

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so I read textures both of those

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
so I read textures both of those
obviously<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:19.950> being<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> off

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
obviously one of them being the off

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
obviously one of them being the off
texture<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.900> being<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> on

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
texture and one of them at being the on

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
texture and one of them at being the on
texture<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.040> made<00:01:23.250> life<00:01:23.400> quite<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> bit

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
texture which made life quite a bit

easier<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.350> the

easier the way that I did the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
independent powering really was quite

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
independent powering really was quite
simple<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.409> side<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
simple obviously on this side with just

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
simple obviously on this side with just
the<00:01:29.250> redstone<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.270> didn't<00:01:30.600> need<00:01:30.780> any<00:01:30.990> fancy

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the redstone that didn't need any fancy

we<00:01:33.570> only<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:34.020> activator<00:01:34.619> rails<00:01:34.890> going

we only have activator rails going
across<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.119> wouldn't<00:01:36.479> actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
across here so they wouldn't actually

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420

power<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> redstone<00:01:37.650> lamp<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.009> instead<00:01:38.310> what

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
power that redstone lamp so instead what

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
power that redstone lamp so instead what
we've<00:01:38.579> done<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.180> flick<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> leaver<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
we've done we just flick this leaver and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.600 
we've done we just flick this leaver and
take<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.500> blocks<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.460> we've

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
take out these blocks you can see we've

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
take out these blocks you can see we've
got<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> line<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.090> redstone<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.750> goes<00:01:42.869> from

got a line of redstone that goes from

block that powers that redstone lamp
honestly<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.090> quite<00:01:48.270> an<00:01:48.390> obvious

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
honestly that one was quite an obvious

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
honestly that one was quite an obvious
one<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.530> fairly<00:01:49.829> surprised<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.549> no

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
one so I would be fairly surprised if no

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
one so I would be fairly surprised if no
one<00:01:51.090> caught<00:01:51.299> me<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.560> where

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
one caught me out there this is where

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.109 
one caught me out there this is where
things<00:01:53.009> begin<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:53.880> bit

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
things begin to get just a little bit

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.609

sneaky<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.930> last<00:01:55.140> year's<00:01:55.409> end<00:01:55.560> a

to create the effect of me doing

why<00:02:04.229> did<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.680> i<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:05.009> clicked<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.369> the

why did was i right clicked on the

why did was i right clicked on the
redstone<00:02:05.880> using<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> lapis<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.750> would<00:02:06.899> then

out<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> redstone

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
out the redstone

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.220 
out the redstone
place<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.180> some<00:02:12.390> blue<00:02:12.569> stone<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:13.170> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
place down some blue stone and then I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.490 
place down some blue stone and then I
would

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
would

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
same way and I would right click once

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.140 
same way and I would right click once
again<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> lapis<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.460> then<00:02:20.910> in

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
again with the lapis and then in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.790 
again with the lapis and then in
post-production<00:02:21.570> when<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.410> piecing<00:02:22.710> all

of it together

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.130

I<00:02:23.520> would<00:02:23.850> match<00:02:24.060> them<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> point<00:02:24.960> where

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I would match them up at the point where

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690 
I would match them up at the point where
the<00:02:25.230> lapis<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.710> at<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> lowest<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.610> then

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
the lapis was at the lowest I would then

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
the lapis was at the lowest I would then
swap<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> clips<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.230> would<00:02:28.350> give

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
swap the clips over and it would give

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.380 
swap the clips over and it would give
the<00:02:28.620> effect<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.190> me<00:02:29.310> replacing<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> red<00:02:30.090> stone

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the effect of me replacing the red stone

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
the effect of me replacing the red stone
with<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> bit<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.350> blue<00:02:31.709> stone<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.490> quite

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
with a bit of blue stone it's quite

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
with a bit of blue stone it's quite
simple<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:34.080> did<00:02:34.290> require<00:02:34.320> some<00:02:34.709> sleight

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
simple but it did require some sleight

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.830 
simple but it did require some sleight
of<00:02:35.220> hand<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:35.850> I'm<00:02:35.910> very<00:02:36.090> happy<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.540> how<00:02:36.690> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
of hand but I'm very happy with how it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.230 
of hand but I'm very happy with how it
turned<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:38.160> bud<00:02:38.340> Pistons<00:02:38.790> pretty<00:02:39.060> much

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
turned out the bud Pistons pretty much

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.150 
turned out the bud Pistons pretty much
used<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.690> same<00:02:39.870> technique<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.440> course<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.130> of

used the same technique of course all of

used the same technique of course all of
the<00:02:41.280> redstone<00:02:41.640> stuff<00:02:41.970> didn't<00:02:42.270> need<00:02:42.420> any<00:02:42.600> other

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the redstone stuff didn't need any other

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480 
the redstone stuff didn't need any other
fancy<00:02:42.990> bits<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.709> bud<00:02:43.860> Pistons<00:02:44.310> still

fancy bits because the bud Pistons still
exist<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.180> demonstrated<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.930> with

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
exist so I just demonstrated that with

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.780 
exist so I just demonstrated that with
the<00:02:46.500> blue<00:02:46.680> stone<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.130> course<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.520> we<00:02:47.610> place

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the blue stone of course when we place

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.670 
the blue stone of course when we place
the<00:02:47.970> first<00:02:48.209> sticky<00:02:48.510> piston<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.080> didn't

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the first sticky piston that didn't

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.020 
the first sticky piston that didn't
really<00:02:49.860> matter<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.280> these<00:02:50.580> activator

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
really matter because these activator

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.850 
really matter because these activator
rails<00:02:51.270> aren't<00:02:51.630> powering<00:02:51.930> anything<00:02:52.290> obviously

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
rails aren't powering anything obviously

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.020 
rails aren't powering anything obviously
that<00:02:53.010> piston<00:02:53.370> place<00:02:53.550> down<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> bottom

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
that piston place down on the bottom

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.120 
that piston place down on the bottom
wasn't<00:02:54.570> going<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> extend<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.920> this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
wasn't going to extend but at this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.070 
wasn't going to extend but at this
piston<00:02:56.580> here<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.030> placed<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.840> had<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
piston here when we placed it we had to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.720 
piston here when we placed it we had to
make<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.260> look<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.950> was<00:02:59.070> being<00:02:59.280> extended

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
make it look like it was being extended

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.090 
make it look like it was being extended
by<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.450> blue<00:03:00.750> stone<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.320> what<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.530> did<00:03:01.709> was<00:03:01.950> when

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
by the blue stone so what I did was when

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.610 
by the blue stone so what I did was when
I<00:03:02.160> placed<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.850> then<00:03:03.180> alt<00:03:03.450> tabbed<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.989> came

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
I placed it I then alt tabbed out came

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
I placed it I then alt tabbed out came
along<00:03:04.830> with<00:03:05.010> my<00:03:05.130> second<00:03:05.459> account<00:03:05.670> placed<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
along with my second account placed at a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.090 
along with my second account placed at a
redstone<00:03:06.540> block<00:03:06.660> behind<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.500> piston<00:03:07.950> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
redstone block behind that piston and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.130 
redstone block behind that piston and
then<00:03:08.580> once<00:03:08.820> again<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.300> post-production<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
then once again in post-production I

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.170 
then once again in post-production I
pieced<00:03:10.620> those<00:03:10.830> two<00:03:11.040> clips<00:03:11.250> together<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.910> it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
pieced those two clips together and it

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
pieced those two clips together and it
made<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.510> look<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> piston<00:03:13.290> extended<00:03:13.770> as

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
made it look like the piston extended as

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.800 
made it look like the piston extended as
we<00:03:14.130> placed<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.720> ladies

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
we placed it so there we have it ladies

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.600 
we placed it so there we have it ladies
