00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
resolution isn't very high I'd say

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.450 
resolution isn't very high I'd say
that's<00:02:04.049> probably<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.500> biggest<00:02:04.829> downside<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's probably the biggest downside of

that's probably the biggest downside of
this<00:02:05.549> display<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.719> start<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> see

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
at my photo I think that's awesome and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.240 
at my photo I think that's awesome and
it<00:03:25.109> really<00:03:25.260> should<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.530> feature<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:26.070> every

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it really should be a feature on every

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.349 
it really should be a feature on every
phone<00:03:26.549> if<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.760> ask<00:03:26.880> me

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
I will note that it does either way at

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.890 
I will note that it does either way at
the<00:03:29.160> battery<00:03:29.579> life<00:03:29.760> more<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.420> than<00:03:30.690> when<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the battery life more so than when the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.479 
the battery life more so than when the

lockscreen itself though has a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.160 
lockscreen itself though has a
lockscreen<00:03:36.239> widget<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.750> gives<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.019> access

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
a smart phone so I thought it was

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.780 
a smart phone so I thought it was
definitely<00:04:13.230> worth<00:04:13.380> sharing<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.040> also<00:04:14.489> want<00:04:14.760> to

mention that the blue vivo air does have

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.409 
mention that the blue vivo air does have

an octa-core processor built inside of

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
here that manages to perform pretty well

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.279 
here that manages to perform pretty well
and<00:04:20.400> keeps<00:04:20.909> things<00:04:21.150> pretty<00:04:21.330> smooth<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.200> the

and keeps things pretty smooth for the
most<00:04:22.500> part<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:23.280> does<00:04:23.490> feature<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.909> mediatek

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
most part it does feature a mediatek

sir that doesn't perform as well as a
Snapdragon<00:04:28.030> processor<00:04:28.539> so<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.110> will<00:04:29.380> notice

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
Snapdragon processor so you will notice

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.320 
Snapdragon processor so you will notice
some<00:04:29.830> stuttering<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.699> there<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.120> will

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
some stuttering here and there that will

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.270 
some stuttering here and there that will
not<00:04:31.509> be<00:04:31.660> very<00:04:31.930> aesthetically<00:04:32.620> pleasing

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
not be very aesthetically pleasing

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.339 
not be very aesthetically pleasing
I<00:04:33.430> mean<00:04:33.940> multi-tasking<00:04:34.599> does<00:04:34.840> work<00:04:35.110> well

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
I mean multi-tasking does work well

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.960 
I mean multi-tasking does work well
although<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.830> order<00:04:36.039> to<00:04:36.190> switch<00:04:36.370> between<00:04:36.550> apps

and<00:04:46.270> nothing<00:04:46.630> else<00:04:46.750> will<00:04:46.990> happen<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.710> have

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
and nothing else will happen so you have

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.469 
and nothing else will happen so you have
to<00:04:47.979> press<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.310> home<00:04:48.430> button<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.910> then<00:04:49.330> go

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
to press the home button and then go

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.240 
to press the home button and then go
over<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.020> hold<00:04:50.289> down<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.560> menu<00:04:50.770> button<00:04:51.039> from

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
over and hold down the menu button from

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.800 
over and hold down the menu button from
there<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:51.910> it's<00:04:52.060> kind<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.300> strange<00:04:52.599> and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
there so it's kind of strange and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.809 
there so it's kind of strange and
definitely<00:04:53.500> slows<00:04:53.770> down<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.160> multitasking

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
definitely slows down the multitasking

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.120 
definitely slows down the multitasking
process<00:04:55.360> now<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.110> camera<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.740> kind<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:57.069> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
process now the camera is kind of a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.830 
process now the camera is kind of a
disappointment<00:04:57.610> as<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.030> usually<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.419> with

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
disappointment as it usually is with

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.960 
disappointment as it usually is with
budget<00:04:59.229> smartphones<00:04:59.770> now<00:05:00.069> like<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.400> said<00:05:00.460> it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
budget smartphones now like I said it

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.670 
budget smartphones now like I said it
features<00:05:01.449> an<00:05:01.659> 8<00:05:01.810> megapixel<00:05:02.319> camera<00:05:02.349> sensor

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
features an 8 megapixel camera sensor

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.950 
features an 8 megapixel camera sensor
but<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.340> just<00:05:03.610> doesn't<00:05:03.940> capture<00:05:04.539> that<00:05:04.659> grid<00:05:04.870> of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
but it just doesn't capture that grid of

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.990 
but it just doesn't capture that grid of
images<00:05:05.319> it's<00:05:05.949> kind<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.159> a<00:05:06.250> disappointment<00:05:06.370> I

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
images it's kind of a disappointment I

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520 
images it's kind of a disappointment I
mean<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.360> can't<00:05:07.599> get<00:05:07.720> by<00:05:07.870> but<00:05:08.139> indoor

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
mean you can't get by but indoor

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.830 
mean you can't get by but indoor
pictures<00:05:08.919> are<00:05:09.159> pretty<00:05:09.430> grainy<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:10.090> not<00:05:10.569> very

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
pictures are pretty grainy and not very

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.870 
pictures are pretty grainy and not very
detailed<00:05:11.440> they<00:05:11.979> do<00:05:12.039> have<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.400> very<00:05:12.639> nice

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
detailed they do have a very nice

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.550 
detailed they do have a very nice
vintage<00:05:13.240> appearance<00:05:13.840> though<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:14.319> if<00:05:14.409> you're

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
vintage appearance though so if you're

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.740 
vintage appearance though so if you're
going<00:05:14.770> for<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.069> then<00:05:15.430> great<00:05:15.819> but<00:05:16.539> if<00:05:16.630> you're

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
going for that then great but if you're

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.930 
going for that then great but if you're
looking<00:05:16.960> for<00:05:17.139> crisp<00:05:17.500> detailed<00:05:18.190> images<00:05:18.639> then

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
looking for crisp detailed images then

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.309 
looking for crisp detailed images then
this<00:05:19.210> really<00:05:19.539> isn't<00:05:19.690> going<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.110> be<00:05:20.199> the

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
this really isn't going to be the

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.290 
this really isn't going to be the
smartphone<00:05:20.770> for<00:05:20.949> you<00:05:21.159> although<00:05:21.849> outdoor

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
smartphone for you although outdoor

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.029 
smartphone for you although outdoor
images<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:22.870> good<00:05:23.169> lighting<00:05:23.409> will<00:05:23.770> look

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
images and good lighting will look

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.010 
images and good lighting will look
better<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:25.090> you'd<00:05:25.240> think<00:05:25.360> for<00:05:25.479> such<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> thin

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
better so you'd think for such a thin

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.390 
better so you'd think for such a thin
device<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.590> battery<00:05:26.889> life<00:05:27.069> would<00:05:27.280> be

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
device the battery life would be

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.820 
device the battery life would be
absolutely<00:05:27.940> garbage<00:05:28.449> but<00:05:28.750> blue<00:05:28.960> manages<00:05:29.440> to

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
absolutely garbage but blue manages to

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.430 
absolutely garbage but blue manages to
pack<00:05:30.070> a<00:05:30.280> 2100<00:05:31.060> milliamp<00:05:31.389> battery<00:05:31.479> inside<00:05:32.259> of

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
pack a 2100 milliamp battery inside of

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.290 
pack a 2100 milliamp battery inside of
here<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.860> it's<00:05:33.370> certainly<00:05:33.550> not<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:34.000> biggest

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
here and it's certainly not the biggest

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.540 
here and it's certainly not the biggest
battery<00:05:34.599> but<00:05:34.810> it's<00:05:34.990> honestly<00:05:35.349> not<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.650> bad<00:05:36.219> I

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
battery but it's honestly not that bad I

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.950 
battery but it's honestly not that bad I
mean<00:05:36.580> stay<00:05:36.909> at<00:05:36.969> my<00:05:37.060> time<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.419> pretty<00:05:37.630> good<00:05:37.780> I

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
mean stay at my time is pretty good I

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.810 
mean stay at my time is pretty good I
can<00:05:38.139> leave<00:05:38.259> this<00:05:38.380> phone<00:05:38.620> on<00:05:38.830> overnight<00:05:39.250> and

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
can leave this phone on overnight and

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.040 
can leave this phone on overnight and
the<00:05:39.940> battery<00:05:40.270> life<00:05:40.419> won't<00:05:40.719> drop

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
the battery life won't drop

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.170 
the battery life won't drop
significantly<00:05:41.860> when<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:42.430> have<00:05:42.639> a<00:05:42.669> lot<00:05:42.880> of<00:05:42.909> smart

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
significantly when I have a lot of smart

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.240 
significantly when I have a lot of smart
gestures<00:05:43.599> turned<00:05:43.900> on<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.409> battery<00:05:44.800> life<00:05:44.949> does

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
gestures turned on the battery life does

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.730 
gestures turned on the battery life does
drop<00:05:45.550> more<00:05:45.789> and<00:05:46.060> there<00:05:46.719> is<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.840> CPU<00:05:47.380> power

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
drop more and there is a CPU power

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.770 
drop more and there is a CPU power
saving<00:05:47.949> mode<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.729> limits<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.180> CPU

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
saving mode that limits the CPU

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.839 
saving mode that limits the CPU
performance<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.650> conserve<00:05:51.009> battery<00:05:51.250> life<00:05:51.460> and

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
performance to conserve battery life and

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.149 
performance to conserve battery life and
so<00:05:52.419> I<00:05:52.449> was<00:05:52.659> able<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.900> get<00:05:53.080> more<00:05:53.349> than<00:05:53.530> 5<00:05:53.800> hours

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
so I was able to get more than 5 hours

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.649 
so I was able to get more than 5 hours
of<00:05:54.310> use<00:05:54.490> with<00:05:54.699> this<00:05:54.849> phone<00:05:55.120> which<00:05:55.360> really

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
of use with this phone which really

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.570 
of use with this phone which really
isn't<00:05:55.810> too<00:05:56.080> terrible<00:05:56.530> at<00:05:56.650> all<00:05:56.830> now<00:05:57.550> I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
isn't too terrible at all now I

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.309 
isn't too terrible at all now I

mentioned earlier the blue vivo air can
be<00:05:59.409> summed<00:05:59.680> up<00:05:59.860> in<00:06:00.069> three<00:06:00.099> words<00:06:00.699> thin<00:06:01.539> premium
