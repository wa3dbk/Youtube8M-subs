00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay boys and girls and we all know that

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.640 
okay boys and girls and we all know that
Metro<00:00:02.730> 2033<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.780> probably<00:00:04.170> one<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.500> most

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
Metro 2033 is probably one of the most

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.099 
Metro 2033 is probably one of the most
extreme<00:00:05.160> games<00:00:06.120> out<00:00:06.359> there<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.779> really

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
extreme games out there and it really

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.860 
extreme games out there and it really
does<00:00:07.350> stress<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> graphics<00:00:08.580> card<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.719> well

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
does stress a graphics card and as well

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.419 
does stress a graphics card and as well
as<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> whole<00:00:10.230> sort<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.710> overall<00:00:11.010> system

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
as a whole sort of overall system

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.999 
as a whole sort of overall system
process<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.120> memory<00:00:12.389> included<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.469> what

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
process and memory included so what

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
process and memory included so what
we've<00:00:14.160> had<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.880> obviously<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.450> are

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
we've had to do because obviously we are

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
we've had to do because obviously we are
running<00:00:15.750> six<00:00:16.320> screens<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.920> had<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> turn

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
running six screens we've had to turn

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
running six screens we've had to turn
the<00:00:17.550> settings<00:00:17.880> down<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.750> don't<00:00:19.350> know<00:00:19.410> if<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the settings down so I don't know if you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.870 
the settings down so I don't know if you
can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.160> video<00:00:20.460> because<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
can see this on the video because of the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
can see this on the video because of the
lighting<00:00:21.119> by<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.930> actually<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.619> 50<00:00:23.279> 40<00:00:23.609> by<00:00:23.820> 20

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
lighting by are actually at 50 40 by 20

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
lighting by are actually at 50 40 by 20
100<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> resolution<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.680> perfect

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
100 on the resolution which is perfect

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580 
100 on the resolution which is perfect
is<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.699> move<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.869> quality<00:00:28.260> we've<00:00:28.439> had

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
is that we move on the quality we've had

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
is that we move on the quality we've had
to<00:00:28.710> drop<00:00:28.859> down<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> medium<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.990> anti-aliasing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to drop down to medium and anti-aliasing

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.970 
to drop down to medium and anti-aliasing
we've<00:00:31.170> had<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.590> from<00:00:31.800> MS<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> 4<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> AAA

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
we've had to take from MS a a 4 to AAA

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
we've had to take from MS a a 4 to AAA
texture<00:00:34.980> fill<00:00:35.160> room<00:00:35.340> we've<00:00:35.460> still<00:00:35.640> AF<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.210> 16

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
texture fill room we've still AF on 16

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.959 
texture fill room we've still AF on 16
and<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.559> no<00:00:37.680> problem<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.010> tessellations<00:00:38.790> on

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and so no problem there tessellations on

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.660 
and so no problem there tessellations on
DirectX<00:00:39.480> 11<00:00:39.840> no<00:00:40.079> problem<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.520> did

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
DirectX 11 no problem at all if you did

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.979 
DirectX 11 no problem at all if you did
want<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> bump<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.210> settings<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> little

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
want to bump these settings up a little

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
want to bump these settings up a little
bit<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.559> find<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.040> you'd<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
bit you would find that you'd have this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
bit you would find that you'd have this
will<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:45.000> over<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:46.640> possibly<00:00:47.640> having<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.120> 69

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
will go over to possibly having to 69

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
will go over to possibly having to 69
50s<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.710> obviously<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> car<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
50s if this was obviously the car that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
50s if this was obviously the car that
you<00:00:50.879> were<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:52.199> 69<00:00:52.710> 50s<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you were going to look at to 69 50s in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
you were going to look at to 69 50s in
crossfire<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.780> click<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> run

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
crossfire but if we just click on run

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
crossfire but if we just click on run
benchmark<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.539> exactly<00:00:58.020> how

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
benchmark and we can see exactly how

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
benchmark and we can see exactly how
Metro<00:00:59.070> 2033<00:00:59.250> is<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> perform<00:01:00.539> under

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
Metro 2033 is going to perform under

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.740 
Metro 2033 is going to perform under
those<00:01:01.079> conditions<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.730> we've<00:01:03.239> been<00:01:03.449> tweaking

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
those conditions now we've been tweaking

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
those conditions now we've been tweaking
about<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.290> sort<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> try<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.890> find<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> best

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
about to sort of try and find the best

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.750 
about to sort of try and find the best
conditions<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
conditions for you know for this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
conditions for you know for this
graphics<00:01:09.180> card<00:01:09.240> obviously<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> 69

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
graphics card obviously if we have a 69

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.800 
graphics card obviously if we have a 69
19<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> had<00:01:11.700> sort<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.479> 6

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
19 that had sort of you know 6

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.210 
19 that had sort of you know 6
connections<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:13.680> problem<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.100> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
connections on it no problem at all we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.530 
connections on it no problem at all we
could<00:01:14.310> bump<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> settings<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> little<00:01:15.390> bit

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
could bump up the settings a little bit

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
could bump up the settings a little bit
but<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.380> only<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.619> 69<00:01:17.070> 50<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.060> we

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
but because it's only a 69 50 and we

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.580 
but because it's only a 69 50 and we
sort<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> tweaked<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> got

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
sort of tweaked it so we have got

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
sort of tweaked it so we have got
settings<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> will<00:01:20.280> give<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.640> reasonable

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
settings that will give you a reasonable

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
settings that will give you a reasonable
sort<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> playable<00:01:22.130> framerate<00:01:23.130> though<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
sort of playable framerate though you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
sort of playable framerate though you
may<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> tweak<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:24.900> bit

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
may even want to tweak it a little bit

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.249 
may even want to tweak it a little bit
yourself<00:01:25.580> because<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> top<00:01:27.780> left<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
yourself because up in the top left you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.530 
yourself because up in the top left you
can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.100> frame<00:01:30.090> rate<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> we're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
can see the frame rate that we're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.649 
can see the frame rate that we're
getting<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.579> obviously<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:32.880> people<00:01:33.030> really

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
getting and obviously some people really

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
getting and obviously some people really
do<00:01:33.780> care<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:34.049> having<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> sort<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> extra

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
do care about having that sort of extra

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.039 
do care about having that sort of extra
higher<00:01:35.909> frame<00:01:36.299> rate<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.020> really

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
higher frame rate so it all really

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
higher frame rate so it all really
depends<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.920> own<00:01:38.040> personal<00:01:38.460> preference

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
depends on your own personal preference

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.929 
depends on your own personal preference
and<00:01:39.320> obviously<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.250> higher<00:01:41.670> frame

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and obviously if you want a higher frame

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.340 
and obviously if you want a higher frame
rate<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.540> we've<00:01:42.720> actually<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
rate than what we've actually got here

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
rate than what we've actually got here
today<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.399> work<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.790> exactly

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
today but we're gonna work out exactly

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.370 
today but we're gonna work out exactly
what<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> average<00:01:45.540> frame<00:01:45.899> rate<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
what the average frame rate is in a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.870 
what the average frame rate is in a
minute<00:01:46.590> after<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.950> benchmark<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.549> finished

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
minute after this benchmark is finished

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
minute after this benchmark is finished
and<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.720> sort<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> see

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and you can sort of have a look and see

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
and you can sort of have a look and see
well<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
well see you know if you think it's a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
well see you know if you think it's a
playable<00:01:52.290> frame<00:01:52.649> rate<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:52.890> yourselves<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
playable frame rate for yourselves and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.870 
playable frame rate for yourselves and
they're<00:01:53.790> obviously<00:01:54.390> comment<00:01:54.840> below<00:01:54.960> into

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
they're obviously comment below into

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
they're obviously comment below into
exactly<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
exactly what you think if you think this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
exactly what you think if you think this
is<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.070> playable<00:01:59.460> frame<00:01:59.700> rate<00:01:59.880> for

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
is you know playable frame rate for

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.209 
is you know playable frame rate for
yourself<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:01.950> sort<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
yourself or you know what sort of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.999 
yourself or you know what sort of
settings<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.409> prime<00:02:04.710> frame

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
settings you use to get that prime frame

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.870 
settings you use to get that prime frame
rate<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.490> after

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
rate that you're after

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.839 
rate that you're after
so<00:02:06.659> benchmarks<00:02:07.259> finished<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:08.099> i<00:02:08.280> zoom<00:02:08.310> in

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
so benchmarks finished and if i zoom in

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
so benchmarks finished and if i zoom in
a<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:09.209> bit<00:02:09.420> hopefully<00:02:10.140> you'll<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.289> able<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
a little bit hopefully you'll be able to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.010 
a little bit hopefully you'll be able to
see<00:02:10.800> this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.970 

okay<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.400> frame<00:02:15.090> rate<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:15.990> just<00:02:16.830> over

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
okay so frame rate we can see just over

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.490 
okay so frame rate we can see just over
here<00:02:17.340> tells<00:02:17.970> us<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.390> average<00:02:18.600> frame<00:02:19.020> rate<00:02:19.230> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
here tells us the average frame rate is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.760 
here tells us the average frame rate is
thirty<00:02:20.130> point<00:02:20.760> seven<00:02:21.120> two<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
thirty point seven two so I do know that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
thirty point seven two so I do know that
obviously<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> majority<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.940> people<00:02:24.180> are

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
obviously the majority of people are

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.380 
obviously the majority of people are
happy<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> frame<00:02:25.230> rate<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.470> over<00:02:25.980> 30

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
happy with a frame rate of over 30

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
happy with a frame rate of over 30
frames<00:02:27.390> per<00:02:27.480> second<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.340> thirty

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
frames per second so you know thirty

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.340 
frames per second so you know thirty
point<00:02:30.000> seven<00:02:30.330> two<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.630> bang<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> money

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
point seven two is bang on the money

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.960 
point seven two is bang on the money
really<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.160> actually<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.700> pleased

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
really so we was actually really pleased

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.200 
really so we was actually really pleased
with<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> results<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:33.960> there
