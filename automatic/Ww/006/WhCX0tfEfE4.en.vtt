00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
it all works running into a little bit

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.220 
it all works running into a little bit
of<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> muffler<00:00:20.400> clearance<00:00:21.180> issue<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.140> I'm

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
of a muffler clearance issue so I'm

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
of a muffler clearance issue so I'm
going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> extend<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.800> muffler<00:00:23.900> up<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.050> little

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
going to extend my muffler up a little

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
going to extend my muffler up a little
bit<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:29.960> he<00:00:30.960> came<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bit and go from there but he came out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
bit and go from there but he came out
okay<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:33.230> weld<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.800> bracket<00:00:35.280> aren't<00:00:35.640> my

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
okay the weld on my bracket aren't my

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.160 
okay the weld on my bracket aren't my
best<00:00:36.390> well<00:00:36.630> by<00:00:37.500> far<00:00:38.120> but<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.750> kind<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> hard

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
best well by far but it's kind of hard

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.360 
best well by far but it's kind of hard
to<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> big<00:00:41.579> torch<00:00:41.940> head<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:43.370> just

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
to get the big torch head in there just

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
to get the big torch head in there just
because<00:00:44.520> there's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> limited<00:00:45.450> space

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
because there's a lot of limited space

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
because there's a lot of limited space
it'd<00:00:45.989> probably<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.410> easier<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:48.079> with<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it'd probably be easier with a with a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
it'd probably be easier with a with a
stick<00:00:49.440> welder<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:51.300> again

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
stick welder to do this just again

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
stick welder to do this just again
because<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.050> no<00:00:52.230> room<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.710> could

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
because there's no room I could

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
because there's no room I could
disassemble<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.510> unit<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> could

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
disassemble the unit and I could

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.189 
disassemble the unit and I could
probably<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.590> better<00:00:55.949> welds<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:57.199> honestly

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
probably get better welds but honestly

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
probably get better welds but honestly
you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.039> long<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.399> hold<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.730> don't

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you know as long as they hold I don't

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700 
you know as long as they hold I don't
really<00:00:59.969> care<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.510> look<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.170> they

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
really care what they look like and they

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
really care what they look like and they
are<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.730> penetration<00:01:06.170> but

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
are they did get good penetration but

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.950 
are they did get good penetration but
yeah<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.770> don't<00:01:07.920> still<00:01:08.610> look<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.090> great<00:01:11.960> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
yeah they don't still look so great so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.950 
yeah they don't still look so great so
you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.180> do<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you know what can you do I got this in

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.030 
you know what can you do I got this in
primary<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> throw<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> coat<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
primary I'm going to throw a coat of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.380 
primary I'm going to throw a coat of
paint<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.759> figure<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.270> well

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
paint on it I figure I might as well

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030 
paint on it I figure I might as well
because<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> never<00:01:18.869> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.710> engine

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
because I never want to take this engine

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219 
because I never want to take this engine
off<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:21.360> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.689> pain<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.930> line

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
off again it's kind of a pain to line

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.100 
off again it's kind of a pain to line
everything<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:23.330> just<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
everything up just because the way of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
everything up just because the way of
these<00:01:25.259> blowers<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.770> designed<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:27.330> can't<00:01:28.610> see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
these blowers are designed you can't see

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.039 
these blowers are designed you can't see
if<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.299> away<00:01:31.579> well<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.700> you

you<00:01:34.049> guys<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:35.329> but<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> fan

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you guys can see in there but the fan

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
you guys can see in there but the fan
blades<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.560> since<00:01:38.040> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
blades are in there now and since this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.300 
blades are in there now and since this
opening<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.939> smaller<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.110> can't<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.740> slide

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
opening is smaller you can't just slide

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
opening is smaller you can't just slide
the<00:01:41.490> fan<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> there

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the fan on you have to put it in there

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
the fan on you have to put it in there
then<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> line<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> motor<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.890> with

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
then you have to line the motor up with

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.850 
then you have to line the motor up with
the<00:01:44.700> keyway<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.240> tighten<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.259> fan<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.680> as

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the keyway then tighten the fan on as

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
the keyway then tighten the fan on as
you<00:01:47.009> pull<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> motor<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.210> see

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you pull the motor in and then see

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
you pull the motor in and then see

tight in the honda motor 38 and i use
fine<00:02:08.849> thread<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.810> hold<00:02:10.140> tighter

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
fine thread because they hold tighter

don't come all the way out of the
brackets<00:02:27.099> before<00:02:27.430> hitting<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> bottom<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:29.230> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
brackets before hitting the bottom not a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
fits right on there now to make the key

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.870 
fits right on there now to make the key
work<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:02.230> need<00:03:02.319> one<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.590> these<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.849> a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
work you need one of these this is a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.140 
work you need one of these this is a
step<00:03:04.269> key<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.709> smaller<00:03:06.130> portion<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:08.910> 316<00:03:09.910> and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
step key the smaller portion is 316 and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420 
step key the smaller portion is 316 and
the<00:03:11.049> bigger<00:03:11.230> part<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.620> key<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.069> quarter

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the bigger part of the key is quarter

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.900 
the bigger part of the key is quarter
inch<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> special<00:03:15.010> grind<00:03:15.430> key<00:03:15.790> if

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
inch and this is a special grind key if

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.699 
inch and this is a special grind key if
you<00:03:15.940> look<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:17.170> can<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
you look you can see that the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.920 
you look you can see that the
three-quarter<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.730> mean<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.269> quarter<00:03:19.780> inch

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
three-quarter I mean the quarter inch

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.530 
three-quarter I mean the quarter inch
part<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.350> lot<00:03:20.590> bigger<00:03:20.890> than<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.549> 316<00:03:22.209> s<00:03:22.299> part

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
part is a lot bigger than the 316 s part

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.110 
part is a lot bigger than the 316 s part
and<00:03:22.720> that's<00:03:23.230> also<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:23.650> proportional<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.030> you

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
and that's also it's proportional so you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.440 
and that's also it's proportional so you
can<00:03:25.450> get<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> correct<00:03:26.680> step<00:03:27.070> out<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
can get the correct step out of that so

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.580 
can get the correct step out of that so
you<00:03:28.540> need<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.840> special<00:03:29.230> key<00:03:29.380> if<00:03:29.470> you're

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
you need this special key if you're

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.990 
you need this special key if you're
going<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.769> do<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.040> I'm<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.880> code

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
going to do this I'm going to code

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.569 
going to do this I'm going to code
everything<00:03:31.420> in<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.569> heavy<00:03:31.810> coating<00:03:32.260> of

everything in a heavy coating of
anti-seize<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.810> use<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.049> copper

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
anti-seize I like to use the copper

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.130 
anti-seize I like to use the copper
anti-seize<00:03:36.269> because<00:03:37.269> if<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.569> do<00:03:37.630> ever<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:38.049> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
anti-seize because if I do ever have to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.420 
anti-seize because if I do ever have to
take<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.410> apart<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.859> don't<00:03:39.040> want<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.280> be

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
take this apart I don't want it to be

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.979 
take this apart I don't want it to be
hard<00:03:39.609> to<00:03:39.760> take<00:03:40.390> apart<00:03:41.489> what<00:03:42.489> else<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:43.540> muffler

together<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.280> as<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.759> drain<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.060> you'll<00:05:05.419> get

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
together and as you drain it you'll get

a<00:07:13.120> good<00:07:13.360> motor<00:07:13.600> so<00:07:13.990> that<00:07:14.020> should<00:07:14.620> be<00:07:14.650> good<00:07:14.889> I'm

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
a good motor so that should be good I'm

with the EPA emissions regulations or

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.629 
with the EPA emissions regulations or
something<00:07:23.590> like<00:07:23.680> that<00:07:23.740> for<00:07:23.979> small<00:07:24.250> engines

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
something like that for small engines

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.300 
something like that for small engines
this<00:07:25.300> is<00:07:25.540> a<00:07:25.570> brand-new<00:07:26.290> motor<00:07:26.530> this<00:07:26.860> is<00:07:27.010> an<00:07:27.130> old

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
this is a brand-new motor this is an old

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.610 
this is a brand-new motor this is an old
motor<00:07:27.639> so<00:07:27.940> it<00:07:28.030> doesn't<00:07:28.300> have<00:07:28.479> that<00:07:31.470> but<00:07:32.470> yeah

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
motor so it doesn't have that but yeah

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.210 
motor so it doesn't have that but yeah
that's<00:07:33.070> pretty<00:07:33.820> much<00:07:33.940> it<00:07:35.640> so<00:07:38.130> hopefully<00:07:39.130> have

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
that's pretty much it so hopefully have

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.440 
that's pretty much it so hopefully have
a<00:07:39.280> video<00:07:39.550> of<00:07:39.669> this<00:07:39.729> running<00:07:40.120> tomorrow<00:07:40.450> say<00:07:41.380> it
