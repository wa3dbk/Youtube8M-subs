after visibility though could be a

after visibility though could be a
little<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> challenge<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.150> because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
little bit of a challenge just because

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.179 
little bit of a challenge just because
the<00:01:30.869> brightness<00:01:31.380> output<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> viewing

the brightness output and the viewing
angles<00:01:32.460> aren't<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> best<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> we're<00:01:33.630> still

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
angles aren't the best so we're still

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.179 
angles aren't the best so we're still
finding<00:01:34.079> ourselves<00:01:34.229> shielding<00:01:34.829> away<00:01:35.009> from

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
finding ourselves shielding away from

the<00:01:35.280> Sun<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.390> its<00:01:36.689> color<00:01:36.990> tones

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the Sun on top of that its color tones

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
the Sun on top of that its color tones
aren't<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.799> iridescent<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.579> we'd<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
aren't as iridescent as we'd like so it
