we'll<00:00:09.610> be<00:00:09.700> talking<00:00:09.879> about<00:00:10.440> encoding<00:00:11.440> so<00:00:12.249> what

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
we'll be talking about encoding so what

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.970 
we'll be talking about encoding so what
is<00:00:12.610> encoding<00:00:13.200> encoding<00:00:14.200> is<00:00:14.320> basically<00:00:14.769> the

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
is encoding encoding is basically the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.130 
is encoding encoding is basically the
process<00:00:15.459> of<00:00:15.579> converting<00:00:15.910> data<00:00:16.240> from<00:00:16.630> one<00:00:16.840> form

to<00:00:17.200> another<00:00:17.350> there<00:00:18.250> are<00:00:18.279> several<00:00:18.640> types<00:00:18.939> of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
to another there are several types of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.779 
to another there are several types of
encoding<00:00:19.630> including<00:00:20.109> audio<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:20.650> video<00:00:20.890> image

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
encoding including audio and video image

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.480 
encoding including audio and video image
and<00:00:22.060> character<00:00:22.720> encoding<00:00:23.009> will<00:00:24.009> stick<00:00:24.339> to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
and character encoding will stick to

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.779 
and character encoding will stick to
audio<00:00:24.789> and<00:00:24.849> video<00:00:25.210> in<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.509> CATV<00:00:26.019> environment

when encoding the data is often

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.640 
when encoding the data is often
compressed<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:30.609> save<00:00:30.820> bandwidth<00:00:31.359> as<00:00:31.650> encoding

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650

techniques<00:00:33.070> have<00:00:33.280> evolved<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.239> data<00:00:34.570> and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
techniques have evolved the data and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.810 
techniques have evolved the data and
bandwidth<00:00:35.289> have<00:00:35.440> reduced<00:00:35.860> so<00:00:36.190> more<00:00:36.430> channels

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
bandwidth have reduced so more channels

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.840
