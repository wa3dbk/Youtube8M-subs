 the ecology better 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.329
 for this the payments 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.369
 what he urged chip soc 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.179
 2010 of the charges that no longer works 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.550
 a militant 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.650
 been also 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.519
 yes 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.140
 we use your words 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.519
 shock absorber 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.259
 or suspension 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.259
 and this is where we do things as things 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 the portuguese martins 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.170
 the formation 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.530
 to convert the work that you want can be one of the neighbors 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.230
 He mentioned that the model that catches us china daily 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 impositions 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.740
 molotov we know 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.150
 However 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.020
 already being next 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.240
 is the most important thing in total quality 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.720
 and the quality 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.480
 per cent not to be named 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 for the moment 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.900
 is following 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.780
 the bbc 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.440
 the madness in doing it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 through the temple part 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.660
 the short story of the techint group that according to witnesses cited by the web both 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.010
 selected these are not guaranteed with bs as 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.130
 now 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.510
 percent 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.360
 the temple 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 as a church they consist late in the enclosure 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.240
 now these golden parts 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 this is another 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 the material this is another metal this metal is known as bronze 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.990
 what we recycle to make the function of these parts 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.860
 are your materials that supposedly no longer serve what they were made for 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460
 temple that are used 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.500
 the valves we use the key from to emerge sambulÃ¡ keys from the doors 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 click many that are used for water pumps 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 everything that is bronze that no longer serve 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.739
 we recycle that 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.669
 crimes 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.549
 for do 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.819
 these foundries 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.689
 now they will always doctorate him silver 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.349
 What we recycle are the pistons 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.009
 the day 23 hundred thousand machines of the cases known as century 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.849
 some money 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.289
 piety like that 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.209
 and to the public since it was 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.119
 regarding the bite 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.809
 that this metal 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.859
 and we also work on the silver the new course that you like from others 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.719
 documentary materials 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.200
 now to complement feel we use them other materials for example 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.149
 wood 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.930
 this wood in a practical way his name granadillo 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.220
 this way and resistant to over work on fire 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.709
 even better 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.169
 of the coast 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.029
 even by the north of the country they changed the name we read iron hand 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.979
 for its hardness 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.729
 but if you do not want this part to be enforced, we can change it 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.889
 other material 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.479
 What can be 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.999
 horn 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.649
 of the bull 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.159
 The bull's horns are divided into two parts in case of fall 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.649
 the albiverdes organization aims 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.779
 well we heat it 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.039
 and where are we to make this kind of hard cores or some other like the 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.559
 Minister of the Interior 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:41.459
 I tell it also cut it into segments we heat it pressed style 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.569
 and we take some plates of 40 pieces of souvenir plate to make some 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.869
 houses can be up to weapons 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:50.989
 as well 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 make the handles 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.859
 the machetes 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.969
 churchill or fabrics is farce that well 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.579
 for example to follow then a laminated plasterboard 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.639
 and another silver plate 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.249
 abu we wanted to rivet years 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:12.159
 and with tears like these we make him a head because he will close 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.969
 horse of some other figure that ask us 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.969
 if they want us to be in fact the name 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.900
 we use the bbk horns 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.849
 So you have to see the general norm 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.189
 For those 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:32.900
 of 5 6 7 points then those horns sometimes we cut them here like this 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.430
 and we put it on 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.909
 little by little they ask us for a unique piece of revealed horn collection 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.740
 even the horn madness johnny damon more sterile tired 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.670
 so that it does not get bitten because we know it's going to be a piece already 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.670
 of a collection of a piece that will last longer 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.690
 then we can make the whole body recompose the hacker prontito 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.040
 He also published that we already have a criminal notebook as part of the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.870
 handle 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.610
 if they want us to notice their hands 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.169
 we use 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.080
 as well 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.199
 the legs are nothing 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.550
 there are bigger dads more bags 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.509
 smaller sea larger 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.509
 this plan we are looking adequately for the size 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.169
 we cut it properly size 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.159
 we could 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.449
 the castillito taking care that he does not mistreat dangerous 4 towards that success 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.059
