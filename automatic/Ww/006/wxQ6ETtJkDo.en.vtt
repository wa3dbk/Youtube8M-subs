00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
okay this is my GV um brushless cage um

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.839 
okay this is my GV um brushless cage um
yeah<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.679> stock<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> moment<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.519> got<00:00:11.730> it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.500 
yesterday but this is it I'll show you
some<00:00:14.969> runs<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:15.990> camera<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.560> board<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
some runs with the camera on board and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.529 
some runs with the camera on board and
on<00:00:18.510> yes<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> cage<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.820> running<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
on yes so this is the cage I'm running a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.880 
on yes so this is the cage I'm running a
four<00:00:21.810> cell<00:00:24.560> 5000mah

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
four cell 5000mah

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.919 
four cell 5000mah
fourteen<00:00:27.080> something<00:00:28.080> volt<00:00:28.289> 30<00:00:29.010> current

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
fourteen something volt 30 current

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.770 
fourteen something volt 30 current
that's<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> battery<00:00:31.260> flaws<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.550> it

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
that's the battery flaws of that in it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
that's the battery flaws of that in it
on<00:00:33.920> yeah<00:00:34.920> he's<00:00:35.100> probably<00:00:35.250> wondering<00:00:35.610> why<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
on yeah he's probably wondering why I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.600 
on yeah he's probably wondering why I
have<00:00:36.590> these<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.010> cuz<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:38.370> where<00:00:38.489> I'm

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
have these on there cuz that's where I'm

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.660 
have these on there cuz that's where I'm
mounting<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:39.300> camera<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> front<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.670> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
mounting my camera on the front bit so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360 
mounting my camera on the front bit so
yeah<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.210> nice<00:00:42.360> buggy<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.620> eighths<00:00:43.770> go

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
yeah it's nice buggy it's one eighths go

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.729 
yeah it's nice buggy it's one eighths go
I<00:00:44.780> like<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> tires<00:00:46.670> they're<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.710> sort<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I like the tires they're like a sort of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.290 
I like the tires they're like a sort of
a<00:00:49.829> car<00:00:50.100> tire<00:00:50.719> arm<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.899> brushless<00:00:52.579> I'm<00:00:53.579> not

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a car tire arm it's brushless I'm not

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.510 
a car tire arm it's brushless I'm not
quite<00:00:54.570> sure<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:55.260> size<00:00:55.500> motor<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.190> it's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
quite sure what size motor but it's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.479 
quite sure what size motor but it's
bigger<00:00:56.789> than<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> Traxxas<00:00:57.539> Slash<00:00:58.160> no<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.219> and

bigger than the Traxxas Slash no no and
this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> stuff<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.629> you

this is the stuff you get with it you
don't<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> battery<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
don't get the battery you just get the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.200 
don't get the battery you just get the
car<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:03.989> antenna<00:01:04.290> tube<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
car you get the little antenna tube and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.120 
car you get the little antenna tube and
you<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> 2.4<00:01:07.140> gigahertz<00:01:07.970> um

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
you get 2.4 gigahertz um

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.670 
you get 2.4 gigahertz um
remote<00:01:11.130> controller<00:01:11.810> with<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.380> don't

for now and then I also bought the arm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.969 
for now and then I also bought the arm
lipo<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.979> cell<00:01:20.549> lipo<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:22.229> bought<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.680> quick

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
lipo for cell lipo and I bought a quick

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.570 
lipo for cell lipo and I bought a quick
charge<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:25.009> I'm<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.310> bummed

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
charge off which I'm a bit bummed

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.690 
charge off which I'm a bit bummed
because<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.030> only<00:01:27.150> comes<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.979> on<00:01:28.979> ones<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.670> a
