are the top three things that vegans can

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
are the top three things that vegans can
do<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.859> increase<00:00:29.310> their<00:00:30.150> longevity<00:00:31.070> in<00:00:32.070> terms

do to increase their longevity in terms
of<00:00:32.460> life<00:00:32.610> span<00:00:32.940> beans<00:00:33.330> actually<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
of life span beans actually so it's a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
of life span beans actually so it's a
legume<00:00:34.739> consumption<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.640> pulse<00:00:35.879> consumption

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
vegetables so the study I recently

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
vegetables so the study I recently
profiled<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.150> nutrition<00:01:36.600> facts<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.960> are

profiled on nutrition facts that are

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.380 
profiled on nutrition facts that are
that<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.980> single<00:01:38.340> daily<00:01:38.610> salad<00:01:39.210> could

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that just a single daily salad could

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
that just a single daily salad could
literally<00:01:39.780> add<00:01:39.930> years<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.620> one's<00:01:40.860> life<00:01:41.100> span

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
literally add years to one's life span

literally add years to one's life span
right<00:01:41.730> healthy<00:01:42.300> years<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.960> these<00:01:43.080> aren't<00:01:43.290> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
right healthy years so these aren't just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.070 
right healthy years so these aren't just
you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.010> years<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.850> disability<00:01:45.510> healthy

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
you know years of disability healthy

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.660 
you know years of disability healthy
years<00:01:46.350> literally<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.190> doing<00:01:47.460> something

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
years literally just doing something

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.610 
years literally just doing something
that's<00:01:48.150> delicious<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.020> you're<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.230> second
