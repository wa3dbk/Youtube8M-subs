00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.729
 after an hour before the start of fc groningen fc utrecht it is already nice 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.919
 busy at the main entrance of the euroborg 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.639
 that is partly due to the new hospitality square but the supporters are the first 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.029
 six home games of the season for the kick-off can already be a little 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.609
 pick up if a little cozy here 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.249
 yes yes 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.640
 yes definitely this year amaro can go in the sun 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 when the weather is a bit less but a bit cold 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
 want to get some sun there the first time out of the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.350
 speed of a good initiative from the club 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.960
 yes it seems to me 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 part of animal welfare in the 2010 financial year 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.590
 my son sold the tickets for the dswn before that, but who knows 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.160
 be like a celebration 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.170
 as the chance that she is by her father of two children 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.300
 I have that of course 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.820
 the first time 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.640
 that is winning 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 what is it going to be deleted 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 and by how much 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.750
 from this season there is also an nfc chip is cafe 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 this is located right next to the wolff cinemas which makes you cozy here 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.980
 quite well 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 therefore you have to think about refusing a wall 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 get a picture of themselves 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.799
 there were many 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.009
 I do not know exactly where he has been busy in the past tense 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.680
 it was clearly a better match he was a week and then 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.220
 also a good earth 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.530
 Rotterdam 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.090
 8 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 I think 2 0 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.310
 because it continues to be the visitors of the hospitality square in the supporters' cafÃ© 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.280
 is positive 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.120
 but what about the expectations for this new season 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.730
 To get that question, we go to the Nieuwveen corner that is also for 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 the start of the first home game of this season is visited 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.050
 as last year for the coming season 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.500
 do it well 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.680
 we are going to end them 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.220
 direct european football 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 especially with last week's win, I don't think so 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.119
 what will the sun be at fc groningen no idea i hope it is right 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.859
 delft just no playoffs maybe there is section on a weak feedback 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.039
 to give 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.039
 give him places he blew a positive 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.409
 felt 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.899
 it's still a mystery 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.899
 last week we won 4 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.319
 we have something good with less bad 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.589
 but I think so 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.869
 a little passion and knowledge and the place 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.339
 more difficult 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.429
 I think so 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.249
 the 114 sun 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.769
 the afternoon 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.949
 mcqueen 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.319
 they are standing 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.829
 because market for one 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.829
 I see it in the last twelve years of 2009 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:52.139
 you see that
