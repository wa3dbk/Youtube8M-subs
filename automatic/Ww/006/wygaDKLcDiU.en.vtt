00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'm just gonna dye this once so I can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
I'm just gonna dye this once so I can
actually<00:01:12.900> leave<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.560> house<00:01:13.860> instead<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
actually leave my house instead of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.140 
actually leave my house instead of
looking<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.930> strange<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.759> will

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
looking very strange and then I will

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.800 
looking very strange and then I will
attempt<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> ombre<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.740> hair<00:01:20.330> after<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
attempt to ombre my hair after that and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.120 
attempt to ombre my hair after that and
I'm<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.080> sure<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> turn

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I'm not sure how that's going to turn

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
I'm not sure how that's going to turn
out<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:24.140> hopefully<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.330> that's<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
out but hopefully good and that's the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.030 
out but hopefully good and that's the
plan

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240 

it<00:01:32.580> came<00:01:32.910> out<00:01:33.120> pretty<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.920> considering<00:01:34.920> what

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it came out pretty well considering what

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
it came out pretty well considering what
color<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.970> before

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
color it was before

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
color it was before
I<00:01:36.960> can't<00:01:37.290> wait<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.560> ombre<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:39.180> you'll<00:01:39.840> see

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I can't wait to ombre it so you'll see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.220 
I can't wait to ombre it so you'll see
that<00:01:40.170> next<00:01:44.090> okay<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.240> yes<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.750> hair<00:01:45.960> looks

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
that next okay so yes my hair looks

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.200 
that next okay so yes my hair looks
totally<00:01:46.830> ridiculous<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.790> had<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.030> brush

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
totally ridiculous but I had to brush

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.620 
totally ridiculous but I had to brush
through<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.530> process<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.640> my

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
through it to do this process and my

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.360 
through it to do this process and my
hair<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.870> naturally<00:01:52.229> curly<00:01:52.260> so<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.190> what

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
hair is naturally curly so this is what

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.910 
hair is naturally curly so this is what
it<00:01:54.060> turns<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.780> brush<00:01:55.050> I'm<00:01:55.410> planning

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it turns out like my brush I'm planning

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.870 
it turns out like my brush I'm planning
on<00:01:56.040> putting<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.180> set<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.390> bleach<00:01:57.840> from

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
on putting the first set of bleach from

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.900 
on putting the first set of bleach from
about<00:01:59.930> here<00:02:00.930> down<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:02.670> gonna

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
about here down and I'm probably gonna

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.730 
about here down and I'm probably gonna
leave<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:05.900> 20<00:02:06.900> minutes<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.680> then

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
leave that in for 20 minutes and then

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.050 
leave that in for 20 minutes and then
I'm<00:02:08.670> gonna<00:02:08.790> come<00:02:09.149> back<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.700> bring<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.760> up

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

I'm gonna come back and bring it up
higher<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.910> weave<00:02:18.209> it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
higher to about here and like weave it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.740 
higher to about here and like weave it
through<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:19.650> part<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.280> well<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.600> gonna

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
through this part as well and I'm gonna

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.060 
through this part as well and I'm gonna
leave<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.730> maybe<00:02:26.570> 15<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.989> then<00:02:28.920> I'm

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
leave that in for maybe 15 and then I'm

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.309 
leave that in for maybe 15 and then I'm
going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.280> wash<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.820> out

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.890 

it<00:02:35.319> smells<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:36.569> lot<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:40.239> I'm<00:02:40.359> just<00:02:40.540> trying<00:02:40.719> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it smells a lot so I'm just trying to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.149 
it smells a lot so I'm just trying to

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
you're on the fence about doing this it

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.080 
you're on the fence about doing this it
was<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:47.690> easy<00:05:48.020> if<00:05:48.830> you've<00:05:48.980> watched<00:05:49.310> tutorials

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
was so easy if you've watched tutorials

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.020 
was so easy if you've watched tutorials
on<00:05:50.300> YouTube<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:51.740> really<00:05:52.130> just<00:05:52.400> do<00:05:52.910> exactly

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030

on YouTube you really just do exactly
what<00:05:53.660> they<00:05:53.840> say<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.770> it<00:05:55.370> works<00:05:55.700> I<00:05:56.120> guess

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480
