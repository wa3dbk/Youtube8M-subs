origins myths and mysteries so today we

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.820 
origins myths and mysteries so today we
look<00:00:06.330> at<00:00:06.480> free<00:00:06.750> very<00:00:07.080> quick<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.560> simple

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
look at free very quick and simple

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.850 
look at free very quick and simple
theories<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.730> myths<00:00:09.410> first<00:00:10.410> up<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:10.740> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
theories or myths first up we have a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.390 
theories or myths first up we have a
nice<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.219> evolution<00:00:11.849> theory<00:00:12.950> now<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.219> ever

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
nice an evolution theory now if you ever

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.609 
nice an evolution theory now if you ever
notice<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.820> Rotom<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.420> body<00:00:15.690> its<00:00:16.139> actual

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
notice that Rotom is body its actual

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.080 
notice that Rotom is body its actual
body<00:00:16.830> not<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> electricity<00:00:17.730> coming<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
body not the electricity coming off of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.990 
body not the electricity coming off of
it<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> orange<00:00:19.650> body<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.670> very

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it but just the orange body is very

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
it but just the orange body is very
similar<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.260> imagine<00:00:22.410> shop

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
similar to what you would imagine shop

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
similar to what you would imagine shop
its<00:00:23.160> body<00:00:23.369> being<00:00:23.670> without<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> cloth

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
its body being without the cloth

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.099 
its body being without the cloth
covering<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.150> while<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> put<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> cloth<00:00:27.930> over

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
covering so while you put a cloth over

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.580 
covering so while you put a cloth over
Rotom<00:00:28.800> say<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:29.939> example<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.539> reaper<00:00:31.080> cloth<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
Rotom say for example a reaper cloth and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
Rotom say for example a reaper cloth and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
evolution method synonymous with ghost

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.490 
evolution method synonymous with ghost
types<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.710> both<00:00:35.130> Rotem<00:00:35.520> own<00:00:35.610> shop<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:35.940> are

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
types which both Rotem own shop at are

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
types which both Rotem own shop at are
the<00:00:37.500> cloth<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.920> insulate<00:00:38.309> wrote<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.640> with

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the cloth would insulate wrote on with

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
the cloth would insulate wrote on with
electricity<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.480> reduce<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> ball<00:00:40.559> with

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
electricity and reduce it to a ball with

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.540 
electricity and reduce it to a ball with
the<00:00:41.399> cloth<00:00:41.610> hanging<00:00:41.879> over<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.860> hence<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.129> loses

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the cloth hanging over it hence it loses

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
the cloth hanging over it hence it loses
electric<00:00:45.000> typing<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.600> becomes<00:00:45.930> simply<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
electric typing and becomes simply a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
electric typing and becomes simply a
ghost<00:00:46.710> type<00:00:46.950> shop<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.870> guys

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
ghost type shop it what do you guys

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.700 
ghost type shop it what do you guys
think<00:00:50.960> next<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.170> length<00:00:52.440> ferry

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
think next up we have length ferry

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.060 
think next up we have length ferry
surrounding<00:00:53.219> Haunter<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.940> applicable<00:00:55.070> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
surrounding Haunter and applicable so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.380 
surrounding Haunter and applicable so
what<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.309> happen<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.789> took<00:00:56.910> haunt<00:00:57.239> his

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
what would happen if we took haunt his

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410 
what would happen if we took haunt his
eyes<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.800> per<00:00:59.039> google<00:00:59.420> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
eyes and put them on a per google that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
eyes and put them on a per google that
would<00:01:00.629> happen<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.859> looks<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.280> similar

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
would happen and what looks very similar

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170 
would happen and what looks very similar
to<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.850> yes<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.719> vote<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> maybe<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.670> Voltorb

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to that yes a vote or so maybe a Voltorb

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
to that yes a vote or so maybe a Voltorb
is<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> polka<00:01:06.900> water<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.229> possessed<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
is a polka water is possessed by a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
is a polka water is possessed by a
Haunter<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.330> huntress<00:01:09.810> trapped<00:01:10.200> inside

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Haunter and the huntress trapped inside

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
Haunter and the huntress trapped inside
hence<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> lack<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> button<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
hence the lack of the button from the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.080 
hence the lack of the button from the
pokeball<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.740> eventually<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.310> Voltorb

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pokeball so eventually this Voltorb

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.649 
pokeball so eventually this Voltorb
Haunter<00:01:15.780> combo<00:01:16.549> explodes<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.820> escape<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Haunter combo explodes to escape this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
Haunter combo explodes to escape this
would<00:01:18.840> explain<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.170> water<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.920> learn<00:01:20.070> both

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
would explain how water can learn both

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
would explain how water can learn both
self-destruct<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.180> explosion<00:01:21.900> again<00:01:22.890> what

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
self-destruct and explosion again what

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
self-destruct and explosion again what
are<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.369> guys<00:01:23.520> thoughts<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:25.610> finally<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
are your guys thoughts and finally we

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
are your guys thoughts and finally we
look<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.060> Kabutops<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.680> learn<00:01:28.860> from

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
look at Kabutops here we learn from

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.149 
look at Kabutops here we learn from
kabuto's<00:01:29.520> pokedex<00:01:30.030> entry<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.259> inhabited

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
kabuto's pokedex entry that it inhabited

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.090 
kabuto's pokedex entry that it inhabited
beaches<00:01:32.579> 300<00:01:33.240> million<00:01:33.450> years<00:01:33.780> ago<00:01:34.100> so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
beaches 300 million years ago so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
beaches 300 million years ago so
therefore<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> matter<00:01:36.450> both

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
therefore we can take the matter both

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.140 
therefore we can take the matter both
Kabuto<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> Kabutops<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.490> been<00:01:38.729> around<00:01:38.909> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
Kabuto and Kabutops have been around for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
Kabuto and Kabutops have been around for
over<00:01:39.210> 300<00:01:39.869> million<00:01:40.020> years<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.000> now<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.060> we

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
over 300 million years and now if we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
over 300 million years and now if we
bring<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> genesect<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> look<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.950> dex

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
bring in genesect and look it's dex

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
bring in genesect and look it's dex

wouldn't know anything about Kabutops

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.499 
wouldn't know anything about Kabutops
since<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.250> native<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.299> were

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
since they are native or what were

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
since they are native or what were
native<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.380> Kanto<00:02:07.680> region<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> maybe<00:02:09.390> they

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
native to the Kanto region so maybe they

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.330 
native to the Kanto region so maybe they
revived<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> modified<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.099> some<00:02:11.340> ways

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
revived it and modified it in some ways

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.520 
revived it and modified it in some ways
on<00:02:12.519> some<00:02:12.760> purple<00:02:13.090> armor<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> drive<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.410> its

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
on some purple armor and a drive to its

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.729 
on some purple armor and a drive to its
back<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.040> BAM<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> genesect<00:02:16.739> so

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
back and then BAM you have a genesect so

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.530 
back and then BAM you have a genesect so
we<00:02:17.890> may<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.040> able<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.310> conclude<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:19.060> genesect

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
we may be able to conclude that genesect

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.080 
we may be able to conclude that genesect
is<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.840> Kabutops<00:02:20.560> or<00:02:20.830> at<00:02:21.340> least<00:02:21.489> very<00:02:21.550> closely

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
is a Kabutops or at least very closely

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.869 
is a Kabutops or at least very closely
related<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.190> ask<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.580> again

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
related to one I ask of you all again

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.190 
related to one I ask of you all again
what<00:02:25.690> do<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.810> think<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:28.300> guys<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.840> concludes

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
what do you think so guys that concludes

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.140 
what do you think so guys that concludes
today's<00:02:29.290> video<00:02:29.830> fairly<00:02:30.670> short<00:02:30.940> but<00:02:31.120> I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
today's video fairly short but I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.339 
today's video fairly short but I
couldn't<00:02:31.450> really<00:02:31.569> crab<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> anything<00:02:32.260> else

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
couldn't really crab and anything else

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.809 
couldn't really crab and anything else
from<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:32.650> these<00:02:32.769> three<00:02:33.010> theories<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.670> it's

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
from all these three theories but it's

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.300 
from all these three theories but it's
better<00:02:33.970> than<00:02:34.060> want<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.599> isn't<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:34.989> guys

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
better than want there isn't it guys

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.890 
better than want there isn't it guys
anyway<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> runs<00:02:36.640> between<00:02:36.849> next<00:02:37.209> time<00:02:37.390> I'll<00:02:37.629> be

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
anyway it runs between next time I'll be

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.170 
anyway it runs between next time I'll be
seeing<00:02:38.110> you
