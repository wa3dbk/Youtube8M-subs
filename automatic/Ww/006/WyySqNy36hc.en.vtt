syncing with iCloud is very spotty now
i'm<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.700> sure<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.330> game<00:02:24.540> itself<00:02:24.840> or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
i'm not sure if it's the game itself or

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320 
i'm not sure if it's the game itself or
iCloud<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.860> others<00:02:26.250> are<00:02:26.430> reporting<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.060> same
