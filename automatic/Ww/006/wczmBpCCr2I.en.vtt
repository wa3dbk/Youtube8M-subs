much symmetry
in<00:00:22.720> my<00:00:22.869> face<00:00:23.140> so<00:00:23.470> I<00:00:23.500> want<00:00:23.680> more<00:00:24.040> harmony<00:00:24.550> as<00:00:25.270> far

what<00:02:34.010> you've<00:02:34.159> also<00:02:34.930> wanted<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.200> talk<00:02:36.379> about<00:02:36.409> as

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
what you've also wanted to talk about as

a<00:02:36.799> chin<00:02:37.099> implant<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:37.939> that<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.209> very

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
a chin implant and I think that is very

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.929 
a chin implant and I think that is very
important<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:39.379> those<00:02:40.340> two<00:02:40.670> midline

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
important because those two midline

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.729 
important because those two midline
structures<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.510> nose<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.049> chin<00:02:42.260> go

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
structures the nose and the chin go

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.699 
structures the nose and the chin go
