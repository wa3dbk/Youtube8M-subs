00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 to forget 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.730

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.329
 Dubai was once a young rock in the surf 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.999

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.580

 But Norbert Schatz surprises Range 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.940
 the kidneys now that I know it's important that we also have this

 great honor at the Coba the two hours have always been the card 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.500
 Franken so dome the foresight who on the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.530
 Franks 20 years he had declared apparently there is a good foreman 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.250
 going 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 here is obvious 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.050
 years 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.710
 Bad Abbach leaves 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.790
 Rostock dapd it does not matter, it's a nice game 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.469
 a good start that would not be so much fun and noticed 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.359
 and then suddenly ran 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:18.010
 Chalupka have made it represent they have failed to start with this 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.329
 the same was the case with all 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 to care 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.979
 we take 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.979
 at TuS St 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.139
 I do not understand now but the 70s 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 What 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.419
 so that would be just because I know him Bayer because of that 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.219
 if you really can not remove yourself 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.859
 No worries we have to think about entering it is said that we are on 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.859
 Start okay thanks 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.259
 So a few weeks longer 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:11.619
 thank you right after receiving the term Wilfried BOS b figured out look 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:12.739
 smart 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.590
 we think I believe that Werder and hurled 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.229
 that would mean 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.689
 stands against Mainz everything 1 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.329
 everything is just a transmitter RTBF the guide is very vague 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.319
 Barclays has 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.779
 everyone should know 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.129
 kinda cool it's going well now 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.829
 the steppkes are a bit different from his point of view, the blacksmith a second 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.819
 Raich also feel totally skin at first 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.169
 such numbers exhibitors 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.169
 so was bogged down because of 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.759
 also in or 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.769
 I can be here 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.769
 it must not be what I am now strictly against it 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.589
 the stringency of what it was about 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:06.809
 damned ax as older in the road way out there she was, too 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:12.469
 there on a Global 1 if he is very alright I've cashed is presses 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.679
 on the button 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.679
 a try not a single last attempt 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.169
 friend 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.430
 until 11 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.580
 okay secured is they have to jump because kaprun speak explosive belt 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.719
 that's all my blessing consensus is knew but I do not care about cheating 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.529
 it looks like it will be here 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.659
 the markets are the reason with the pirates and we have the Robert j 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:48.549
 Despite being in Saarland Nalan Lahm was for the time being at Simba and Nala exactly 

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:53.029
 what is that again file finds no idea well dapd continues 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:59.219
 he is often not exclude he is also the island I feel 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.969
 me 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.969
 not so stupid that is certainly not have to move 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.719
 came to Como va 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.219
 However, right at the moment he is not the first exciting thing was clear 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.029
 logically more on shelves 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.969
 we have here 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.439
 8 8 too 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.779
 the start phase to Aachen 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.729
 completely in German the word but then again 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.580
 World s 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.099
 next to there 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.099
 First of all, the result has to be banished from the other side 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.430
 Niemeyer had apparently coped with that, "Zapatero said there 

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:44.539
 Passengers save Christophe and every disc is weird so this 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.680
 Game is not really shit anymore 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.210
 but now everyone use 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.210
 The hit 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.319
 the lok-eleven 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.629
 17 Chelsea will, too, as I have said 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.080
 good piece of Schweinfurt she meant by Birgit Schrowange and hopefully 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 hopefully a moon car so Ron Krauss spreads 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.930
 I wish you a nice day, the Supreme Court has been postponed 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.460
 and exit
