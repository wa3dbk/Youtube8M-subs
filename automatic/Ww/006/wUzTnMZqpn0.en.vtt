00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.999 

it's<00:00:19.749> not<00:00:19.929> the<00:00:20.050> sort<00:00:20.259> of<00:00:20.349> race<00:00:20.529> thought<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.890> get

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
it's not the sort of race thought to get

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.300 
it's not the sort of race thought to get
tailed<00:00:21.310> off<00:00:21.519> in<00:00:21.699> too<00:00:21.910> much<00:00:22.119> so<00:00:22.710> let's<00:00:23.710> see<00:00:23.949> what

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
tailed off in too much so let's see what

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.560 
tailed off in too much so let's see what
happens<00:00:24.759> we'll<00:00:24.939> get<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:25.119> pretty<00:00:25.419> good

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
happens we'll get a pretty good

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.529 
happens we'll get a pretty good
indication<00:00:25.960> early<00:00:26.439> on<00:00:26.589> I<00:00:26.619> think<00:00:26.800> it's<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.539> what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
indication early on I think it's to what

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.720 
indication early on I think it's to what
the<00:00:28.840> first<00:00:29.079> few<00:00:29.559> laps<00:00:29.739> I<00:00:29.980> don't<00:00:30.160> expect<00:00:30.550> them

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
the first few laps I don't expect them

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.249 
the first few laps I don't expect them
there<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.059> be<00:00:31.149> too<00:00:31.329> far<00:00:31.509> off<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.779> pacemaker

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
there to be too far off the pacemaker

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.569 
there to be too far off the pacemaker
what<00:00:32.500> happened<00:00:32.829> it's<00:00:32.949> what<00:00:33.100> happens<00:00:33.399> when<00:00:33.489> the

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
what happened it's what happens when the

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.790 
what happened it's what happens when the
pacemakers<00:00:34.120> drop<00:00:34.360> out<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.750> then<00:00:34.809> they<00:00:35.500> really

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
pacemakers drop out and then they really

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.180 
pacemakers drop out and then they really
all<00:00:35.920> start<00:00:36.250> looking<00:00:36.519> at<00:00:36.610> each<00:00:36.699> other<00:00:36.940> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
all start looking at each other and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.130 
all start looking at each other and
paste<00:00:39.190> drops<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:40.000> we<00:00:40.239> end<00:00:40.659> up<00:00:40.720> with<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:40.930> big

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
paste drops and we end up with a big

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.420 
paste drops and we end up with a big
sprint<00:00:41.440> finish<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:41.949> then<00:00:42.040> we'll<00:00:42.190> get<00:00:42.280> the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
sprint finish and then we'll get the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.520 
sprint finish and then we'll get the
inevitable<00:00:43.059> result<00:00:43.479> the<00:00:43.780> Vivian<00:00:44.140> chariot
