00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
96 heading let's go ahead and let's see

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.990 
96 heading let's go ahead and let's see
how<00:00:27.660> much<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.960> paid<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.380> him<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.650> prepared

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
how much we paid for him so we prepared

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
how much we paid for him so we prepared
1.3<00:00:30.000> million<00:00:30.510> coins<00:00:31.019> he<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.500> bought<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.949> day

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
1.3 million coins he was bought the day

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
1.3 million coins he was bought the day
after<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> team<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> attackers<00:00:33.570> came<00:00:33.719> out

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
after the team of the attackers came out

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
after the team of the attackers came out
so<00:00:34.079> his<00:00:34.500> price<00:00:34.770> has<00:00:34.950> probably<00:00:35.280> gone<00:00:35.579> down

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so his price has probably gone down

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.729 
so his price has probably gone down
quite<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.630> probably<00:00:36.930> will<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
quite a bit and I probably will make a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
quite a bit and I probably will make a
bit<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> loss<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.820> guy<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.629> hey<00:00:39.750> you

I'm stunned a bit shocked about his long
shots<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:32.909> long<00:01:33.119> shots<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.540> very

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
shots because his long shots are very

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.149 
shots because his long shots are very
very<00:01:34.140> good<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.350> thought<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
very good I thought there will be in the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
very good I thought there will be in the
high<00:01:35.280> 90s<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.970> least<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.140> ahead<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
high 90s at least let's go ahead and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.359 
high 90s at least let's go ahead and
let's<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.979> player<00:01:38.189> information

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
let's go into the player information

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
let's go into the player information
we've<00:01:38.790> already<00:01:38.939> been<00:01:39.150> through<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.689> as

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
we've already been through that but as

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120 
we've already been through that but as
you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.049> he's<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> high<00:01:40.560> attacking

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you can see he's got a high attacking

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
you can see he's got a high attacking
work<00:01:41.280> great<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.180> medium<00:01:42.570> defensive

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
work great and a medium defensive

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
work great and a medium defensive
workrate<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.710> more<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.729> would<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.939> been

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
workrate that more it would have been

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.429 
workrate that more it would have been
better<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.630> low<00:01:45.869> difference<00:01:46.200> worker

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
better to have a low difference worker

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
better to have a low difference worker
it<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:46.740> those<00:01:46.950> stats<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.549> very<00:01:47.700> good

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it but those stats are very very good

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.569 
it but those stats are very very good
for<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> striker<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.310> go<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> the
