00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.529
 moin moin and welcome here 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.500
 from the 19 75 what this pipe wrench with 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.630
 360 ° video on the iphone has to do yes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.630
 that would like to know stays there 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 Take 360 ​​° videos with the iphone 5 4 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.190
 s or with the iphone 4 no problem 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.740
 I have that from the company 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.180
 I come to the review footage what 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.920
 I can record you have seen 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.410
 No matter why I use a pipe wrench 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.210
 I needed the lens on the snap 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 and install for iphone 5 because 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 at delivery, the lens is on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 the holder for the iphone 4s on it all 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.310
 easy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 it barely settled with bare hands 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:02.160
 Uninstalling one screwed is namely 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:05.160
 that's the attitude that looks like without 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.290
 and this is the lens solo 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.530
 this is enclosed separately and you 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.410
 you have to unscrew the lens and then it is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.479
 on the bracket for the iphone 5 on 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.369
 to be able to screw 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.310
 The only problem with the story is that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.890
 I unscrew it from the bracket 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.690
 for 44 s we do not bare hands 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.020
 got the part done 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 was screwed on so hard that I was myself 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.929
 forced to look 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.690
 then to use the pipe wrench went 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.729
 but also reasonably natural 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.530
 just a little bit from the outside 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.929
 optical damage suffered the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 does not stay out unfortunately I do not know 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.770
 whether that by default, so hard 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 I can actually screwed on 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 say 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 From the result I have to say is quite 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.789
 new stupid was the weather right now 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 It's been gray in gray for weeks though 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:59.459
 are themselves like the artwork 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.920
 Look here you can see in the bottom 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.900
 area the original part I have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.230
 naturally placed in the foreground 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.670
 and the big picture is in the background 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.050
 out of the app 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 of course this is a bit large 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.960
 healthy as it is by the way quite okay like that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.820
 original case but the advantage is that 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.070
 because you can train so so of 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.000
 Pan left to right is one 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.280
 a little bit like espionage so very much 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 petty if you do not quite do it now 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.460
 so big and I have it for now 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.100
 Video made it a bit 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.080
 better but what if you see it in the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.010
 original is the picture quality synonymous 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.740
 much better from therefore I find that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.240
 360 ° video films quite cool sound is coming 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.250
 of course from the iphone and is therefore 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.990
 not quite as tingling as you should 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 maybe consider external mick 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.560
 still to buy 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.120
 that was the visual material that i did now 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.120
 I took close to the university 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 Berlin weather and location is now 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.510
 Of course not so tingling but me 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.090
 just wanted to show you just how it is 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.390
 generally looks the order bildmaterial 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.650
 with the lens and the iphone 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.470
 You still need to be able to do that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.019
 appropriate app that means loose the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.940
 is free and you can find it in the app store 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.800
 of course, I have the link in the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.390
 isp posted bio description you justjährigenürt 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.620
 then you will be automatically in the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.720
 appstore connected 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.600
 if you started the app you should 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.390
 calibrate it for a short while but that will be yours 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.010
 also made easy you just have to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.239
 wish and zoom and back and forth 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 push it so it clearly sits yes that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.880
 was that then you need it 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.860
 only record 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.810
 you have different options for 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 app i do not want much more words 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.260
 because she is relative 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.600
 self-explanatory simply incomprehensible 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.220
 if you still need help video 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 needs or a review 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
