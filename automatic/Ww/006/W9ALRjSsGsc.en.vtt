need to be able to go into there and
there's<00:00:46.120> two<00:00:46.329> parts<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.690> one<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.079> what<00:00:47.200> the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
there's two parts that one is what the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
government require and then the second

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.370 
government require and then the second
part<00:00:48.880> is<00:00:49.000> what<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.239> FEI<00:00:49.480> required<00:00:49.930> for<00:00:50.079> an<00:00:50.170> FEI

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
competitions such as the Olympics so we

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.330 
competitions such as the Olympics so we
have<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.989> make<00:00:53.230> sure<00:00:53.380> that<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.710> blood<00:00:53.860> tests

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
have to make sure that the blood tests

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.979 
have to make sure that the blood tests
and<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.489> flu<00:00:54.730> vaccinations<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.600> meet<00:00:55.750> both

and the flu vaccinations and meet both

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.950 
and the flu vaccinations and meet both
of<00:00:56.020> those<00:00:56.260> requirements<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:58.780> not

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
of those requirements so it's it's not

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.630 
of those requirements so it's it's not
it's<00:00:59.140> not<00:00:59.260> overly<00:00:59.620> complicated<00:01:00.160> for<00:01:00.309> England

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
it's not overly complicated for England

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.060 
it's not overly complicated for England

guess give a bit more advice specific to

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.979 
guess give a bit more advice specific to
the<00:02:28.640> air<00:02:28.760> stables<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:29.329> travel<00:02:29.659> in<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.840> case

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the air stables they travel in in case

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.479 
the air stables they travel in in case
we<00:02:30.140> need<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.290> make<00:02:30.500> any<00:02:30.709> changes<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.250> any

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
we need to make any changes there any

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.339 
we need to make any changes there any
problems<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.329> certification<00:02:33.019> along<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
problems with certification along the

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.440 
problems with certification along the
way<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.860> also<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.700> experience<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.299> flying

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
way and also just experience of flying

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
way and also just experience of flying
literally<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.650> know<00:02:36.739> weekly<00:02:37.220> with<00:02:37.370> horses<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
literally you know weekly with horses to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.789 
literally you know weekly with horses to
to<00:02:38.540> try<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.900> stop<00:02:39.290> some<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> things

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
to try and stop some of the things

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:40.690 
to try and stop some of the things
before<00:02:40.069> they<00:02:40.190> occur

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
before they occur

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.119 
before they occur
how<00:02:41.269> much<00:02:41.450> feed<00:02:41.750> goes<00:02:42.079> on<00:02:42.470> them<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:42.920> plane

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
how much feed goes on them on the plane

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.309 
how much feed goes on them on the plane
with<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.430> horses<00:02:43.670> yeah<00:02:44.209> look<00:02:44.450> typically<00:02:44.989> we

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
with the horses yeah look typically we

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.680 
with the horses yeah look typically we
only<00:02:45.620> try<00:02:46.159> and<00:02:46.280> feed<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.549> horses<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:47.209> hay<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
only try and feed the horses of hay and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.149 
only try and feed the horses of hay and
things<00:02:47.840> like<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.079> rather<00:02:48.260> than<00:02:48.470> hard<00:02:48.769> grains

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
things like that rather than hard grains

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.890 
things like that rather than hard grains
and<00:02:49.430> feeds<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:49.879> we<00:02:49.970> don't<00:02:50.180> want<00:02:50.329> to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and feeds because we don't want to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.809 
and feeds because we don't want to
increase<00:02:51.470> any<00:02:51.739> risk<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.129> colic<00:02:52.459> during<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
increase any risk of colic during the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.259 
increase any risk of colic during the
flight

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
flight

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.330 
flight
so<00:02:53.629> look<00:02:54.170> probably<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.829> flight<00:02:55.069> would

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
so look probably on this flight would

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.839 
so look probably on this flight would
have<00:02:55.670> around<00:02:56.510> about<00:02:57.010> 20<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.159> 40<00:02:58.190> litres<00:02:58.819> per

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
have around about 20 to 40 litres per

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.729 
have around about 20 to 40 litres per
horse<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.510> water<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:00.170> also<00:03:00.440> probably<00:03:00.680> a

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
horse of water and then also probably a

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.190 
horse of water and then also probably a
bale<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:00.950> hay<00:03:01.099> each<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.670> if<00:03:02.599> we<00:03:02.780> need<00:03:02.959> anything

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
bale of hay each and if we need anything

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.569 
bale of hay each and if we need anything
else<00:03:03.440> along<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.829> way<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.099> can<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.489> it

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
else along the way we can have it

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.649 
else along the way we can have it
delivered<00:03:04.670> out<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> airport<00:03:05.420> but

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
delivered out to the airport but

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.449 
delivered out to the airport but
typically<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.230> try<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:07.159> give<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
typically we try and just give it to

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.780 
typically we try and just give it to
that<00:03:07.639> and<00:03:08.680> what's<00:03:09.680> what's<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.579> most

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that and what's what's the most

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.190 
that and what's what's the most
difficult<00:03:11.239> part<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.690> journey<00:03:11.930> for<00:03:12.019> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
difficult part of the journey for the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.619 
difficult part of the journey for the
horses<00:03:12.650> look<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.670> think<00:03:13.730> probably<00:03:14.359> the

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
horses look I think probably the

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.770 
horses look I think probably the
recovery<00:03:15.079> afterwards<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.950> hardest<00:03:16.430> bit

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
recovery afterwards is the hardest bit

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.970 
recovery afterwards is the hardest bit
once<00:03:17.780> you're<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.139> airport<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.709> owners

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
once you're at the airport the owners

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.099 
once you're at the airport the owners
can<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.310> flashing<00:03:19.609> lights<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.299> noises<00:03:20.840> and

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
can be flashing lights and noises and

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.259 
can be flashing lights and noises and
heavy<00:03:21.829> engineering<00:03:22.280> top<00:03:22.579> equipment<00:03:23.030> like<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
heavy engineering top equipment like the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.789 
heavy engineering top equipment like the
lighter<00:03:23.480> they<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:23.870> them<00:03:24.049> on<00:03:24.139> to<00:03:24.319> play<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.680> so

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
lighter they get them on to play and so

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.259 
lighter they get them on to play and so
certainly<00:03:25.129> you<00:03:25.400> hope<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.090> they<00:03:26.209> stay

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
certainly you hope that they stay

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.089 
certainly you hope that they stay
settled<00:03:26.900> during<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.230> process<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.799> certainly

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
settled during that process or certainly

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.009 
settled during that process or certainly
once<00:03:28.669> they<00:03:28.819> get<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.120> board<00:03:29.389> they<00:03:29.540> settle<00:03:29.870> down

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
once they get on board they settle down

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.500 
once they get on board they settle down
pretty<00:03:30.410> quick<00:03:30.849> during<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.940> flight<00:03:32.120> itself<00:03:32.359> is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
pretty quick during the flight itself is

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.390 
pretty quick during the flight itself is
probably<00:03:32.660> takeoff<00:03:33.169> and<00:03:33.290> landings<00:03:33.739> yeah<00:03:34.010> as<00:03:34.340> a

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
probably takeoff and landings yeah as a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.159 
probably takeoff and landings yeah as a
passenger<00:03:34.699> yourself<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:35.299> saw<00:03:35.449> most<00:03:35.870> alert

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
passenger yourself you saw most alert

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.720 
passenger yourself you saw most alert
you<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.410> those<00:03:36.590> times<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.160> see<00:03:37.549> what's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
you in those times to see what's

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.770 
you in those times to see what's
happening<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> horses<00:03:38.449> are<00:03:38.660> no

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
happening and the horses are no

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.809 
happening and the horses are no
different<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:39.889> look<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.129> key<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
different and then look the key to the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.979 
different and then look the key to the
horses<00:03:41.120> though<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.329> once<00:03:41.599> they<00:03:41.690> get<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
horses though is once they get to the

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.539 
horses though is once they get to the
other<00:03:42.049> end<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.440> first<00:03:42.650> 48<00:03:43.129> hours<00:03:43.340> after

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
other end the first 48 hours after

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.860 
other end the first 48 hours after
they've<00:03:43.879> arrived<00:03:44.239> you're<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.660> give<00:03:44.780> you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
they've arrived you're going to give you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.300 
they've arrived you're going to give you
a<00:03:44.900> pretty<00:03:45.199> clear<00:03:45.230> indication<00:03:45.919> of<00:03:45.980> how<00:03:46.129> they

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
a pretty clear indication of how they

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.490 
a pretty clear indication of how they
have<00:03:46.459> travelled<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:48.079> how<00:03:48.260> they're<00:03:48.410> going

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
have travelled and and how they're going

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.690 
have travelled and and how they're going
to<00:03:48.590> go<00:03:48.709> in<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.000> weeks<00:03:50.329> after<00:03:50.540> that
