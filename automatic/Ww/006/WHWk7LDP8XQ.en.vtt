00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.240 
actually going to be coming out with it
in<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> pressed<00:01:51.000> urea<00:01:51.509> material<00:01:52.259> that'll<00:01:53.130> be

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
in this pressed urea material that'll be

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
in this pressed urea material that'll be
distressed<00:01:53.790> looking<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.390> it'll<00:01:54.540> actually

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
distressed looking so it'll actually

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.389 
distressed looking so it'll actually
each<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> pieces<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
each of the pieces will kind of be a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
each of the pieces will kind of be a
domino<00:01:56.939> length<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:58.290> we're<00:01:58.500> hoping

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
domino length but what we're hoping

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
domino length but what we're hoping
that'll<00:01:59.100> actually<00:01:59.219> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> look<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.939> cut

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that'll actually kind of look like a cut

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.969 
that'll actually kind of look like a cut
out<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.020> rock<00:02:01.229> type<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.950> tile

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
out of a rock type of tile

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.760 
out of a rock type of tile
but<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.729> gameplay<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.540> very<00:02:05.899> similar<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
but the gameplay is very similar and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.710 
but the gameplay is very similar and
exactly<00:02:07.340> how<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.579> is<00:02:07.670> before<00:02:08.090> you're<00:02:08.300> moving

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
exactly how it is before you're moving

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.359 
exactly how it is before you're moving
based<00:02:09.319> upon<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.770> pattern<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.250> have

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
based upon the pattern that you have

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.370 
based upon the pattern that you have
then<00:02:10.729> you're<00:02:10.819> flipping<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.239> tile<00:02:11.480> over<00:02:11.810> okay

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
then you're flipping the tile over okay

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.920 
then you're flipping the tile over okay
we<00:02:13.069> are<00:02:13.220> accentuating<00:02:14.209> some<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.720> rules

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
we are accentuating some of the rules

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.420 
we are accentuating some of the rules
that<00:02:15.380> were<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.709> base<00:02:15.890> set<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that were in the base set that the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.550 
that were in the base set that the
original<00:02:16.819> tiles<00:02:17.090> didn't<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.349> for

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
original tiles didn't have so for

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.160 
original tiles didn't have so for
example<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.250> shield<00:02:19.610> there<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.630> defense

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
example the shield there the defense

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.240 
example the shield there the defense
token<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:23.090> well<00:02:23.330> as<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.900> dread<00:02:24.260> icons<00:02:24.739> both<00:02:25.099> of

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
token as well as the dread icons both of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.680 
token as well as the dread icons both of
those<00:02:25.370> were<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> rule<00:02:25.970> books<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.480> never

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
those were in the rule books they never

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.110 
those were in the rule books they never
appeared<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.290> any<00:02:27.470> tile<00:02:27.830> oh<00:02:28.040> okay<00:02:28.580> there's

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
appeared on any tile oh okay there's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.420 
appeared on any tile oh okay there's
lots<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.690> shield<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.200> here<00:02:30.440> okay<00:02:30.800> however

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
lots of shield on here okay however

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.289 
lots of shield on here okay however
there<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> no<00:02:32.870> slide<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:34.310> any<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.120> these

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
there is no slide on any one of these

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.240 
there is no slide on any one of these
tiles<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.290> they're<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.560> nearly<00:02:36.980> as

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
tiles so they're not nearly as

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.620 
tiles so they're not nearly as
maneuverable<00:02:37.580> but<00:02:38.299> they<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.480> these<00:02:38.569> great

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
maneuverable but they have these great

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.440 
maneuverable but they have these great
overlapping<00:02:39.620> shield<00:02:40.250> walls<00:02:40.549> very<00:02:40.760> Vikings

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
overlapping shield walls very Vikings

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.630 
overlapping shield walls very Vikings
really<00:02:41.720> okay<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:43.100> actually<00:02:43.400> one<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.580> my

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
really okay and then actually one of my

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.430 
really okay and then actually one of my
favorite<00:02:44.269> tiles<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.720> here's<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.140> shield

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
favorite tiles and here's the shield

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.140 
favorite tiles and here's the shield
maiden<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.069> introduced<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.580> brand<00:02:46.760> new

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
maiden and we introduced a brand new

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.710 
maiden and we introduced a brand new
icon<00:02:47.630> which<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.830> shield<00:02:49.190> defense<00:02:49.819> and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
icon which is the shield defense and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.809 
icon which is the shield defense and
what<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.140> does<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.799> any<00:02:51.950> tile<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:52.610> in

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
what that does is any tile that is in

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.789 
what that does is any tile that is in
these<00:02:53.000> two<00:02:53.209> locations<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:54.380> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> be

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
these two locations is going to be

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.890 
these two locations is going to be
completely<00:02:55.280> protected<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:56.269> can't<00:02:56.569> get<00:02:56.780> them

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
completely protected you can't get them

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.309 
completely protected you can't get them
okay<00:02:57.760> but<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.090> doesn't<00:02:59.450> protect<00:02:59.870> this<00:02:59.989> one<00:03:00.200> at

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
okay but it doesn't protect this one at

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.470 
okay but it doesn't protect this one at
all<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.040> she<00:03:01.069> jumps<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.730> gets<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.269> Duke

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
all so she jumps in gets with the Duke

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.960 
all so she jumps in gets with the Duke
the<00:03:03.380> Duke<00:03:03.530> gets<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.099> yarra<00:03:04.400> oh<00:03:04.730> yeah

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the Duke gets with the yarra oh yeah

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.940 
the Duke gets with the yarra oh yeah
starts<00:03:05.569> protecting<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.200> suddenly<00:03:06.769> she

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
starts protecting it and suddenly she

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.830 
starts protecting it and suddenly she
becomes<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.459> target<00:03:07.730> -<00:03:08.030> or<00:03:08.239> as<00:03:08.450> everyone's

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
becomes the target - or as everyone's

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.410 
becomes the target - or as everyone's
like<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.109> got<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.410> get<00:03:09.470> rid<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:09.859> shield<00:03:10.100> me

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
like I got to get rid of that shield me

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.509 
like I got to get rid of that shield me
however<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.049> our<00:03:12.709> favorite<00:03:13.130> parts<00:03:13.310> and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
however one of our favorite parts and

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.009 
however one of our favorite parts and
this<00:03:13.609> is<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.790> thing<00:03:13.970> I've<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.510> think<00:03:14.959> I've

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
this is the thing I've I think I've

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.650 
this is the thing I've I think I've
played<00:03:15.320> probably<00:03:15.799> 20<00:03:16.100> times<00:03:16.400> since<00:03:16.640> Monday<00:03:17.090> is

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
played probably 20 times since Monday is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.610 
played probably 20 times since Monday is
you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:17.959> actually<00:03:18.200> take<00:03:18.799> your<00:03:19.600> Duke<00:03:20.600> set<00:03:20.959> yeah

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
you can actually take your Duke set yeah

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
you can actually take your Duke set yeah
well<00:03:22.069> if<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.280> had<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.519> Duke<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.120> know<00:03:23.239> and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
well if I had the Duke but you know and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.900 
well if I had the Duke but you know and
actually<00:03:24.170> play<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.620> straight<00:03:25.130> up<00:03:25.340> against<00:03:25.819> the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
actually play it straight up against the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.360 
actually play it straight up against the
RL<00:03:26.180> as<00:03:26.299> well<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.650> RL<00:03:27.950> will<00:03:28.160> be<00:03:28.340> a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
RL as well so the RL will be a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.090 
RL as well so the RL will be a
standalone<00:03:28.970> box<00:03:29.390> with<00:03:29.840> two<00:03:30.140> sets<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.680> tiles

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
standalone box with two sets of tiles

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.400 
standalone box with two sets of tiles
light<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.489> dark<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.870> Duke<00:03:33.049> okay

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
light and dark just like the Duke okay

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.229 
light and dark just like the Duke okay
but<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.130> also<00:03:34.280> whether<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.970> want<00:03:35.150> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
but you can also whether you want to

still being developed now still in
progress<00:04:55.130> still<00:04:55.610> in<00:04:55.760> progress<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.480> idea

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
progress still in progress but the idea

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.240 
progress still in progress but the idea
here<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:57.260> we're<00:04:57.530> going<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.680> be<00:04:57.800> coming<00:04:58.040> out

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
here is we're going to be coming out

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.970 
here is we're going to be coming out
with<00:04:58.420> reinforcements<00:04:59.420> packs<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:00.770> would

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
with reinforcements packs so this would

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.360 
with reinforcements packs so this would
be<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.780> reinforcements<00:05:02.780> city<00:05:03.170> pack<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:04.220> would

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
be a reinforcements city pack that would

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.370 
be a reinforcements city pack that would
have<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.910> number<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.330> tiles<00:05:05.810> but<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.170> light

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
have this number of tiles but in light

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.900 
have this number of tiles but in light
and<00:05:06.620> dark<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.220> pack<00:05:07.400> would<00:05:07.580> actually<00:05:07.820> have

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
and dark so the pack would actually have

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.740 
and dark so the pack would actually have
12<00:05:08.210> tiles

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
12 tiles

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.050 
12 tiles
okay<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.500> then<00:05:09.770> there'll<00:05:09.950> be<00:05:09.980> two<00:05:10.100> packs<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.790> 12

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
okay so then there'll be two packs of 12

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.120
