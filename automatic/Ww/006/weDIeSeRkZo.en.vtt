an all-around fascinating guy here we
have<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> portrait<00:00:28.290> of<00:00:28.410> him<00:00:28.649> what<00:00:29.309> I<00:00:29.340> want<00:00:29.520> to

have this portrait of him what I want to

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.089 
have this portrait of him what I want to
do<00:00:29.759> is<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.180> improve<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.899> portrait<00:00:31.470> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
do is I want to improve this portrait so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.530 
do is I want to improve this portrait so
the<00:00:32.220> first<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.270> is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the first thing that I'm going to do is

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.169 
the first thing that I'm going to do is
navigate<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.739> basic<00:00:35.039> panel<00:00:35.519> I'm<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.179 
navigate to my basic panel I'm going to

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.330 
navigate to my basic panel I'm going to
start<00:00:36.449> at<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.660> top<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.260> make<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:37.829> way<00:00:38.039> down

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
start at the top and make my way down

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.639 
start at the top and make my way down
and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.059> maybe<00:00:39.269> bounce<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.929> up<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> top

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and then maybe bounce back up to the top

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.099 
and then maybe bounce back up to the top
again<00:00:40.859> so<00:00:41.820> let's<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.300> ahead<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.539> crease<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
again so let's go ahead and crease the

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.660 
again so let's go ahead and crease the
color<00:00:43.289> temperature<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.519> be<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
color temperature this is going to be a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.970 
color temperature this is going to be a
subjective<00:00:44.969> edit<00:00:45.809> simply<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.679> want

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
subjective edit simply because I want

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
subjective edit simply because I want
this<00:00:47.190> image<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.179> bit<00:00:48.329> more<00:00:48.629> warm

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
this image to be a little bit more warm

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.099 
this image to be a little bit more warm
next<00:00:49.980> I'll<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.460> down<00:00:50.609> to<00:00:50.640> exposure<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.539> simply

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
next I'll go down to exposure and simply

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.049 
next I'll go down to exposure and simply
click<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.469> drag<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.460> I'm

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
click and drag that up a little bit I'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
click and drag that up a little bit I'm
going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> add<00:00:54.359> some<00:00:54.690> fill<00:00:55.019> light<00:00:55.260> here

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
going to add some fill light here

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
going to add some fill light here
perhaps<00:00:55.859> increase<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.640> blacks<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.359> then<00:00:57.809> also

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
perhaps increase my blacks and then also

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.130 
perhaps increase my blacks and then also
a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.379> bit<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.559> contrast<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> brightness

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
a little bit of contrast and brightness

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
a little bit of contrast and brightness
now<00:01:01.140> whenever<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.739> start<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.370> affect<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
now whenever we start to affect the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
now whenever we start to affect the
image<00:01:03.269> with<00:01:03.839> its<00:01:03.870> tone<00:01:04.320> let's<00:01:04.589> say<00:01:04.769> blacks<00:01:05.129> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
image with its tone let's say blacks or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.600 
image with its tone let's say blacks or
contrast<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.259> turn<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> affect

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
contrast that in turn is going to affect

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
contrast that in turn is going to affect
the<00:01:08.759> color<00:01:09.000> saturation<00:01:09.329> for<00:01:10.290> example<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.979> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the color saturation for example if we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
the color saturation for example if we
have<00:01:11.369> our<00:01:11.490> blacks<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.329> high<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.600> can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have our blacks up really high you can

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
have our blacks up really high you can
see<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.770> color<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.430> has<00:01:14.549> been

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
see that the color here has been

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
see that the color here has been
affected<00:01:15.329> dramatically<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
affected dramatically so one of the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
affected dramatically so one of the
things<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.579> need<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> keep<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.210> mind<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
things that you need to keep in mind is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.380 
things that you need to keep in mind is
as<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.439> through<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:19.860> controls<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:21.180> may

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
as you go through these controls you may

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.789 
as you go through these controls you may
need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.259> temperature

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
need to go back to your temperature

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
need to go back to your temperature
control<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.460> may<00:01:23.909> need<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> change<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
control you may need to change it a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
control you may need to change it a
little<00:01:24.899> bit<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.649> case<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.460> went<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
little bit in my case I think I went a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
little bit in my case I think I went a
little<00:01:26.850> too<00:01:27.000> far<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> warming<00:01:28.649> up<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
little too far with the warming up of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
little too far with the warming up of
the<00:01:29.310> photograph<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.659> well<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.079> far<00:01:31.289> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the photograph all right well so far so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.889 
the photograph all right well so far so
good<00:01:31.560> let's<00:01:32.280> continue<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.969> down<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
good let's continue on down in the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.539 
good let's continue on down in the
clarity<00:01:34.320> slider<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> add<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> little

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
clarity slider here we can add a little

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
clarity slider here we can add a little
bit<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> mid-tone<00:01:36.030> contrast<00:01:36.829> typically<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
bit of mid-tone contrast typically you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.580 
bit of mid-tone contrast typically you
want<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.520> add<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:39.060> touch<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.539> that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
want to add just a touch of that

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
here is that while my depth of field is

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.370 
here is that while my depth of field is
really<00:03:47.220> really<00:03:47.430> shallow<00:03:47.880> one<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.960> the<00:03:49.020> eyes<00:03:49.140> is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
really really shallow one of the eyes is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.260 
really really shallow one of the eyes is
sharp<00:03:49.710> but<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> other<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.370> isn't<00:03:50.700> quite

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
sharp but the other one isn't quite

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.450 
sharp but the other one isn't quite
sharp<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.320> oh<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.440> increase<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.340> overall

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
sharp so oh and increase the overall

sharp so oh and increase the overall
sharpening<00:03:54.420> amount<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.320> I'll<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.890> clicking

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
sharpening amount so I'll do so clicking

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.270 
sharpening amount so I'll do so clicking
and<00:03:56.790> dragging<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:57.300> up<00:03:57.510> radius<00:03:58.500> typically

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and dragging this up radius typically

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
and dragging this up radius typically
you<00:03:59.430> want<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.700> pretty<00:03:59.940> low<00:04:00.210> radius<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.900> then

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
you want a pretty low radius and then

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.730 
you want a pretty low radius and then
detail<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.840> pretty<00:04:04.200> low<00:04:04.470> for

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
detail you can have that pretty low for

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.270 
detail you can have that pretty low for
not<00:04:05.730> sharpening<00:04:06.300> small<00:04:06.600> details<00:04:06.990> high<00:04:07.710> if<00:04:08.100> you

a little bit more and try to get this
image<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.940> better<00:04:21.270> place

all<00:04:22.170> right<00:04:22.320> great<00:04:22.530> well<00:04:23.220> now<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.610> I've<00:04:23.700> done

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
all right great well now that I've done

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.880 
all right great well now that I've done
all<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.180> I'm<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.169> zoom<00:04:25.410> out<00:04:25.590> by

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
all that I'm going to zoom out by

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.580 
all that I'm going to zoom out by
double-clicking<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:27.030> hand<00:04:27.630> tool

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
double-clicking the hand tool

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.940 
double-clicking the hand tool
that<00:04:28.770> will<00:04:28.920> take<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.310> view<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> fit<00:04:30.630> in

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
that will take this view to a fit in

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.680 
that will take this view to a fit in
View<00:04:31.950> mode<00:04:32.130> great<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.030> think<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.300> image<00:04:33.570> is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
View mode great I think the image is

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.870 
View mode great I think the image is
looking<00:04:34.110> better<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.590> let's<00:04:35.130> say<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.730> I've

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
looking better but let's say that I've

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.580 
looking better but let's say that I've
decided<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.600> want<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.020> get<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.170> little<00:04:37.440> bit

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
decided I want to get a little bit

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.920 
decided I want to get a little bit
creative<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.490> want<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.880> change<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.540> color<00:04:39.810> and

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
tone well how could I do that well we

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.200 
tone well how could I do that well we
could<00:04:42.420> go<00:04:42.570> back<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.050> basic<00:04:43.500> panel<00:04:43.740> or<00:04:44.340> we

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
could go back to the basic panel or we

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.120 
could go back to the basic panel or we
could<00:04:45.390> go<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.570> another<00:04:45.870> panel<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.920> want<00:04:46.950> to

could go to another panel and I want to

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.040 
could go to another panel and I want to
highlight<00:04:47.340> this<00:04:47.670> one<00:04:47.730> here<00:04:48.240> just<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.750> show<00:04:48.990> you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
that there are other options and I go to

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.660 
that there are other options and I go to
split<00:04:52.110> toning<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.650> here<00:04:53.280> I'm<00:04:53.340> going<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.490> add

split toning and here I'm going to add

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.280 
split toning and here I'm going to add
maybe<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.090> little<00:04:54.360> bit<00:04:54.480> of<00:04:54.570> yellow<00:04:54.930> in<00:04:55.110> my

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
maybe a little bit of yellow in my

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.930 
maybe a little bit of yellow in my
highlights<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.070> then<00:04:56.160> perhaps<00:04:56.550> maybe<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
highlights and then perhaps maybe a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.330 
highlights and then perhaps maybe a
little<00:04:57.090> bit<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.360> blue<00:04:57.600> in<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:57.990> shadows<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:59.310> can

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
little bit of blue in my shadows you can

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.550 
little bit of blue in my shadows you can
see<00:04:59.670> that<00:04:59.820> I'm<00:04:59.910> modifying<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.660> overall<00:05:01.200> look

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
see that I'm modifying the overall look

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.010 
see that I'm modifying the overall look
of<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.920> photograph<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.670> having<00:05:03.570> some<00:05:03.780> fun

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
with this image now once I made those

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.050 
with this image now once I made those
changes<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.800> almost<00:05:08.040> always<00:05:08.370> want<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.940> go

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
changes you almost always want to go

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.150 
changes you almost always want to go
back<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.570> your<00:05:09.690> basic<00:05:09.900> control<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.740> then<00:05:10.950> make

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
back to your basic control and then make

further<00:05:11.520> changes<00:05:11.640> in<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.300> case<00:05:12.540> I'm<00:05:12.690> going

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
further changes in this case I'm going

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.360 
further changes in this case I'm going
to<00:05:12.840> brighten<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.260> up<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.590> little<00:05:13.680> bit<00:05:13.950> more<00:05:14.160> a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
to brighten it up a little bit more a

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.910 
to brighten it up a little bit more a
little<00:05:14.400> more<00:05:15.090> contrast<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.560> perhaps

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
little more contrast and then perhaps

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.710 
little more contrast and then perhaps
change<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.430> color<00:05:17.670> temperature<00:05:17.940> just<00:05:18.600> a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
change the color temperature just a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.140 
change the color temperature just a
touch<00:05:18.960> as<00:05:19.230> well<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.190> they<00:05:20.340> have<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.730> really

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
