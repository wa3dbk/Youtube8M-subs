00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.550 
the video said and they were adding new
bones

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.250 

and<00:02:14.240> then<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.450> were<00:02:15.510> trying<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> figure<00:02:16.080> out

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and then they were trying to figure out

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.870 
and then they were trying to figure out
well<00:02:16.470> why<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.340> these<00:02:17.460> bones<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
well why don't have all these bones and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.160 
well why don't have all these bones and
they're<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.090> related<00:02:18.510> these<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.780> actually

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
they're not related these are actually

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.070 
they're not related these are actually
if<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.860> add<00:02:20.070> different<00:02:20.700> bones<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.240> object

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
if you add different bones in object

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
if you add different bones in object
mode<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:23.700> I'll<00:02:23.820> add<00:02:24.030> another<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.740> okay<00:02:25.740> these

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
mode or I'll add another one okay these

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.490 
mode or I'll add another one okay these
are<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:26.310> entirely<00:02:27.150> separate<00:02:27.750> armatures<00:02:28.260> for

entirely separate you know skeletons all

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.620 
entirely separate you know skeletons all
right

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
right

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.660 
right
these<00:02:34.020> are<00:02:34.170> entirely<00:02:34.440> separate<00:02:34.920> objects<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
these are entirely separate objects you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.330 
these are entirely separate objects you
can<00:02:35.940> join<00:02:36.240> them<00:02:36.480> together<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
can join them together you can get a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.820 
can join them together you can get a
couple<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:38.730> guys<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:40.380> controlled

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
couple of these guys and it controlled

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.530 
couple of these guys and it controlled
GA<00:02:41.870> join<00:02:42.870> them<00:02:43.610> all<00:02:44.610> right<00:02:44.730> now<00:02:44.760> now<00:02:45.240> they're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
GA join them all right now now they're

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.950 
GA join them all right now now they're
part<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.080> same<00:02:46.290> object<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.180> know

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
part of the same object but you know

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.990 
part of the same object but you know
your<00:02:49.110> best<00:02:49.290> bet<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.890> definitely<00:02:50.730> let<00:02:50.970> me

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
your best bet is definitely let me

your best bet is definitely let me
delete<00:02:51.870> these<00:02:52.520> your<00:02:53.520> best<00:02:53.790> bet<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.270> add<00:02:54.810> one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
delete these your best bet is to add one

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:06.590 
delete these your best bet is to add one
bone<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:57.380> then<00:02:58.380> go<00:02:59.160> into<00:02:59.480> edit<00:03:00.480> mode<00:03:05.390> okay<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
bone and then go into edit mode okay and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.110 
bone and then go into edit mode okay and
then<00:03:06.900> start<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.950> example<00:03:08.040> extruding<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
then start for example extruding and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.270 
then start for example extruding and
duplicating<00:03:12.120> your<00:03:12.960> bones<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.800> moving<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
duplicating your bones and moving the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.110 
duplicating your bones and moving the
joints<00:03:14.670> into<00:03:15.420> place

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
joints into place

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.820 
joints into place
fixing<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.240> bone<00:03:18.390> role<00:03:18.630> rotations<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.590> then

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
fixing the bone role rotations and then

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.590 
fixing the bone role rotations and then
you<00:03:20.040> may<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.459> renaming<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.360> although

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
you may be renaming them you although

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.080 
you may be renaming them you although
you<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.840> rename<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.200> bones<00:03:22.380> at<00:03:22.530> any<00:03:22.650> point

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you can rename the bones at any point

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030 
you can rename the bones at any point
all<00:03:24.090> right<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.360> that's<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.750> purpose<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
all right so that's the purpose of the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.730 
all right so that's the purpose of the
the<00:03:26.520> edit<00:03:26.760> mode<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.480> actually<00:03:27.840> edit<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
the edit mode is to actually edit the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.449 
the edit mode is to actually edit the
skeleton<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.490> add<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.450> create<00:03:30.570> bones<00:03:30.930> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
skeleton and add and create bones and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.920 
skeleton and add and create bones and
you<00:03:32.459> want<00:03:32.640> them<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:32.940> all<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.390> bones<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.810> be

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
you want them all all the bones to be

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.790 
you want them all all the bones to be
part<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.440> one<00:03:34.680> armature<00:03:35.160> all<00:03:35.520> right

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
part of one armature all right

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.190 
part of one armature all right
so<00:03:37.800> we'll<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.630> again

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
so we'll go back to this the and again

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.479 
so we'll go back to this the and again
the<00:03:40.320> final<00:03:40.500> thing<00:03:40.770> once<00:03:41.100> you've<00:03:41.250> edited

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the final thing once you've edited

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.360 
the final thing once you've edited
everything<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.650> parented<00:03:43.650> your<00:03:43.800> mesh<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.220> it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
everything and parented your mesh to it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.729 
everything and parented your mesh to it
and<00:03:44.580> start<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.000> pain<00:03:45.180> your<00:03:45.360> weights<00:03:45.540> then<00:03:46.350> when

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
and start to pain your weights then when

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.830 
and start to pain your weights then when
you're<00:03:46.860> finally<00:03:47.130> ready<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:48.390> into<00:03:48.600> pose

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you're finally ready to go go into pose

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.280 
you're finally ready to go go into pose
mode<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.670> pose<00:03:50.670> mode<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.270> where<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.959> actually

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mode and pose mode is where you actually

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.520 
mode and pose mode is where you actually
can<00:03:53.070> rotate<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.610> bones<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.180> animate<00:03:55.110> them<00:03:55.290> as

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
can rotate the bones and animate them as

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.990 
can rotate the bones and animate them as
you<00:03:55.650> can<00:03:55.770> see<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> mesh<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:56.489> moving<00:03:56.760> with

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
you can see the mesh is now moving with

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.850 
you can see the mesh is now moving with
it<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.750> I'm<00:03:58.020> in<00:03:58.610> edit<00:03:59.610> mode<00:04:00.440> you'll<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.530> that

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it if I'm in edit mode you'll see that

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.600 
it if I'm in edit mode you'll see that
the<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:03.570> results<00:04:03.900> are<00:04:04.020> different<00:04:04.430> okay<00:04:05.430> it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the the results are different okay it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.729 
the the results are different okay it
has<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.970> be<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.209> way<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:06.630> order<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.590> to

has to be this way in order for you to

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.479 
has to be this way in order for you to
be<00:04:07.860> able<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.160> add<00:04:08.640> objects<00:04:09.980> edit<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> objects

it's<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.900> blender<00:04:35.229> smart<00:04:35.500> enough<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.710> know<00:04:35.949> that

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
it's a blender smart enough to know that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.029 
it's a blender smart enough to know that
you<00:04:38.020> know<00:04:38.110> when<00:04:38.259> we're<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.530> certain<00:04:38.830> modes

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
pose mode yeah this the other thing to

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.240 
pose mode yeah this the other thing to
note<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:48.940> blender<00:04:49.810> remembers<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.919> state

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
note is that blender remembers the state

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.060 
note is that blender remembers the state
of<00:04:51.430> each<00:04:51.940> armature<00:04:52.509> separately<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.350> this

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
of each armature separately so this

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.460 
of each armature separately so this
armature<00:04:54.400> controlling<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.030> man<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.570> in<00:04:56.229> pose

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
armature controlling the man is in pose

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.279 
armature controlling the man is in pose
mode<00:04:56.500> okay<00:04:57.310> it's<00:04:57.430> ready<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.699> be<00:04:57.850> animated<00:04:58.419> this

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
mode okay it's ready to be animated this

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.580 
mode okay it's ready to be animated this
armature<00:04:59.650> we<00:05:00.039> were<00:05:00.160> working<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.550> before<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:01.590> in

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
armature we were working on before is in

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.480 
armature we were working on before is in
object<00:05:03.340> mode<00:05:03.780> okay<00:05:04.780> so<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:06.010> object<00:05:06.370> mode

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
object mode okay so in the object mode

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.890 
object mode okay so in the object mode
all<00:05:06.699> you<00:05:06.729> can<00:05:07.030> do<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.330> move<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.660> entire

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
all you can do is move the entire

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.620 
all you can do is move the entire
armature<00:05:08.380> around<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:09.090> 3d<00:05:10.090> space<00:05:10.919> alright<00:05:11.919> and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
armature around in 3d space alright and

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.939 
armature around in 3d space alright and
as<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.750> can<00:05:13.810> see<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.229> options<00:05:14.680> are<00:05:14.800> different

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
as you can see the options are different

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.640 
as you can see the options are different
here<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.430> it's<00:05:16.090> easy<00:05:16.479> sometimes<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:17.289> get

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
here so it's easy sometimes to get

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.680 
here so it's easy sometimes to get
confused<00:05:18.099> because<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:19.060> switch<00:05:19.330> through<00:05:19.570> this

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
confused because you switch through this

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.719 
confused because you switch through this
one<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.050> pose<00:05:20.229> mode<00:05:20.310> now<00:05:21.310> you're<00:05:21.460> ready<00:05:21.639> to

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
one in pose mode now you're ready to

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.249 
one in pose mode now you're ready to
animate<00:05:22.030> this<00:05:22.300> one<00:05:22.449> over<00:05:22.660> here<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.110> this

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
animate this one over here and this

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.469 
animate this one over here and this
one's<00:05:23.470> in<00:05:23.590> object<00:05:23.949> mode<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.370> maybe<00:05:25.240> if<00:05:25.360> you're

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
one's in object mode and maybe if you're

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.810 
one's in object mode and maybe if you're
not<00:05:25.570> familiar<00:05:25.750> with<00:05:26.020> blender<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:27.370> options

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
not familiar with blender the options

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.070 
not familiar with blender the options
change<00:05:28.090> down<00:05:28.360> here<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:28.780> get<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.930> little

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
change down here and you get a little

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.890 
change down here and you get a little
bit<00:05:29.139> confused<00:05:29.560> okay<00:05:29.979> just<00:05:30.280> remember<00:05:30.539> that<00:05:31.539> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
bit confused okay just remember that the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.360 
bit confused okay just remember that the
modes<00:05:32.110> are<00:05:32.260> different<00:05:32.560> for<00:05:32.680> each<00:05:32.710> skeleton

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
modes are different for each skeleton

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.700 
modes are different for each skeleton
which<00:05:34.120> can<00:05:34.419> be<00:05:34.510> very<00:05:34.690> handy<00:05:34.900> in<00:05:35.289> in<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.590> way

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
which can be very handy in in a way

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.939 
which can be very handy in in a way
because<00:05:36.900> well<00:05:37.900> you<00:05:38.080> know<00:05:38.169> each<00:05:38.349> one<00:05:38.590> has<00:05:38.770> its

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
because well you know each one has its

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.890 
because well you know each one has its
own<00:05:39.039> little<00:05:39.400> space<00:05:39.940> available<00:05:40.419> to<00:05:40.539> it

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
own little space available to it

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.430 
own little space available to it
alright<00:05:41.889> so<00:05:42.539> that's<00:05:43.539> the<00:05:43.810> main<00:05:43.960> thing<00:05:44.260> um
