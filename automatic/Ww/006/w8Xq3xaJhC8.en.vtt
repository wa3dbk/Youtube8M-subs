off the list of achievements but

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.950 
off the list of achievements but
actually<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.730> depth<00:00:18.029> using<00:00:18.390> reasonable

explanations and breakdowns because

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
explanations and breakdowns because
that's<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.060> should<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> do<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.810> my

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
that's what I should have to do here my

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.859 
that's what I should have to do here my
channel<00:00:22.289> produce<00:00:23.010> quality<00:00:23.400> content<00:00:24.150> so

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
channel produce quality content so

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
channel produce quality content so
without<00:00:25.080> further<00:00:25.260> ado<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.580> most

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
without further ado the first and most

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.029 
without further ado the first and most
likely<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.480> main<00:00:27.750> objective<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.560> easter<00:00:28.949> egg

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
likely the main objective or easter egg

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.759 
likely the main objective or easter egg
that<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.730> officially<00:00:30.630> end<00:00:30.900> zombies<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that will officially end zombies is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
little lost girl release Samantha so we

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
little lost girl release Samantha so we
all<00:00:35.460> remember<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.360> moon<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
all remember back from moon that we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 
all remember back from moon that we
didn't<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.829> release<00:00:38.489> Samantha<00:00:39.090> from

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
didn't actually release Samantha from

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.900 
didn't actually release Samantha from
the<00:00:39.360> MPD<00:00:39.750> her<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> richtofen<00:00:41.160> only<00:00:41.610> switched

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the MPD her and richtofen only switched

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
the MPD her and richtofen only switched
bodies<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.660> after<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> she<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.980> trapped<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
bodies and after that she was trapped in

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.750 
bodies and after that she was trapped in
the<00:00:45.059> ether<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.980> Max's<00:00:47.309> dialogue

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the ether I think so for Max's dialogue

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.810 
the ether I think so for Max's dialogue
in<00:00:48.030> buried<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.550> will

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
in buried we know this so now this will

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.279 
in buried we know this so now this will
have<00:00:51.000> something<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> giant

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
have something to do with the giant

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
have something to do with the giant
robot<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.160> previously<00:00:53.399> explained<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
robot and as I previously explained in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
robot and as I previously explained in
my<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.930> interference<00:00:55.530> theory<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
my time interference theory which you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
my time interference theory which you
guys<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.340> check<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.270> messed<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
guys can check out time is messed up and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
guys can check out time is messed up and
the<00:00:58.050> whole<00:00:58.230> storyline<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> loop<00:00:59.550> causing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the whole storyline is in a loop causing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170 
the whole storyline is in a loop causing
a<00:01:00.420> disruption<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.170> events<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.190> Samantha

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
a disruption of events because Samantha

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
a disruption of events because Samantha
wasn't<00:01:03.329> even<00:01:03.629> born<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.260> place<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
wasn't even born in the first place and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
wasn't even born in the first place and
now<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> map<00:01:05.970> she<00:01:06.330> acts<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> narrator

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
now in the map she acts as a narrator

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
now in the map she acts as a narrator
because<00:01:07.710> she<00:01:07.920> knew<00:01:08.100> exactly<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.760> happened

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
because she knew exactly what happened

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.500 
because she knew exactly what happened
so<00:01:09.390> that'll<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.439> interesting<00:01:11.420> next<00:01:12.420> we

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so that'll be pretty interesting next we

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
so that'll be pretty interesting next we
have<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> gold<00:01:13.229> digger<00:01:13.290> share<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> weapon

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
have not a gold digger share a weapon

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
have not a gold digger share a weapon
you<00:01:15.000> dug<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.740> now<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.220> reminds<00:01:17.820> me

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you dug up now this actually reminds me

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.149 
you dug up now this actually reminds me
of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> world<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.720> war<00:01:18.900> version<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> ipod

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
of the world at war version for the ipod

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
of the world at war version for the ipod
where<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.670> had<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> grab<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> shovel<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> dig

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
where you had to grab a shovel and dig

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.010 
where you had to grab a shovel and dig
up<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.369> wonder<00:01:23.640> waffle<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
up like the wonder waffle like in this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
up like the wonder waffle like in this
image<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.860> likely<00:01:26.009> something<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
image so most likely something like this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
image so most likely something like this
and<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> lot<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.560> parts<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and there's a lot of different parts of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
and there's a lot of different parts of
the<00:01:29.460> map<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.750> like

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the map here and it could be just like

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.310 
the map here and it could be just like
scattered<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.570> fact<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
scattered so I do know for a fact it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
scattered so I do know for a fact it
would<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.369> near<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> memorial<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
would probably be near the memorial and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.580 
would probably be near the memorial and
cemetery<00:01:37.430> because<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.820> late<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.930> view<00:01:40.170> does

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
cemetery because I'm late on view does

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
cemetery because I'm late on view does
place<00:01:40.890> does<00:01:41.579> take<00:01:41.820> place<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.450> done<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
place does take place and we're done and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
place does take place and we're done and
there's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.500> loads<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> loads<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.340> grave

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
there's just loads and loads of grave

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
there's just loads and loads of grave
Sam<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.840> next<00:01:46.049> achievement<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.619> all<00:01:46.950> your

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
Sam the next achievement is all your

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
Sam the next achievement is all your
base<00:01:47.280> activate<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.090> generators<00:01:48.540> without

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
base activate all generators without

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
base activate all generators without
allowing<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.530> stop<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
allowing one to stop and I think one of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
allowing one to stop and I think one of
the<00:01:51.270> generators<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the generators is right here from the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
the generators is right here from the
trailer<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.390> before<00:01:54.780> Jenna

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
trailer and I think there before Jenna

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
trailer and I think there before Jenna
raised<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> pump<00:01:55.860> stations<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.399> saw<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
raised at the pump stations we saw and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149 
raised at the pump stations we saw and
each<00:01:57.119> player<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.600> activate<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.860> guard

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
each player has that activate and guard

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
each player has that activate and guard
them<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> same<00:02:01.110> time<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
them at the at the same time for this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.010 
them at the at the same time for this
and<00:02:01.860> maybe<00:02:02.130> it'll<00:02:02.520> even<00:02:02.759> open<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.479> new<00:02:03.509> part

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and maybe it'll even open up a new part

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.770 
and maybe it'll even open up a new part
of<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> map<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.520> kung<00:02:05.790> fu<00:02:05.969> grip<00:02:06.149> for

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
of the map next we have kung fu grip for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
of the map next we have kung fu grip for
yourself<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> another<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> panzer<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
yourself and another from the panzer so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.470 
yourself and another from the panzer so
let's<00:02:09.530> call<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:10.920> game<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
let's call in one game and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.270 
let's call in one game and
I believe<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.319> referring<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.010> Metal

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
I believe this is referring to the Metal

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.670 
I believe this is referring to the Metal
Men<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.819> all<00:02:14.909> probably<00:02:15.120> forgot<00:02:15.569> about<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
Men we all probably forgot about and I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.309 
Men we all probably forgot about and I
think<00:02:17.099> we'll<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:18.390> able<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.629> knife<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
think we'll just be able to knife the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.869 
think we'll just be able to knife the
metal<00:02:19.590> men's<00:02:19.739> claws<00:02:20.069> away<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.700> did<00:02:20.849> for

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
metal men's claws away like we did for

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.089 
metal men's claws away like we did for
the<00:02:21.030> denison<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.629> get<00:02:21.780> them<00:02:21.930> off<00:02:22.080> us<00:02:22.290> next<00:02:23.010> we

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the denison to get them off us next we

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.440 
the denison to get them off us next we
have<00:02:23.159> playing<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.610> power<00:02:23.790> build<00:02:24.239> all

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
have playing with power build all

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
have playing with power build all
elemental<00:02:25.049> staffs<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.620> one<00:02:25.830> game<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.340> yes<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
elemental staffs in one game and yes the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
elemental staffs in one game and yes the
new<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.989> weapon<00:02:28.409> for<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.830> map<00:02:29.099> will<00:02:29.340> indeed

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
new one weapon for this map will indeed

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.960 
new one weapon for this map will indeed
be<00:02:30.269> an<00:02:30.510> elemental<00:02:31.230> staff<00:02:31.560> or<00:02:31.860> actually<00:02:32.549> staves

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
be an elemental staff or actually staves

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.000 
be an elemental staff or actually staves
because<00:02:33.420> there<00:02:33.569> will<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:33.930> some<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.590> think

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
because there will be about some I think

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.059 
because there will be about some I think
for<00:02:35.459> staffs<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:36.180> each<00:02:36.330> element<00:02:36.569> such<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.590> fire

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
for staffs of each element such as fire

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.559 
for staffs of each element such as fire
that<00:02:38.340> allows<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.730> unite<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.180> zombies

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
that allows you to unite the zombies

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.990 
that allows you to unite the zombies
when<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.319> blows<00:02:40.560> them<00:02:40.769> away<00:02:40.829> I<00:02:41.310> stop<00:02:41.640> freezes

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
when that blows them away I stop freezes

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.270 
when that blows them away I stop freezes
them<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.360> electricity<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.590> zaps<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
them and electricity that zaps and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.520 
them and electricity that zaps and
that's<00:02:44.430> what<00:02:44.549> I'm<00:02:44.640> thinking<00:02:44.670> it'll<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.540> so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that's what I'm thinking it'll be so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.400 
that's what I'm thinking it'll be so
next<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.890> I'm<00:02:47.099> I'm<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.879> tank<00:02:48.239> ride<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.140> tank

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
next is I'm I'm on a tank ride the tank

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.440 
next is I'm I'm on a tank ride the tank
around<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.890> map<00:02:50.040> without<00:02:50.190> getting<00:02:50.609> off<00:02:50.790> so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
around the map without getting off so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
around the map without getting off so
that<00:02:51.480> one<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:51.959> pretty<00:02:52.200> self-explanatory<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that one is pretty self-explanatory and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.369 
that one is pretty self-explanatory and
the<00:02:53.459> tank<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.910> basically<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.780> bus<00:02:55.170> from

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
the tank is basically like the bus from

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.440 
the tank is basically like the bus from
transit<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.370> probably<00:02:56.670> harder<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.150> defend

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
transit but probably harder to defend

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.630 
transit but probably harder to defend
from<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> lack<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:57.989> windows<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.160> new<00:02:59.340> Metal

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
from the lack of windows the new Metal

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.339 
from the lack of windows the new Metal
Men<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.940> giant<00:03:00.209> robot<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.900> might<00:03:01.140> be<00:03:01.319> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
Men in giant robot so this might be a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.710 
Men in giant robot so this might be a
little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.890> challenging<00:03:02.430> next<00:03:03.299> is<00:03:03.390> saving

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
little bit challenging next is saving

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.009 
little bit challenging next is saving
the<00:03:03.810> day<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.200> day<00:03:05.239> revive<00:03:06.239> another<00:03:06.690> player

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the day all day revive another player

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.890 
the day all day revive another player
four<00:03:07.560> different<00:03:08.010> ways<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.700> game<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
four different ways in one game so the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.319 
four different ways in one game so the
first<00:03:10.109> method<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.709> know<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.190> by<00:03:11.819> directly

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
first method we know is by directly

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.390 
first method we know is by directly
reviving<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.049> person<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.950> second<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
reviving a person and the second is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.640 
reviving a person and the second is
actually<00:03:14.879> build<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.359> next<00:03:15.750> trophy<00:03:16.140> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
actually build in the next trophy and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530 
actually build in the next trophy and
the<00:03:16.739> third<00:03:16.950> way<00:03:17.130> could<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.519> from<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.000> perk<00:03:18.239> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
the third way could be from a perk and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
the third way could be from a perk and
the<00:03:18.690> fourth<00:03:18.959> way<00:03:19.139> from<00:03:19.680> one<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
the fourth way from one of the like the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.330 
the fourth way from one of the like the
stays<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.239> them<00:03:21.450> combined<00:03:22.250> next<00:03:23.250> is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
stays or all of them combined next is

master of disguise use zombie blood to
revive<00:03:25.440> three<00:03:25.709> players<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.340> activate<00:03:26.700> a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
revive three players and activate a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.970 
revive three players and activate a
generator<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.660> game<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:28.859> assuming

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
generator in one game so I'm assuming

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.129 
generator in one game so I'm assuming
this<00:03:29.579> could<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.239> voter<00:03:30.480> ID<00:03:30.720> where<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:30.989> can

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
this could be like voter ID where we can

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.259 
this could be like voter ID where we can
mask<00:03:31.380> yourselves<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.700> says<00:03:32.880> master

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
mask yourselves because it says master

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.900 
mask yourselves because it says master
of<00:03:33.329> disguise<00:03:33.660> or<00:03:34.019> maybe<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:35.099> can<00:03:35.340> collect<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
of disguise or maybe we can collect it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.449 
of disguise or maybe we can collect it
and<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.480> generator<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.829> be<00:03:37.950> filled<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and the generator can be filled with the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.199 
and the generator can be filled with the
blood<00:03:39.560> next<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.650> overachiever<00:03:41.220> complete<00:03:42.030> all

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
blood next is overachiever complete all

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.870 
blood next is overachiever complete all
four<00:03:42.510> challenges<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.079> one<00:03:43.410> game<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.919> this<00:03:44.639> one

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
four challenges in one game and this one

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.220 
four challenges in one game and this one
I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.060> it'll<00:03:45.510> be<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.810> mob<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.169> dead

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
I think it'll be like mob of the dead

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.409 
I think it'll be like mob of the dead
where<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.650> hit<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.950> feed<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> dogs<00:03:47.549> get<00:03:48.299> the

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
where you hit like feed the dogs get the

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.780 
where you hit like feed the dogs get the
skulls<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.139> get<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.709> golden<00:03:50.040> spork<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
skulls and get like the golden spork and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
skulls and get like the golden spork and
here<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.329> origins<00:03:51.750> you'll<00:03:51.959> probably<00:03:52.169> have<00:03:52.440> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
here in origins you'll probably have to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.110 
here in origins you'll probably have to
dig<00:03:52.829> up<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.069> weapons<00:03:53.250> activate<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
dig up the weapons activate the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.849 
dig up the weapons activate the
generators<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.840> find<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.109> elemental<00:03:55.560> staves

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
generators and find the elemental staves

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.710 
generators and find the elemental staves
and<00:03:56.129> combine<00:03:56.489> them<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:57.239> form<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.690> ultimate

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
and combine them to form the ultimate

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440 
and combine them to form the ultimate
staff<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.680> now<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.669> last<00:03:59.879> achievement

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
staff for this now the last achievement

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.839 
staff for this now the last achievement
is<00:04:00.569> master<00:04:01.109> wizard<00:04:01.440> wield<00:04:02.010> all<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.459> ultimate

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
is master wizard wield all the ultimate

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.390 
is master wizard wield all the ultimate
staffs<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.389> one<00:04:03.540> game<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.560> guess<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:05.220> can

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
staffs in one game so I guess you can

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.610 
staffs in one game so I guess you can
but<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:06.150> combine<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:06.720> those<00:04:06.900> staves<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
but you can combine all those staves and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.559 
but you can combine all those staves and
just<00:04:08.400> like<00:04:08.489> pack<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> punch<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.449> this
