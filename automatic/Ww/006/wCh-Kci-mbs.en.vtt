00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
to us but at the same time they don't

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.050

then we give them our opinions and then

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.720 
then we give them our opinions and then
they're<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.090> oh<00:02:30.269> well<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.569> don't<00:02:30.720> care<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
you know but anyway that's just my

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.199 
you know but anyway that's just my
opinion<00:02:34.409> hopefully<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> nightmare<00:02:35.670> I'll<00:02:35.879> talk

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
opinion hopefully a nightmare I'll talk

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
opinion hopefully a nightmare I'll talk
to<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.420> soon<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.709> thank<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.549> very<00:02:38.700> much<00:02:38.909> for

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
to you soon and thank you very much for

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.050 
to you soon and thank you very much for
pointing<00:02:39.299> out<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.019> little<00:02:40.890> glitch<00:02:41.819> or

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
pointing out that little glitch or

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.180 
pointing out that little glitch or
whatever<00:02:42.359> was<00:02:42.659> that<00:02:43.290> gives<00:02:43.500> us<00:02:43.680> some<00:02:43.920> proof

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
whatever was that gives us some proof

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.020 
whatever was that gives us some proof
that<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:44.489> going<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.640> change<00:02:44.909> everything

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that they're going to change everything

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.410 
that they're going to change everything
and<00:02:48.769> because<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.859> think<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:50.790> they<00:02:51.209> change

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
and because I think that if they change

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.839 
and because I think that if they change
if<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:51.840> made<00:02:52.109> Dungeoneering<00:02:52.650> 120<00:02:53.129> like<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
if they made Dungeoneering 120 like you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.009 
if they made Dungeoneering 120 like you
said<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.359> like<00:02:54.480> having<00:02:54.690> everything

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
said they don't like having everything

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.479 
said they don't like having everything
they<00:02:55.590> don't<00:02:55.769> like<00:02:55.920> having<00:02:56.129> anything

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
they don't like having anything

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.860 
they don't like having anything
different<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.209> they're<00:02:57.359> probably<00:02:57.389> change

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
different so they're probably change

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.410 
different so they're probably change
everything<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.349> 120<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.359> said

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
everything to 120 so like I said

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.509 
everything to 120 so like I said
hopefully<00:03:00.780> I'll<00:03:00.989> talk<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.349> soon<00:03:01.519> thanks
