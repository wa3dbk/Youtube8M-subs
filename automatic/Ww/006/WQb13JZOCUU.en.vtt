00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
to create less drag it was time for Run

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.020 

but<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:36.900> problem<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> brakes<00:01:38.790> have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
but there was a problem the brakes have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
but there was a problem the brakes have
been<00:01:39.210> binding<00:01:39.540> causing<00:01:40.320> them<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> overheat

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
been binding causing them to overheat

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.610 
been binding causing them to overheat
and<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.700> slow<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.390> down<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.530> was

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
and so slow me down and there was

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.830 
and so slow me down and there was
another<00:01:43.979> issue<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.850> team<00:01:45.120> boffins<00:01:45.630> had

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
looked at the day's conditions and

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.450 
looked at the day's conditions and
calculated<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.810> hit<00:01:49.080> 200<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.100> one

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
calculated that to hit 200 on this one

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.910 
calculated that to hit 200 on this one
