00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.479
 and how to install the radio does not 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.370
 this car is not normal for 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.570
 install the radio because this cover 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.309
 not the same as the others you are going 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.719
 pull her out 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.599
 no use wishing to force it to end 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.349
 breaking it out that whole panel 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.980
 here o 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.020
 here you take this panel that without 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.800
 never spatulate screwdriver 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 put the spatula here long enough 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 careful not to break anything is there 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.010
 has alert button behind it has a 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.960
 White connector here has a beam 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.790
 here it 's kind of hard to pinch her 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.770
 they finally pressed one out and here 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.720
 inside you can notice that it is not 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.329
 a cap equal to the others 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.060
 it comes a plate that is fixed on the panel 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.980
 so if you go there he wants to take the 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.670
 philips here the aid of a key 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.670
 philips nÃ© 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 I took screw here across the other 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 screw 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.840
 here already left in the hole cover that are 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.810
 here is the thalatone where you are stuck 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.390
 the slit hole both sides here if not 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.539
 have two screws here two of each 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.090
 to place the radio if you are 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.520
 using a 2D handset will put it 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.709
 right on this plate here it will give 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.259
 right in this camp here 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.060
 there you will use a normal 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.219
 It's one day you're going to have to put a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.539
 braces that gap but put 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.899
 a slap hole here will only stay the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.110
 always remembering to put four 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.849
