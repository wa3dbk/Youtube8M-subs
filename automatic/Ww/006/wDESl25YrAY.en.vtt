again I'm gonna go over all that

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.530 
again I'm gonna go over all that
beautiful<00:03:06.049> goodness<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.879> next<00:03:08.150> thing<00:03:08.329> is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
beautiful goodness the next thing is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.869 
beautiful goodness the next thing is
storage<00:03:09.470> services<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.220> enables<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.849> to

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
storage services now enables you to

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.750 
storage services now enables you to
create<00:03:11.269> storage<00:03:11.889> QoS<00:03:12.889> if<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> don't<00:03:13.609> know

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
create storage QoS if you don't know

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.119 
create storage QoS if you don't know
what<00:03:13.939> QoS<00:03:14.629> stands<00:03:15.049> for<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.409> quality<00:03:15.980> of

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
what QoS stands for is quality of

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.689 
what QoS stands for is quality of
services<00:03:17.169> policies<00:03:18.169> on<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.590> scale<00:03:19.190> out<00:03:19.220> file

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
services policies on a scale out file

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.879 
services policies on a scale out file
server<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.299> assign<00:03:20.720> them<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.079> one<00:03:21.109> or<00:03:21.590> more

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
server and assign them to one or more

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.009 
server and assign them to one or more
virtual<00:03:22.220> disk<00:03:22.699> on<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.359> hyper-v<00:03:23.989> virtual

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
virtual disk on a hyper-v virtual

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.439 
virtual disk on a hyper-v virtual
machine<00:03:24.680> which<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.489> extremely<00:03:26.239> awesome

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
machine which that's extremely awesome

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:32.500 
machine which that's extremely awesome
so<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.470> can<00:03:27.650> actually<00:03:27.799> assign<00:03:31.060> more<00:03:32.060> virtual

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
so you can actually assign more virtual

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.030 
so you can actually assign more virtual
disks<00:03:32.720> into<00:03:32.870> your<00:03:33.079> hyper-v<00:03:33.470> without<00:03:33.739> shutting

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
disks into your hyper-v without shutting

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.220 
disks into your hyper-v without shutting
it<00:03:34.159> down<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.549> everything<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.299> seamless<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.019> I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
it down and everything is seamless so I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.170 
it down and everything is seamless so I
need<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.129> test<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.400> out

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
need to test that out

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.409 
need to test that out
the<00:03:38.480> next<00:03:38.750> one<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.049> functionality<00:03:39.949> of

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
the next one is functionality of

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.080 
the next one is functionality of
failover<00:03:41.419> clustering<00:03:42.669> hyper-v<00:03:43.669> or<00:03:43.819> scale

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
live file server failover cluster can

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.159 
live file server failover cluster can
now<00:03:46.400> easily<00:03:46.639> be<00:03:46.940> upgraded<00:03:47.510> without<00:03:47.930> any

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
and it took all that feedback in

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.719 
and it took all that feedback in
additive<00:06:45.319> in<00:06:45.439> Windows<00:06:45.770> 10<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.189> they're<00:06:46.490> still

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
additive in Windows 10 and they're still

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.999 
additive in Windows 10 and they're still
building<00:06:46.969> it<00:06:47.300> so<00:06:47.509> it's<00:06:47.719> pretty<00:06:47.960> awesome<00:06:48.080> again

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
I think this is the first build that

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.629 
I think this is the first build that
they<00:06:50.479> came<00:06:50.659> out<00:06:50.719> with<00:06:51.099> this<00:06:52.099> is<00:06:52.250> actually
