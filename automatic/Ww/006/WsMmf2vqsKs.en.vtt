if you don't put them as defense a

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.100 
if you don't put them as defense a
defense<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:15.030> know<00:06:15.120> cause<00:06:15.270> like<00:06:15.300> you<00:06:15.900> know<00:06:15.930> how

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
when you have a movie fans you'll be

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.360 
when you have a movie fans you'll be
coming<00:06:17.640> out<00:06:17.730> a<00:06:17.760> lot<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.240> know<00:06:18.380> so<00:06:19.380> you<00:06:20.190> know<00:06:20.310> if

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
coming out a lot you know so you know if

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.770 
coming out a lot you know so you know if
you<00:06:20.460> haven't<00:06:20.670> want<00:06:20.850> AG<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.330> only<00:06:21.570> come<00:06:21.750> out

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
you haven't want AG the only come out

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.860 
you haven't want AG the only come out
when<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.170> attack<00:06:22.530> so<00:06:22.920> I<00:06:23.310> think<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.270> best<00:06:24.450> idea

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
when you attack so I think the best idea

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.230 
when you attack so I think the best idea
just<00:06:25.140> to<00:06:25.320> Adam<00:06:25.950> as<00:06:26.130> a<00:06:26.160> tax<00:06:26.550> report<00:06:26.970> only

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
just to Adam as a tax report only

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.510 
just to Adam as a tax report only
because<00:06:27.720> they<00:06:27.960> don't<00:06:28.140> really<00:06:28.860> come<00:06:29.070> out<00:06:29.250> as

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
because they don't really come out as

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.120 
because they don't really come out as
often<00:06:29.910> as<00:06:30.300> like<00:06:30.660> a<00:06:30.690> defensive<00:06:31.410> board<00:06:31.650> for

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
often as like a defensive board for

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.900 
often as like a defensive board for
balance<00:06:32.580> of

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
balance of

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.300 
balance of
you<00:06:33.270> know<00:06:33.420> so<00:06:34.080> it's<00:06:34.500> pretty<00:06:34.650> useful<00:06:34.860> to<00:06:35.160> just

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
you know so it's pretty useful to just

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.280 
you know so it's pretty useful to just
having<00:06:35.490> one<00:06:35.730> attack<00:06:36.060> at<00:06:36.360> least<00:06:36.840> in<00:06:36.990> you<00:06:37.200> know

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290
