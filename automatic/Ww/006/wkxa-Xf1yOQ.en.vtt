00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.790 

this<00:01:00.180> water<00:01:00.480> project<00:01:01.080> they're<00:01:01.230> doing<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
straw and all that there they're just

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.080 
straw and all that there they're just
dumping<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.290> water<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.920> crazy

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.320 

it<00:01:09.090> looks<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> calm<00:01:10.310> looks<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> me<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it looks like calm looks to me like the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.970 
it looks like calm looks to me like the
way<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.750> they're<00:01:12.930> piling<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> dirt<00:01:13.710> over

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
way that they're piling that dirt over

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.640 
way that they're piling that dirt over
there<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> water<00:01:15.750> drains<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
there that when this water drains out of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.860 
there that when this water drains out of
this<00:01:16.800> little<00:01:16.979> hole<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.300> gonna<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.660> done

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
this little hole this is gonna be done

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.660 
this little hole this is gonna be done
there<00:01:19.650> won't<00:01:19.800> be<00:01:19.920> anymore

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
there won't be anymore

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
there won't be anymore
they'll<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.630> feel<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.050> across<00:01:22.590> over

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
they'll probably feel that across over

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
they'll probably feel that across over
there<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.370> water<00:01:23.760> will<00:01:23.940> never<00:01:24.150> come<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
there and the water will never come in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.690 
there and the water will never come in
this<00:01:24.690> this<00:01:25.080> Cove<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.490> Cove

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
this this Cove again I think this Cove

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.180 
this this Cove again I think this Cove
is<00:01:26.820> getting<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:28.200> Cove<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.920> filled

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
is getting this Cove is gonna get filled

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:47.300 
is getting this Cove is gonna get filled
in<00:01:29.370> is<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.050> looks<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
in is the way it looks you can see that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
in is the way it looks you can see that
the<00:01:47.820> old<00:01:47.940> ramp<00:01:48.180> used<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.630> straight<00:01:48.869> down

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the old ramp used to go straight down

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
the old ramp used to go straight down
and<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> only<00:01:49.740> way<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.100> even<00:01:50.310> unload

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and now the only way to even unload

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.670 
and now the only way to even unload
anything<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.530> right

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
anything in here is to go to the right

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.320 
anything in here is to go to the right
night<00:01:55.680> said<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> while<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.119> seen

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
night said you know a while back I seen

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.550 
night said you know a while back I seen
him<00:01:57.450> digging<00:01:57.660> that<00:01:57.840> trench<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.350> where<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
him digging that trench right where the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.609 
him digging that trench right where the
boat<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.780> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> reason

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
boat is going out and I think the reason

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.690 
boat is going out and I think the reason
they<00:02:01.740> did<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.190> because<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:04.640> don't<00:02:05.640> know

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
they did that was because I don't know

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.160 
they did that was because I don't know
how<00:02:05.909> many<00:02:06.120> hundreds<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.630> thousands<00:02:07.049> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
how many hundreds of thousands of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.810 
how many hundreds of thousands of
gallons<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> water<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.010> was<00:02:08.130> being<00:02:08.489> trapped

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
gallons of water that was being trapped

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.240 
gallons of water that was being trapped
in<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.299> so<00:02:10.049> they<00:02:10.200> dug<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> trench<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:11.070> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
in here so they dug the trench out so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.490 
in here so they dug the trench out so
when<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:11.549> dumped<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> lake<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:13.080> could<00:02:13.320> go

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
when they dumped a lake this could go

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.810 
when they dumped a lake this could go
down<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.070> could<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.640> water

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
down and they could get all the water

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.740 
down and they could get all the water
out<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.730> I'm<00:02:17.730> betting<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.390> betting
