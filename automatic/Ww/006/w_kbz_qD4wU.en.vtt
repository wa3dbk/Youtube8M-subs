like your petals to be just make sure to
cut<00:01:45.960> quite<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> long<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> sides

cut quite a long way down the sides

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
cut quite a long way down the sides
since<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> lot<00:01:48.990> easier<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
since this will make it a lot easier to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
since this will make it a lot easier to
form<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> flower<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> open<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> folded

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
sides to create a sharper angle but I

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.909 
sides to create a sharper angle but I

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
shades of yellow I repeated every step

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.029 
shades of yellow I repeated every step
and<00:04:32.300> then<00:04:32.569> cut<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.960> yellow<00:04:33.110> paper<00:04:33.500> quite<00:04:34.009> a

and then cut the yellow paper quite a

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.219 
and then cut the yellow paper quite a
long<00:04:34.310> way<00:04:34.550> done<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.120> create<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.449> sharper<00:04:35.900> angle

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
long way done to create a sharper angle

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.820 
long way done to create a sharper angle
as<00:04:36.349> well<00:04:37.389> then<00:04:38.389> I<00:04:38.419> made<00:04:38.690> lots<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.169> cuts<00:04:39.470> in<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
as well then I made lots of cuts in the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.159 
as well then I made lots of cuts in the
yellow<00:04:40.130> paper<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.759> then<00:04:41.270> secured<00:04:41.660> everything

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
yellow paper and then secured everything

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.920 
yellow paper and then secured everything
the<00:04:43.160> yellow<00:04:43.370> paper<00:04:43.639> was<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> bit<00:04:44.300> too<00:04:44.479> white<00:04:44.750> in

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
the yellow paper was a bit too white in

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.809 
the yellow paper was a bit too white in
the<00:04:45.020> beginning<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.009> center<00:04:46.370> ended<00:04:46.669> up

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
the beginning that the center ended up

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.089 
the beginning that the center ended up
being<00:04:47.090> too<00:04:47.360> big<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.020> just<00:04:48.319> cut<00:04:48.650> off<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.830> little

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
being too big so just cut off a little

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.270 
being too big so just cut off a little
bit<00:04:49.250> from<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.729> top<00:04:49.759> and<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.930> are<00:04:50.960> done<00:04:51.280> now

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
bit from the top and you are done now

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.460 
bit from the top and you are done now
since<00:04:52.699> we<00:04:52.820> use<00:04:53.030> hair<00:04:53.300> ties<00:04:53.570> we<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:54.050> easily

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
since we use hair ties we can easily

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.890 
since we use hair ties we can easily
pull<00:04:54.710> through<00:04:55.009> the<00:04:55.160> string<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.669> attach<00:04:56.479> every

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
pull through the string and attach every

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.890 
pull through the string and attach every
flower<00:04:57.169> we<00:04:57.530> created<00:04:58.099> I<00:04:58.340> attach<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.300> ends<00:04:59.720> of

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
flower we created I attach the ends of

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.990 
flower we created I attach the ends of
the<00:05:00.050> string<00:05:00.380> with<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.740> pin<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.310> wall<00:05:01.550> but

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
the string with a pin to the wall but

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.850 
the string with a pin to the wall but
since<00:05:02.270> they<00:05:02.389> didn't<00:05:02.720> look<00:05:02.870> great<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.410> way<00:05:03.620> I

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
since they didn't look great that way I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.950 
since they didn't look great that way I
added<00:05:04.340> another<00:05:04.430> pin<00:05:04.940> right<00:05:05.330> in<00:05:05.509> the<00:05:05.630> middle

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
added another pin right in the middle

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.930 
added another pin right in the middle
and<00:05:06.169> then<00:05:06.680> place<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.340> middle<00:05:07.639> flower

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
and then place the middle flower

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.210 
and then place the middle flower
underneath<00:05:08.509> this<00:05:09.080> way<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.560> flowers<00:05:09.770> look

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
underneath this way the flowers look

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.370 
underneath this way the flowers look
towards<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.030> not<00:05:11.090> towards<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.750> floor<00:05:12.110> as

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
towards you and not towards the floor as

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.499 
towards you and not towards the floor as
you<00:05:12.979> can<00:05:13.130> see<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.520> made<00:05:13.759> a<00:05:13.820> few<00:05:14.090> more<00:05:14.300> basic

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
you can see I made a few more basic

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.839 
you can see I made a few more basic
