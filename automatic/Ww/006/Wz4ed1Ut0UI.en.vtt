highest rate of duel obviously the
highest<00:04:30.949> rated<00:04:31.190> card<00:04:31.340> because<00:04:31.490> he's<00:04:31.580> the

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
highest rated card because he's the

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.469 
highest rated card because he's the
first<00:04:31.849> one<00:04:31.910> then<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:32.780> get<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.930> Benzema<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:35.120> he's

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
first one then we get a Benzema so he's

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.260 
first one then we get a Benzema so he's
got<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:36.160> he's<00:04:37.160> got<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.370> man<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.699> match<00:04:37.849> so<00:04:37.880> I'm

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
got a he's got a man of the match so I'm

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.310 
got a he's got a man of the match so I'm
not<00:04:38.389> sure<00:04:38.449> does<00:04:38.630> he<00:04:38.750> have<00:04:38.840> team<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:39.050> season<00:04:39.259> no

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
not sure does he have team in season no

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.080 
not sure does he have team in season no
I<00:04:39.349> think<00:04:39.470> he's<00:04:39.650> only<00:04:39.800> got<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.009> minute<00:04:40.310> match<00:04:40.610> we

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
I think he's only got a minute match we

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.810 
I think he's only got a minute match we
got<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> bed<00:04:42.139> done<00:04:42.289> Mimi's<00:04:42.740> ovitch<00:04:43.070> which<00:04:43.520> he
