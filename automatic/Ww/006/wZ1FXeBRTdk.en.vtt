therefore it is not without its not
outside<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.180> room<00:02:13.390> possibility<00:02:14.170> too<00:02:14.320> bad

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
these two pillars of their respective

universes come together in a epic combat

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.800 
universes come together in a epic combat
so<00:02:23.020> in<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.380> regard<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:25.240> know<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.540> as

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
so in that regard I you know it's as

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.930 
so in that regard I you know it's as
possible<00:02:26.530> first<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.700> argument

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
possible first of all so this argument

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.570 
possible first of all so this argument
is<00:02:28.240> necessary<00:02:28.930> because<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.770> may<00:02:30.040> come<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:30.400> one

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
is necessary because it may come up one

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.140 
is necessary because it may come up one
day<00:02:31.050> furthermore<00:02:32.160> flight<00:02:33.160> does<00:02:33.610> not<00:02:33.760> help<00:02:33.970> you

finding kryptonite in the roxys trucking
at<00:03:51.760> Superman<00:03:53.340> would<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.489> small<00:03:54.850> enough<00:03:54.880> that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
at Superman would be small enough that

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.440 
at Superman would be small enough that
in<00:03:56.050> i<00:03:57.330> would<00:03:58.330> say<00:03:58.570> probably<00:03:58.620> 15<00:03:59.620> out<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.450> 16

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
in i would say probably 15 out of 16

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.880 
in i would say probably 15 out of 16
times<00:04:02.430> Superman<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:03.580> winter<00:04:04.709> where<00:04:05.709> did<00:04:05.860> you

times Superman with winter where did you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.640 
times Superman with winter where did you
even<00:04:06.040> get<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.340> number<00:04:06.760> i<00:04:07.180> use<00:04:07.560> statistics<00:04:08.560> to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
even get that number i use statistics to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.900 
even get that number i use statistics to

manipulate various sources of data just

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.229 
manipulate various sources of data just
now<00:04:13.800> incorrectly<00:04:14.800> yes<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.610> unethically

now incorrectly yes and unethically

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.259

what might the other those statistics
have<00:04:24.070> been<00:04:24.640> sustained<00:04:25.290> okay<00:04:26.290> so<00:04:26.350> not<00:04:26.710> numb

can look at it in the fact that Hulk has

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.390 
can look at it in the fact that Hulk has
fortune<00:05:23.690> on<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.930> side<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:24.470> know<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.250> sounds

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
fortune on the side I know it sounds

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.890 
fortune on the side I know it sounds
like<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.610> weakness<00:05:26.000> at<00:05:26.180> first<00:05:26.360> maybe<00:05:26.600> you<00:05:26.690> stop

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
like a weakness at first maybe you stop

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.690 
like a weakness at first maybe you stop
and<00:05:27.080> think<00:05:27.170> about<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.980> story<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.490> on<00:05:28.670> a

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
and think about it the story is on a

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.260 
and think about it the story is on a
Hulk<00:05:28.970> side<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:30.340> win<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.460> debate<00:05:31.670> though<00:05:32.060> we

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
Hulk side I win this debate though we

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.050 
Hulk side I win this debate though we
are<00:05:32.360> not<00:05:32.510> asking<00:05:32.720> if<00:05:33.710> this<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.460> written<00:05:34.730> by<00:05:35.030> a

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
are not asking if this is written by a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.190 
are not asking if this is written by a
bias<00:05:35.510> person<00:05:36.520> would<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.700> Hulk<00:05:37.910> win<00:05:38.210> therefore

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
bias person would the Hulk win therefore

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.620 
bias person would the Hulk win therefore
I<00:05:39.350> believe<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.890> storyline<00:05:40.460> aspect<00:05:41.270> of<00:05:41.420> it

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
I believe the storyline aspect of it

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.420 
I believe the storyline aspect of it
should<00:05:42.620> actually<00:05:42.860> be<00:05:43.220> volatile<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.060> void<00:05:44.240> and

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
should actually be volatile and void and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.370 
should actually be volatile and void and
then<00:05:46.430> we<00:05:46.700> also<00:05:46.850> can't<00:05:47.180> Oh<00:05:47.360> their<00:05:47.630> brain<00:05:48.350> power

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
then we also can't Oh their brain power

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.860 
then we also can't Oh their brain power
or<00:05:49.070> strategy<00:05:49.670> than<00:05:49.820> either<00:05:50.240> because<00:05:50.660> that's

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
or strategy than either because that's

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.740 
or strategy than either because that's
not<00:05:51.020> really<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:51.290> power<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:52.580> of<00:05:53.000> itself<00:05:53.390> very

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
not really a power and of itself very

true<00:05:54.050> Superman<00:05:54.800> is<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.980> leader<00:05:55.510> but<00:05:56.510> that

true Superman is a leader but that

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.340 
true Superman is a leader but that
doesn't<00:05:57.230> necessarily<00:05:57.350> convey<00:05:58.070> that<00:05:58.430> he<00:05:59.030> has

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
doesn't necessarily convey that he has

doesn't necessarily convey that he has

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
strategic potential so in that case if

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.640 
strategic potential so in that case if
we're<00:06:02.540> just<00:06:02.690> going<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.840> be<00:06:02.960> comparing<00:06:03.320> powers

we're just going to be comparing powers

we're just going to be comparing powers
no<00:06:04.370> one<00:06:04.520> would<00:06:04.700> win<00:06:04.880> because<00:06:05.810> they<00:06:06.560> both<00:06:06.740> have

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
no one would win because they both have

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.190 
no one would win because they both have
a<00:06:07.010> serious<00:06:07.460> weakness<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.120> at<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:08.990> same<00:06:09.140> time

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
a serious weakness and at the same time

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
they're evenly matched so in that case
