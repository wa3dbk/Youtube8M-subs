00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.870
 I 'm loading 16 years old in the first one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.650
 training year as technical products 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.070
 be done 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 at phoenix contact between the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.779
 training we have really great 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 possibilities and even creative 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.540
 unfold 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 For example, we now have the degree 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.000
 project phase I have a grill 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.180
 constructed for my father was because he 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.560
 that really liked to have and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 I'm looking forward to it too 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.040
 build and show them then too 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.890
 because you then just this joy of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 is that you did everything and that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 then you have it yourself 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.629
 do not stop everywhere and we stop 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.629
 this possibility 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.440
 hello I are fine, the most expensive 17 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360
 Years old teach my education 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.490
 phoenix contact to the tool mechanic 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.730
 i just wanted to know what profession her 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.960
 june learn technical product designer 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.030
 during my internship at philip 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.490
 But then I noticed that contact 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 the products tool mechanic my 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.620
 dream job is still a lot of fun 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.720
 makes when you can tell on one 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.600
 work exactly one hundredth of a second 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.350
 that's just everything everything fits 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.240
 When falling, you must always be beautiful 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.400
 Be careful that the arrows are correct 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.360
 is because otherwise maybe times accurate 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.010
 do not presume down 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 partially up to a tenth 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.729
 accuracy minutes with it 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.340
 fit together 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.869
 the atmosphere at a workshop is 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 very good you have a lot of fun together 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.060
 laughs a lot helps each other 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.979
 I'm looking forward to the team 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.320
 training that will take place soon 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.850
 because there is a lot more contact with 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.750
 his colleagues also have those with 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.000
 you would not go my name 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.820
 This is a long time I am 18 years old 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 after training as a mechanic 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.850
 There was nothing much fun for it 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.030
 at the training to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.530
 Industriemechaniker make me that we 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.140
 can work a lot with machines 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.240
 many workpieces on the machine itself 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 to edit 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.220
 a highlight of the execution was also 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.320
 that we as apprentices from the first 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.819
 at the Hanover Fair 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.939
 and 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.370
 been captured as guides, we believe that 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.580
 We students groups over Hanover 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.090
 fair for the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.420
 to show hannover 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.239
 ten companies also show and students for 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.400
 So our company for Phoenix 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.349
 contact exchanges in my colleagues 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 Together you can have fun but you can 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.890
 also be a bit silly but you 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.890
 still comes to poverty
