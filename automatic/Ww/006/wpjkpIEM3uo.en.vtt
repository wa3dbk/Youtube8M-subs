of the things that's nice about a
portable<00:00:57.300> recorder<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.859> you'll

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
portable recorder is that now you'll

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.630 
portable recorder is that now you'll
have<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> ability<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.789> use<00:01:00.059> headphones<00:01:00.530> now

have the ability to use headphones now
the<00:01:02.640> trouble<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> output<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the trouble is that the output out of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.100 
the trouble is that the output out of
the<00:01:05.010> dr<00:01:05.220> 100<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> line<00:01:06.299> level<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.960> very

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the dr 100 is a line level so it's very

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.670 
the dr 100 is a line level so it's very
very<00:01:07.380> hot<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.979> signal<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.680> over

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
very hot the signal is very very over

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.980 
very hot the signal is very very over
driven<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> feed<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> directly<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
driven if you feed it directly into the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.460 
driven if you feed it directly into the
Canon<00:01:13.500> 5d<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.310> 70<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.810> found<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Canon 5d or the 70 so what we found is a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.609 
Canon 5d or the 70 so what we found is a
cable<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.729> line<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.509> mic<00:01:18.689> level<00:01:19.110> cable

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
cable that is a line to mic level cable

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
cable that is a line to mic level cable
and<00:01:19.939> what<00:01:20.939> we're<00:01:21.090> doing<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.750> feeding

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and what we're doing is we're feeding

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
and what we're doing is we're feeding
that<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> camera<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that into the camera so now we have a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.140 
that into the camera so now we have a
sync<00:01:24.570> track<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.950> sounds<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:26.970> good

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
sync track that that sounds pretty good

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
sync track that that sounds pretty good
but<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.140> camera's<00:01:28.530> automatic

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
but because of the camera's automatic

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
but because of the camera's automatic
gain<00:01:29.640> control<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.270> known<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.570> AGC<00:01:31.290> we're<00:01:32.220> going

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
gain control so known as AGC we're going

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.749 
gain control so known as AGC we're going
to<00:01:32.610> hear<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.180> lot<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.710> pumping<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> listen

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to hear a lot of pumping so if we listen

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.100 
to hear a lot of pumping so if we listen
for<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> second<00:01:37.820> that's<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> noise<00:01:39.270> level<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
for a second that's the noise level that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
for a second that's the noise level that
we're<00:01:40.850> experiencing<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.000> complete<00:01:42.450> quiet

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
we're experiencing with complete quiet

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630 
we're experiencing with complete quiet
so<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> cameras<00:01:44.070> automatic<00:01:44.490> gain

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so with the cameras automatic gain

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.710 
so with the cameras automatic gain
control<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.030> should<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.270> brought<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
control it should have brought up the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
control it should have brought up the
sound<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> room<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:46.890> hardly

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sound of the room which there's hardly

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.440 
sound of the room which there's hardly
anything<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.240> quiet

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
anything in here it's a pretty quiet

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.730 
anything in here it's a pretty quiet
room<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.500> listen<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.009> second<00:01:54.740> that's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
room so if we listen for a second that's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.760 
room so if we listen for a second that's
the<00:01:55.979> noise<00:01:56.219> level<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.770> experiencing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the noise level that we're experiencing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.679 
the noise level that we're experiencing

just because of the AGC you can use the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.230 
just because of the AGC you can use the
