 in every game we saw doing real face of attack 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 we might be without power 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 I do not know I have indeed seen those two faces of that team 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.239

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.530
 home comes 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 then they got a red card to a minute and then the changes that as 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.229
 you view the often tactical point of view so enormously that 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.030
 does not want to check that because it will be against us on Sunday 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.410
 again completely different 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.330

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.430
 years away from us requested to cooperate 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.590
 and of course we do that sinecure 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.360
 that's more from the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 he collegiality that you say yes to that I think those two hours are not 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 so much sense for az but good if one asks for it then nice to join 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.440
 persevere fatness of a group 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.120

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.159
 new board cases added 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.840

 He was able to see me fit short of course but first a Turkish 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.230
 small de and the current play 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.640
 it is really one that we play 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.570
 who really has qualities that you can see that we no longer have 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.250
 You recognize that in the way football plays its position play 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.519
 quality in May 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.959
 it is still very intense 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.490
 the competitions to never forget and Alkmaar 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.040
 was the race on April 18 in 2009 the alkmaarders could be champions of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.459
 the netherlands all suffice for a draw 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.479
 the butner ruined that party then just before time to make the two one 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.510
 incidentally, hz became a week later 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.379
 still champion 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.299
 the last three years for vitesse no chance at stake two years ago 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.329
 became no less than 4 0 and last year it was via a partly due to this goal from 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.329
 each passing through 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 year saw the latest news 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.009
 tip a lot more euros now we were wanting more in myanmar 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.559
 Bartoli year wants the market a lot 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.749
 who has the goal for the trip fears it is a bit crazy period now the 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.069
 transfer window decide how do you think that as a trainer those last days before 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.039
 the deadline 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 that is on which side your status if you want to have players 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.819
 then the then you hope that you can use it after using it but if you 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.139
 trees that the players leave then this is as soon as possible close that window i 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.809
 think it just isn't good for both and it makes the job work 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.009
 difficult but well it's just the way it is and then you shouldn't have it 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.059
 You have to deal with nagging 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.609
 Then you can say something about the situation they are the players on the rise 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.299
 we hope that we are very busy
