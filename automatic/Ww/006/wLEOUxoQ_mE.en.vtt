supposed<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.570> lava<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> turns

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
supposed to be lava so when it turns

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
supposed to be lava so when it turns
back<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.399> water<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.450> melted<00:01:57.960> from<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
back the water that was melted from the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160 
back the water that was melted from the
ice<00:01:58.380> becomes<00:01:58.920> lava<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
ice becomes lava so it's a little bit of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.920 
ice becomes lava so it's a little bit of
a<00:02:01.259> problem<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.390> wouldn't<00:02:03.390> use<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.719> in
