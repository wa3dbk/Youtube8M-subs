you could actually say that the choice
of<00:00:47.700> material<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.230> strange<00:00:49.649> as

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of material is not so very strange as

the whole industry for the glassworks
this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.270> something<00:01:03.449> completely<00:01:04.379> new

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
this is also something completely new

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
this is also something completely new
but<00:01:05.369> something<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.360> very

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
but something that they would be very

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.260 
but something that they would be very
happy<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> continue<00:01:07.320> doing<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> despite<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
happy to continue doing and despite the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
happy to continue doing and despite the
fact<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.900> manufactured<00:01:10.530> most

things<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.369> over<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> years<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:12.600> bits<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
things here over the years these bits of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
things they have ever produced I was

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.260 
things they have ever produced I was
excited<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.520> also<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
excited because what was also one of the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
excited because what was also one of the
absolute<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.049> strongest<00:01:22.530> Swedish<00:01:23.310> brands

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
absolute the strongest Swedish brands

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.410 
absolute the strongest Swedish brands
and<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.630> cooperate<00:01:25.640> those<00:01:26.640> brands<00:01:26.970> together<00:01:27.299> i

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and to cooperate those brands together i

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170 
and to cooperate those brands together i
think<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.320> amazing<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.400> also<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
think it's it's amazing and it's also a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899 
think it's it's amazing and it's also a
new<00:01:30.780> chance<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.439> us<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:32.280> mean<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
new chance for us i think i mean we do a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.810 
new chance for us i think i mean we do a
lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> different<00:01:33.600> projects<00:01:33.960> from<00:01:34.110> ought<00:01:34.409> to

lot of different projects from ought to

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
lot of different projects from ought to
tableware<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.329> things<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
tableware and all things but we are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.920 
tableware and all things but we are
never<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.799> far<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.130> i<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.369> being<00:01:39.150> involved<00:01:39.720> in
