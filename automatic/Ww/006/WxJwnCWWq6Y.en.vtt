00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.670
 welcome all subscribers to the channel here 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.099
 fan with you rude today for a super test 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.990
 brought another new tank this time 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.490
 this is not some kind of regular comment and this 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.710
 the car that was supposed to be 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 pumped ninth level into new 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 branches of american and walls but unfortunately 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 developers somehow decided this tank 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.470
 partially redo and make just 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 ten which can be received 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.019
 either lbz or for g to title this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.000
 tank h3 m48 and two t-54 2t 123rd 6 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.309
 probably you are wondering why 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 in this tank so many names on the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.300
 In fact, the answer is extremely simple American 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.899
 the engineers simply decided to combine the two 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.480
 tank 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.370
 m48 a2 and t-54 2 from m48 we have a case 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 t-54 tower and at the same time new unique 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.280
 dough cannon 23rd 6 is essentially the same 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 as on test 10-5 only in a hurry 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 option eventually turns out 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 really good combination 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.079
 which is still historically confirmed 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.149
 there are developers this machine did not invent 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 and personally, I think that our game is given 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.900
 the tank would fit just gorgeous but to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.909
 Unfortunately not every tenth level 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.100
 some kind of promotion as simple as 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.450
 a dozen that could deflate 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 Well, those people who were waiting 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.979
 ordinary t-54 and to which rather 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 total will be nine in the new branch 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 American st not worry 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.650
 because there is still a chance that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.680
 this car will appear there after all 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 this is an ordinary t-54 2 and this car 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.430
 really different firstly there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 slightly different body in second there 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 still 100 five millimeter cannon and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 in the third it is still another tank 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.100
 who is behind the model back in 2012 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.229
 although knowing the developers from him could 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 just give up long ago but in the end just 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 use his tower as 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.750
 here we are now seeing so if you are all 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.000
 still waiting for an alternative thread 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.680
 American and Stan is not experiencing either 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.360
 developers will find the new ninth 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 level in this thread or all the same 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 will force ordinary t-54 2 in 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.680
 addition I will tell if the subject is interesting to you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.630
 branches alternative stts us then i will 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 very happy and and reveal in a separate 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.830
 videos you only need to write 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.660
 about it in the comments and like until 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.180
 my video well now let's not 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.250
 get distracted and get back to our hybrid 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.620
 historical component i hope you 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.080
 understood so let's go to tth 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.390
 on booking as two ST-shki our tank 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.690
 quite good body we have exactly 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.180
 same as new m48 patton oooh 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.760
 when going wait wait got very good 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.010
 buff armor is in the forehead of the hull and yes I 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.050
 we understand 48 pattani best example 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 good booking but nonetheless 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.100
 at least he does not make the way 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.170
 and indeed when you go and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.460
 wait for his forehead to become somehow hold on 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.320
 blow but because that's not all 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.120
 ends with our hybrid yet 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.550
 there is a well armored tower 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640
 which has very good rational 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.530
 angles of armor and 202 millimeters in 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.660
 forehead all this suggests that our 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.600
 new art shki can tank 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.310
 the tower and much bolder than m48 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.680
 patton and in addition to quite good 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.170
 booking we still have a powerful 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.870
 120 millimeter cannon which is essentially 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.390
 exactly the same as in test 10 and 5 but with 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.670
 this with better mothers if dp bad 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.260
 accuracy but the most interesting thing is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.750
 movable from our tank 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.430
 it is essentially the same as that of m48 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380
 patton and but at the same time 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.300
 the speed is also a bit more it 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.489
 certainly not the level of the Soviet st but all 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.380
 Tanchiki still be quite frisky in 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.480
 the result may seem that this tank is in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.209
 everyone is better than m48 patton 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.950
 or m60 but unfortunately review here 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.470
 slightly worse and still have some 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.420
 indicators that roll there subside 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.910
 so do not think what it will be 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.760
 then above imba all the more tth these early 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.530
 they can either get worse or better at 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.930
 anyway tank is enough 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.180
 interesting if it is a riddle then i 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.250
 I will be very happy for him to fight well 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.350
 what do you think you must write in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.420
 comments on this for today all with 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.550
 you were Hamish do not forget to put 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.200
 like a video subscribe to my channel 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.730
 reference to which is in the description 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.459
 also on the channel here's a fan 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.459
