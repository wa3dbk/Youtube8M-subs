one-of-a-kind tubes tell us a little bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.660 
one-of-a-kind tubes tell us a little bit
about<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.729> tube<00:01:17.970> manufacturing<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:20.400> done

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
about the tube manufacturing it's done

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
about the tube manufacturing it's done
in<00:01:21.110> progress<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.820> yes<00:01:23.820> yes<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
in progress it's so yes yes and the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
in progress it's so yes yes and the
tubes<00:01:26.280> themselves<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.299> unique<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
tubes themselves are very unique and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.420 
tubes themselves are very unique and
there<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.860> zoom<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.700> them

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
there and we can zoom in on one of them

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.480 
there and we can zoom in on one of them
yeah<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.640> tube<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.030> quite<00:01:33.299> unique<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.490> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
yeah this tube is quite unique and is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.359 
yeah this tube is quite unique and is
based<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> 300<00:01:36.990> P

62 B yeah
how<00:01:47.380> long<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.799> been<00:01:47.829> in<00:01:48.039> manufacturing

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
how long have you been in manufacturing

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.130 
how long have you been in manufacturing
the<00:01:49.469> 62<00:01:50.469> B<00:01:50.649> or<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.299> progenitor<00:01:52.299> -<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.960> was

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
the 62 B or the the progenitor - it was

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.919 
the 62 B or the the progenitor - it was
the<00:01:53.319> 52<00:01:53.859> correct<00:01:54.250> yes<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:55.000> understand<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.509> 52

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
the 52 correct yes we understand the 52

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.090 
the 52 correct yes we understand the 52
B<00:01:56.110> remove<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> sixty-two<00:01:57.100> beats<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.429> top

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
B remove the sixty-two beats the top

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.380 
B remove the sixty-two beats the top
what's<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.280> failure<00:02:00.640> rate<00:02:00.819> of<00:02:01.000> these<00:02:01.119> tubes

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
what's the failure rate of these tubes

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.380 
what's the failure rate of these tubes
are<00:02:01.600> very<00:02:01.630> low<00:02:01.990> from<00:02:02.170> what<00:02:02.289> I<00:02:02.319> understand<00:02:03.390> yeah

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
are very low from what I understand yeah

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.779 
are very low from what I understand yeah
yeah<00:02:04.750> low<00:02:04.959> failure<00:02:05.259> rate<00:02:05.560> they<00:02:05.979> last<00:02:06.310> forever

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
yeah low failure rate they last forever

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.960 
yeah low failure rate they last forever
yeah<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:07.959> depends<00:02:08.319> also<00:02:08.700> from<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
yeah it's depends also from the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.180 
yeah it's depends also from the
amplifier<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.599> know<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.810> bias<00:02:11.590> point

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
amplifier you know the bias point

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.910 
amplifier you know the bias point
voltage<00:02:12.400> at<00:02:12.849> MC<00:02:13.150> should<00:02:13.329> be<00:02:13.480> correct<00:02:13.780> when<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
voltage at MC should be correct when the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
voltage at MC should be correct when the
measurements<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.329> working<00:02:16.660> condition
