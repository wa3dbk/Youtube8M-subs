00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.760
 how about my friends my name is edu 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.120
 herrera service engineer 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.950
 canon digital copiers 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.410
 this time I bring you a small 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.030
 tutorial of a team canon yr 30 35 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.220
 completely digital 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.260
 and this time the tutorial is about 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.510
 on how to get a credential 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.699
 not only to leaf in the front by the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.190
 two sides without having to use the bypass or 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.260
 take out the sheet from the drawers and go back to 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.359
 flip it and so on 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.089
 it is very simple the steps that we are going to 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.820
 follow simply you have to do them at 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.460
 foot of the letter so that everything does not come out 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 we go and start with functions 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 special 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.800
 then the image combination 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.870
 next ltr 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.560
 we are going to use the option of the medium that 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.390
 It's 4 in 1 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.580
 following 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 tells us here that we select the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.630
 good paper size we will leave 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.700
 in letter size accept 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.979
 we give it done 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 at this point it is very important that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.130
 we in scale of copy we put 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.729
 direct we do it done and also 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.490
 important is that we select text 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.380
 photo that is in this case the credential and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 here we can play with this setting and in 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 this case I will lower two dots 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 I re-enter functions again 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.690
 special since I memorized nothing in 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.980
 the page two memory modes 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 we will use n1 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.770
 for this we are going to finish a name 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.050
 keep the name here in this case in 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.860
 mexico we use the credential him 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.860
 we call ife 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.730
 you can give it a name that 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.450
 you like, we give you to accept 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.010
 and this is where we are going to save now 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
 that we are going to save tells me you want 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.670
 save this option well let's 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 save all the settings we made 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.370
 Image shift combination 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.459
 paper size ltr 4 in 1 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 text photo with the small setting that I 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.130
 I made it clear I think I do want 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.700
 save it 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.490
 once it is saved here we accept it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.030
 fact we already have here in confirmation of 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.910
 options everything 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.880
 we did right now but where was that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.040
 fit good we're just going to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.940
 enter traditional function or functions 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.300
 additional options for copying options 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.860
 standard 1 keys for normal screen and 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.500
 right away in this one let's move on to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.080
 page to page number 6 here we 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.300
 it says below 6 at once we enter 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.190
 mode memory 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.710
 then remembering that we did 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.440
 our settings in the m1 memory 1 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.350
 we give you to accept fact and fact 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.520
 and here we have our says then 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.110
 every one of us we want to get a 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.580
 credential on both sides a license 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.440
 with his photography on both sides 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.510
 as simple as the first ife 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.510
 we are ready to take our copy 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.629
 good friends as we finished 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.540
 configure our credential function 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.180
 or ife followed we will take our 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.849
 copy 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.780
 let's try to get it out first 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.780
 the part of the photograph 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.250
 we place it in the glass we go down in the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.630
 of efe so that it does not enter 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.210
 we do not ask ife and then the key 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 start state what the team does 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.990
 is to scan us the first document 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.670
 right away 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.670
 we turn over our credential 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.150
 we try to put it more or less in the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.730
 same address on 1st 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.780
 the document that we scan we go back to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.780
 press the start key 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.910
 and this is where we have to give it done 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.910
 because we no longer have documents that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.910
 scan more than the front and the back 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.619
 already our original 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:39.249
 and here they have the copy of the credential 

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:41.399
 on both sides in front of a single 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.399
 sheet 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.250
 I hope and this tutorial has served you 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.900
 remember your friend herrera engineer of 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.200
 technical service copy to digital 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.200
 scanner
