you will only be limited by your
imagination<00:00:23.440> chemistry<00:00:24.440> is<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.560> combination

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
imagination chemistry is a combination

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.100 
imagination chemistry is a combination
of<00:00:25.610> theoretical<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:26.330> practical<00:00:26.360> so<00:00:26.990> you

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
of theoretical and practical so you

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.150 
of theoretical and practical so you
can't<00:00:27.290> just<00:00:27.320> learn<00:00:27.500> chemistry<00:00:27.800> from<00:00:28.040> a

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
can't just learn chemistry from a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.920 
can't just learn chemistry from a
textbook<00:00:28.520> there's<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.090> lot<00:00:29.119> of<00:00:29.270> important

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
textbook there's a lot of important

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.810 
textbook there's a lot of important
background<00:00:30.439> theory<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:31.189> it's<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.430> hands-on

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
background theory but it's a hands-on

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.850 
background theory but it's a hands-on
science<00:00:32.060> as<00:00:32.450> well<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.200> actually<00:00:33.440> got<00:00:33.710> to

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
science as well so you actually got to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.590 
science as well so you actually got to
not<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:34.520> delve<00:00:34.760> into<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.060> books<00:00:35.300> but<00:00:35.480> you

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
not just delve into the books but you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.760 
not just delve into the books but you
got<00:00:35.720> to<00:00:35.750> get<00:00:35.930> into<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.230> lab<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:36.590> got<00:00:36.740> to

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
got to get into the lab and you got to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.350 
got to get into the lab and you got to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
I finished my degree I can do pretty

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
I finished my degree I can do pretty
much<00:02:58.290> anything<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> field

of<00:03:00.090> chemistry<00:03:00.270> which<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> fairly<00:03:01.170> broad

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
of chemistry which is a fairly broad

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.100 
of chemistry which is a fairly broad
area<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.420> mean<00:03:03.600> that's<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.900> beautiful

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
area so I mean that's the beautiful

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.810 
area so I mean that's the beautiful
thing<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.620> doing<00:03:04.890> science<00:03:05.100> at<00:03:05.340> Monash<00:03:05.670> it's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
thing of doing science at Monash it's

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.340 
thing of doing science at Monash it's
that<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.690> pigeonholed<00:03:07.050> into

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
that I don't have to be pigeonholed into

either synthetic or analytical chemistry

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.600 
either synthetic or analytical chemistry
just<00:03:09.750> yet<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:10.860> what<00:03:10.980> appeals<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.400> me

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
just yet I can see what appeals to me

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.790 
just yet I can see what appeals to me
and<00:03:11.820> then<00:03:11.940> later<00:03:12.120> choose<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.810> head<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
and then later choose and head on in

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.290 
and then later choose and head on in
that<00:03:13.950> pathway

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that pathway

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.360 
that pathway
