matter it's nice clear packaging these

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600 
matter it's nice clear packaging these
batteries<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.890> such<00:01:16.890> come<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.430> different

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
batteries and such come with different

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.340 
batteries and such come with different
colors<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.600> depends<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
mentioned before they come in three

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
mentioned before they come in three
thousand<00:01:32.310> milliamps<00:01:32.729> six<00:01:33.060> thousand

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
thousand milliamps six thousand

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.899 
thousand milliamps six thousand
milliamps<00:01:33.869> nine<00:01:34.770> thousand<00:01:35.280> millions<00:01:35.610> which

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
milliamps nine thousand millions which

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
milliamps nine thousand millions which
is<00:01:36.060> what<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.890> largest<00:01:38.189> one

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
is what we have here and the largest one

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.399 
is what we have here and the largest one
at<00:01:38.670> 12,000<00:01:39.299> milliamps

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.840 

so<00:01:43.039> we'll<00:01:43.159> pop<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> top<00:01:43.929> which<00:01:44.929> is<00:01:45.079> easy<00:01:45.289> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
so we'll pop the top which is easy and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.050 
so we'll pop the top which is easy and
we<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:46.999> corresponding<00:01:47.749> magnets<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:49.060> gold

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
we have corresponding magnets and gold

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.899 
we have corresponding magnets and gold
connectors<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.710> simply<00:01:52.100> easy<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:55.700> take

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
connectors so it's simply easy to take

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.219 
connectors so it's simply easy to take
the<00:01:56.149> head<00:01:56.479> portion<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:58.929> get<00:01:59.929> it<00:02:00.049> close

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the head portion and get it close

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.679 
the head portion and get it close
together<00:02:00.609> and<00:02:01.609> it<00:02:02.599> clips<00:02:02.869> in<00:02:03.020> place<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.450> that's

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
together and it clips in place so that's

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.440 
together and it clips in place so that's
the<00:02:05.840> hyper<00:02:06.619> juice<00:02:06.979> expand<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.969> is<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.299> white
