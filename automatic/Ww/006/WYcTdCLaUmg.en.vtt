00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
the end and that's how we know we need
the<00:01:56.159> battery<00:01:56.490> next<00:01:56.850> also<00:01:57.240> he<00:01:57.360> says<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> need<00:01:57.899> my

now is find four pieces of meat spread
throughout<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> map<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.409> spawn<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
throughout the map they spawn in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
throughout the map they spawn in
different<00:02:05.100> locations<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> four<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.270> in

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
different locations in the four are in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
different locations in the four are in
