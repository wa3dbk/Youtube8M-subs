00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.929 
mind the last thing I really want to
mention<00:01:15.600> real<00:01:15.720> quick<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:17.189> turbo<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mention real quick is the turbo in this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.080 
mention real quick is the turbo in this
car<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.390> ridiculous<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:20.790> crazy

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
car is just ridiculous it's just crazy

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
car is just ridiculous it's just crazy
really<00:01:21.689> intense<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> car<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.049> slow<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
really intense the car is very slow and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
really intense the car is very slow and
the<00:01:25.380> turbo<00:01:25.680> lags<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.549> takes<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> while

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the turbo lags there it takes a while

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.359 
the turbo lags there it takes a while
for<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> turbo<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.840> kick<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.369> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
for the turbo to really kick in so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
for the turbo to really kick in so
sometimes<00:01:30.000> you'll<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.930> looks<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.290> I'm

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
sometimes you'll see it looks like I'm

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.520 
sometimes you'll see it looks like I'm
maybe<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.720> throttle<00:01:34.140> halfway

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
maybe you know on the throttle halfway

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
maybe you know on the throttle halfway
or<00:01:34.680> something<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> all

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
or something but I'm really on it all

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
or something but I'm really on it all
the<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.960> turbo<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.650> really

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the way and the turbo is just not really

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
the way and the turbo is just not really
kicked<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:39.829> it's<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.009> powerful<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
kicked in it's so powerful that if it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
kicked in it's so powerful that if it
kicks<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.100> going

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
kicks in all the way for you know going

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609 
kicks in all the way for you know going
around<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> turn<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.750> slower<00:01:46.170> speed<00:01:46.380> or

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
around a turn at a slower speed or

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.670 
around a turn at a slower speed or
something<00:01:46.979> even<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.700> high<00:01:47.790> speed<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> kicks

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
something even a high speed if it kicks

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.770 
something even a high speed if it kicks
and<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.210> stand<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> gas

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and all the way and you stand the gas

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.740 
and all the way and you stand the gas
pedal<00:01:52.259> you'll<00:01:53.030> you're<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> spin<00:01:54.570> out

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
pedal you'll you're going to spin out

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.709 
pedal you'll you're going to spin out
and<00:01:54.780> crash<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.549> intense<00:01:56.909> but

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and crash so it's really intense but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
and crash so it's really intense but
it's<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.020> cool<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it's really cool because on the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's really cool because on the
straights<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.509> after<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> corner<00:02:02.030> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
straights or you know after a corner you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.389 
straights or you know after a corner you
know<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.420> straight<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.399> turbo

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
know you're going straight and turbo

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
know you're going straight and turbo
kicks<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> feels<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.329> you're<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.960> a
