00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello i'm margot kinsey i'm 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.349
 home chef and today I'm going 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.570
 to show you how to do well 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 whipped cream 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.929
 so you just need a drummer 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.930
 electric 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 and then some liquid cream that you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 just got out of the fridge 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 so to make a success of your cream 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.960
 whipped the trick it's from them that the bowl 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:37.290
 and the drummer is cool so for 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.809
 that I put 5 minutes in the freezer 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 five minutes after we go out it's fine 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.600
 fresh and there you can fix them on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 your drummer then if you have a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 drummer my hand you just put the bowl 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 in which you are going to make the cream 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.660
 whipped and the two metallic fruits 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.920
 of a freezer then you do that it's 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920
 your cream in the bowl 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.879
 Another little trick to avoid 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 it splashes everywhere when you 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.970
 start whipping cream it's 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 put a cloth on the machine as 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.810
 that it covers well before the sure that 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.740
 it's not going to splash you can put in 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740
 walk to the maximum 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.530
 you look a little bit once 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 it starts to take you can 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.360
 lift the towel and continue to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 wish 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 by looking at it well then the difficulty 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.480
 with a whipped cream 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's not necessary to go too far 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.700
 otherwise it becomes butter so you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.800
 get your drummer out of the cream when 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.410
 you see that it makes spikes your 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.480
 whipped cream is ready if I continue 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.970
 it will make lumps and it will make 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.530
 butter whipped cream is ready 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.740
 you know now how to make a cream 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.720
 whipped you can use it in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 desserts in the preparations of 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.370
 desserts or other salty preparations 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.050
