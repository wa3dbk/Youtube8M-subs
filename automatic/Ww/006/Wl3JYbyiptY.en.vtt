00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello people good afternoon good morning good 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.219
 night 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 this is the first video that we are 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.960
 doing there, it's not part, it's a store 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.880
 new 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 we are with a new proposal and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 of customer service a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.449
 differentiated service to people looking for 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.920
 be a consultant for supplementation and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.540
 not a seller of supplements 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 first sellers is the one who saves 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 Anything for the price is here. 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 needing a take a job and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.290
 concentrated and the staff pushes for it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.629
 is isolated 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 we do not want this we indicates the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.370
 that the customer really needs 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 and how do I know what our first video is like 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 So, these people are going to start talking 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 bit of me and for as long as I think 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 that thing that anyone who is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.239
 training there independent of the activity 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.229
 physics that makes running hour of drinking 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 the martial art of everyone and even the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.010
 That's where the staff is. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.720
 convalescent recovering from disease 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.150
 accident something can take eight o 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.010
 time I will not dwell too long before 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 because I'm not a nutritionist I am 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.920
 chemical training 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.979
 Yes, we study a little and the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 that we do there that we have already used and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.130
 proteins etc. 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 for all this gives a certain experience 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.880
 to talk a little bit and still in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 protein whey protein is is a food 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 extracted from milk whey and was 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.960
 divided into three categories 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.560
 you have to protect concentrate and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.540
 isolated hydrolyzed beauty 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520
 Let's get focused, Hi, to have. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.369
 focused 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.920
 it has more or less concentration of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.270
 protein at most 80% protein 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.130
 concentration're it has carbohydrates 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 she has some fat and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 concentrated protein is indicated for 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.830
 who usually to everyone 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 anyone who is doing activity 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240
 physics can and should take and own 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 concentrate is cheaper than isolated 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.340
 and categorized has a high value 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.630
 biological absolution is very fast 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.580
 It's really cool, and so is it, and it's cheap. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.850
 It's so often the guy comes here. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.380
 Is not the guy starting to train? 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.150
 22 months of training the inter- 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.190
 isolated protein 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 you do not need to protect the side can 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 get concentrated 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 the isolated so that it is only in the second 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.750
 sound was already that guy who already 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030
 It is training for some time that gives 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.489
 that defined or someone who has 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.030
 problem that lactose intolerance 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.670
 the isolated protein usually has 90 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.610
 95% protein at the concentration of 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.820
 protein on our agenda it okay 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.190
 some are zero case like this here O 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.810
 staff IntegralmÃ©dica I have a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:05.090
 wife and the cable and a lease or such 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.820
 of rone cosmo tatum proteins very good 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 in terms of price it is more expensive 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.830
 it is more expensive than the concentrated but 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.019
 so does she but not that she is not 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.180
 indicated for anyone but it is more 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.489
 indicated staff is wanting that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.590
 dried and is already training 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.790
 already has one with its muscular strength already has 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.620
 a cool muscle 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:35.220
 begins to take an isolate after the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.560
 performed hydrolyzed she is she is thus 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.810
 more expensive than the other two flavor 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.970
 She's not so good, she's not so nice. 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.120
 only that the absorption of it is very fast 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.430
 media bioavailability is very fast 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.590
 okay it is not suitable for everyone 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.160
 well she is so displayed for that 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.620
 face that is already in the phase is maximum 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.940
 she usually does not have 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.829
 no fat has no 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.470
 carbohydrates, there's nothing, it 's a 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:08.140
 protein that so in rare people 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.970
 athletes and also look for their indication 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.610
 eunice weaver but I'll tell you any 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 one of the three that you choose has a high 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.350
 biological value and the additive 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.570
 Very cool digestibility, okay? 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.170
 build muscles the way you do 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.350
 Now, another thing is one you 're talking about. 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.150
 Look, I just want to take protein because 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.750
 I do not need carbohydrate is one 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.100
 mistake 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.930
 You need carbohydrates in 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.669
 carbohydrates and muscle can not 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.950
 to do so can not take away proteins 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.740
 How do you need carbohydrate? 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.630
 so it 's the advice I give people 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.850
 stop with this business from to not only will 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.860
 take it alone I want to grow legal 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.710
 with the concentrated you will grow 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.240
 and also're conca 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.880
 What happens is that you do not have 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.360
 charge on your body when you finish 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.160
 to train is your body he goes 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.230
 start analyzing how you are pulling 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.730
 musician does not have to take where energy and 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.130
 Take the musician out so you need to 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.090
 your body begins to take 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.750
 carbohydrate and preserve your muscle 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.360
 people 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.590
 I hope I have helped you there in the glass etc. 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.690
 such 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.390
 Anything came into your page. 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.160
 On facebook, we'll meet you there. 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.979
 supplements and soon we will have 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.210
 more videos and more news there for 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.200
 you beauty 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.200
 thanks a hug
