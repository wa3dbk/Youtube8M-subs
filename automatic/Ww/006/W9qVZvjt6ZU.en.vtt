I'd share with you a little experiment I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.610 
I'd share with you a little experiment I
started<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.940> growing<00:00:12.210> things<00:00:12.620> because

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
started I like growing things because

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.220 
started I like growing things because
when<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> grow<00:00:14.130> things<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.790> eat<00:00:14.940> them

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
when you grow things you can eat them

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.019 
when you grow things you can eat them
and<00:00:16.230> unfortunately<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.220> moved<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> an

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and unfortunately I moved to an

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
and unfortunately I moved to an
apartment<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.449> couple<00:00:18.720> years<00:00:18.900> ago<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.289> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
apartment a couple years ago and you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.109 
apartment a couple years ago and you
can't<00:00:19.920> grow<00:00:20.039> anything<00:00:20.310> outside<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:20.939> no

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
can't grow anything outside there's no

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.660 
can't grow anything outside there's no
backyard<00:00:21.390> side<00:00:21.869> yard<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.740> was<00:00:23.130> terrible

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
backyard side yard which is was terrible

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.070 
backyard side yard which is was terrible
because<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.119> wonderful<00:00:24.449> dirt<00:00:24.689> outside

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
because you have wonderful dirt outside

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
because you have wonderful dirt outside
you<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.260> can't<00:00:25.529> use<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.849> and<00:00:26.849> there's<00:00:27.150> plenty

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you just can't use it and there's plenty

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.150 
you just can't use it and there's plenty
of<00:00:27.449> fresh<00:00:27.689> water<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> balcony

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
of fresh water but I do have a balcony

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.100 
of fresh water but I do have a balcony
in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.359> past<00:00:30.689> year<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> did<00:00:31.410> grow<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.040> little

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
in the past year I did grow in a little

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.950 
in the past year I did grow in a little
compost<00:00:34.110> container<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> parsley<00:00:36.329> which

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
compost container a lot of parsley which

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
compost container a lot of parsley which
I<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.350> parsley<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> grew<00:00:38.520> tons<00:00:38.820> over

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I like parsley and it grew tons over

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
I like parsley and it grew tons over
there<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.680> recently<00:00:40.680> somebody<00:00:40.920> told<00:00:41.280> me

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
there but recently somebody told me

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
there but recently somebody told me
about<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.820> could<00:00:41.969> eat<00:00:42.180> sweet<00:00:42.570> potato<00:00:42.870> greens

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
about you could eat sweet potato greens

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
about you could eat sweet potato greens
so<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> decided<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> space<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> try

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so I decided in the space I have to try

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
so I decided in the space I have to try
an<00:00:45.989> experiment<00:00:46.379> growing<00:00:47.070> sweet<00:00:47.670> potato<00:00:47.940> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
an experiment growing sweet potato for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900 
an experiment growing sweet potato for
the<00:00:48.480> greens<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> do

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the greens and and what I'm going to do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
the greens and and what I'm going to do
at<00:00:51.030> first<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.420> try<00:00:52.379> different<00:00:53.010> containers

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
at first is try different containers

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
at first is try different containers
with<00:00:53.550> different<00:00:53.910> amounts<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> nutrients<00:00:54.780> in

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
with different amounts of nutrients in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
with different amounts of nutrients in
it<00:00:55.250> also<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.460> clear<00:00:56.789> containers<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it also I have clear containers and in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
it also I have clear containers and in
non<00:00:58.469> clear<00:00:58.770> container<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> Sun

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
non clear container to see if the Sun

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
non clear container to see if the Sun
will<00:01:00.030> affect<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> root<00:01:00.570> growth<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
will affect the root growth and the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
will affect the root growth and the
amount<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.250> greens<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.000> cut<00:01:03.300> off<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> tops

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
amount of greens also I cut off the tops

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.149 
amount of greens also I cut off the tops
of<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.080> sweet<00:01:04.290> potatoes<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.830> put<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.070> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
of some sweet potatoes and put them in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
of some sweet potatoes and put them in
the<00:01:05.220> water<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.090> toothpicks<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the water put some toothpicks on the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
the water put some toothpicks on the
bottom<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:08.010> experiment<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.060> I've

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bottom as an experiment to see and I've

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
bottom as an experiment to see and I've
already<00:01:09.390> found<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.530> gonna<00:01:10.799> work

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
already found out that it is gonna work

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.250 
already found out that it is gonna work
and<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.210> rotting<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and they look like they're rotting so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.899 
and they look like they're rotting so
that's<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.950> experiment<00:01:14.520> I've<00:01:14.610> already

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that's one experiment I've already

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.490 
that's one experiment I've already
started<00:01:15.119> looks<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.780> found<00:01:16.049> something<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
started looks like I found something I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.120 
started looks like I found something I
didn't<00:01:16.830> know

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
didn't know

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.420 
didn't know
I<00:01:17.159> also<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> find<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.400> can

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I also going to find out how much I can

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.090 
I also going to find out how much I can
grow<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> different<00:01:21.479> space<00:01:21.979> with<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
grow in a different space with the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
grow in a different space with the
crowding<00:01:23.549> different<00:01:24.000> because<00:01:24.180> those

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
crowding different because those

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
crowding different because those
containers<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:25.140> 1<00:01:25.320> foot<00:01:25.500> square<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
containers about 1 foot square so I can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
containers about 1 foot square so I can
see<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.360> many<00:01:27.770> sweet<00:01:28.770> potato<00:01:29.070> plants<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
see how many sweet potato plants I can

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.340 
see how many sweet potato plants I can
get<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:31.320> course<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.159> need

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
get of course you don't really need

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
get of course you don't really need
individual<00:01:34.350> containers<00:01:34.619> I've<00:01:35.130> seen<00:01:35.369> I'm

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
individual containers I've seen I'm

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
individual containers I've seen I'm
still<00:01:35.850> working<00:01:36.150> she<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.720> sweet<00:01:37.020> potatoes

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
still working she put a sweet potatoes

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
still working she put a sweet potatoes
bunched<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> container<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:40.140> grows

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bunched up into a container and grows

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
bunched up into a container and grows
them<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.130> together<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> try

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
them all together but I want to try

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.850 
them all together but I want to try
different<00:01:42.570> nutrients<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.470> why<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> have

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
different nutrients so that's why I have

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.560 
different nutrients so that's why I have
them<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.250> containers<00:01:44.579> everybody's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
them in different containers everybody's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
them in different containers everybody's
grown<00:01:45.780> sweet<00:01:45.990> potatoes<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.439> containers<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
grown sweet potatoes in containers I
