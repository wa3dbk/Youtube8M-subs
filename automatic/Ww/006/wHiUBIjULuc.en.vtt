is Liz lower on the GI or you know that
scale<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.409> slower<00:02:01.740> digesting<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
scale it's you know slower digesting and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
scale it's you know slower digesting and
all<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.969> stuff<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.420> basically<00:02:03.840> crap<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
all that stuff is basically crap if you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.150 
all that stuff is basically crap if you
are<00:02:05.399> eating<00:02:05.909> brown<00:02:06.899> rice<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.469> white<00:02:07.680> rice<00:02:07.710> with

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
are eating brown rice or white rice with

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.360 
are eating brown rice or white rice with
any<00:02:08.429> other<00:02:08.640> type<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:08.970> food<00:02:09.410> mixed<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.590> then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
any other type of food mixed in then

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.050 
any other type of food mixed in then
whatever<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.239> rated<00:02:12.629> as

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
whatever it was rated as

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.120 
whatever it was rated as
has<00:02:13.780> absolutely<00:02:14.440> no<00:02:14.860> meaning<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:18.010> know

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
has absolutely no meaning or you know

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.290 
has absolutely no meaning or you know
really<00:02:18.340> doesn't<00:02:18.790> matter<00:02:18.910> at<00:02:19.180> all<00:02:19.239> because

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
really doesn't matter at all because

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.210 
really doesn't matter at all because
that<00:02:19.720> other<00:02:20.020> food<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.709> affect<00:02:21.040> how

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
that other food is going to affect how

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.080 
that other food is going to affect how
quickly<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.700> gets<00:02:21.790> digest<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.599> begin<00:02:22.900> anyways

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
quickly it gets digest to begin anyways

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.760 
quickly it gets digest to begin anyways
other<00:02:25.090> than<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.319> way<00:02:26.470> brown

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
other than that because of the way brown

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.630 
other than that because of the way brown
rice<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.150> know<00:02:28.239> constructed<00:02:29.640> white

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
rice is a you know constructed white

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.960 
rice is a you know constructed white
rice<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.150> becomes<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.959> better<00:02:32.970> absorbed

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
rice actually becomes a better absorbed

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.650 
rice actually becomes a better absorbed
and<00:02:34.180> more<00:02:34.900> nutrient<00:02:35.560> available<00:02:36.660> carbohydrate

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and more nutrient available carbohydrate

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.259 
and more nutrient available carbohydrate
source<00:02:38.040> yes<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.580> same<00:02:40.030> type<00:02:40.239> of

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
source yes they have the same type of

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.180 
source yes they have the same type of
nutrients<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.019> white<00:02:41.200> rice<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:42.040> it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
nutrients but white rice because it's

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.309 
nutrients but white rice because it's
easier<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.580> be<00:02:42.670> broken<00:02:43.030> down<00:02:43.150> by<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.450> body<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
easier to be broken down by the body the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.470 
easier to be broken down by the body the
body<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.709> able<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.069> absorb<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.610> more<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.330> get

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
body is able to absorb it more you get

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.180 
body is able to absorb it more you get
more<00:02:46.750> nutrients<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.440> actually<00:02:47.739> benefit

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
more nutrients and you actually benefit

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.620 
more nutrients and you actually benefit
from<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.610> more<00:02:48.819> than<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.239> were<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.569> to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
from it more than if you were going to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.500 
from it more than if you were going to
consume<00:02:49.989> brown<00:02:50.319> rice<00:02:50.970> another<00:02:51.970> big<00:02:52.239> issue

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
consume brown rice another big issue

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.500 
consume brown rice another big issue
with<00:02:52.900> brown<00:02:53.140> rice<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.250> shell<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.299> one

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
with brown rice is the shell that one

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.620 
with brown rice is the shell that one
actually<00:02:55.750> gives<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.590> brown<00:02:57.160> color<00:02:57.630> causes

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
actually gives it the brown color causes

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.960 
actually gives it the brown color causes
a<00:02:58.660> lot<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.140> people<00:02:59.410> digestion<00:03:00.069> issues<00:03:00.730> and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
a lot of people digestion issues and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.970 
a lot of people digestion issues and
they<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:01.840> even<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
they don't even know that that's the the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.289 
they don't even know that that's the the
problem<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.340> they're<00:03:03.549> getting<00:03:03.670> because<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
problem that they're getting because to

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.539 
problem that they're getting because to
them<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:05.110> know<00:03:05.200> rice<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.709> rice<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:05.950> rice<00:03:06.310> is

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
them you know rice is rice and rice is

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.910 
them you know rice is rice and rice is
healthy<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.209> brown<00:03:07.989> rice<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.410> knock<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.620> out<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
healthy so brown rice we knock it out a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.710 
healthy so brown rice we knock it out a
lot<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.400> people's<00:03:09.700> digestion<00:03:10.150> issues

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
lot of people's digestion issues

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.910 
lot of people's digestion issues
especially<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.290> they're<00:03:11.440> taking<00:03:11.739> high

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
especially if they're taking high

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.500 
especially if they're taking high
amounts<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.310> carbs<00:03:12.640> on<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:12.910> high<00:03:13.060> carb<00:03:13.330> days

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
amounts of carbs on like high carb days

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
amounts of carbs on like high carb days
really<00:03:14.380> seem<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.950> disappear

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
really seem to just disappear

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.460 
really seem to just disappear
another<00:03:17.530> reason<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.519> shell<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
another reason is that shell that the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.310 
another reason is that shell that the
brown<00:03:20.680> rice<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:22.299> body<00:03:22.570> actually<00:03:22.870> tries

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
brown rice is in the body actually tries

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.590 
brown rice is in the body actually tries
to<00:03:23.500> treat<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.980> like<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.220> gluten<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.030> if

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
to treat that like a gluten and if

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.090 
to treat that like a gluten and if
you've<00:03:25.750> ever<00:03:25.870> kind<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.440> looked<00:03:26.590> around<00:03:26.799> about

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
you've ever kind of looked around about

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.640 
you've ever kind of looked around about
how<00:03:27.310> gluten<00:03:28.030> affects<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.750> body<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.440> all<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
how gluten affects the body and all the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.229 
how gluten affects the body and all the
negative<00:03:30.040> things<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.340> can<00:03:30.549> happen<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:31.060> it

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
negative things that can happen with it

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.059 
negative things that can happen with it
it's<00:03:31.900> something<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.620> really<00:03:32.650> want<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
it's something that you really want to

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.220 
it's something that you really want to
try<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.280> avoid<00:03:33.489> or<00:03:33.940> minimize<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:35.079> you've

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
try to avoid or minimize and if you've

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.289 
try to avoid or minimize and if you've
ever<00:03:35.319> gone<00:03:35.650> gluten-free<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> week<00:03:36.970> or<00:03:37.150> two

that's actually going to block that

that's actually going to block that
those<00:04:16.750> nutrients<00:04:17.260> from<00:04:17.380> getting<00:04:17.709> absorbed

those nutrients from getting absorbed
into<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.639> body<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.030> not<00:04:19.959> only<00:04:20.410> is<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.950> easier

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
acid like brown rice does and so you're

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.420 
acid like brown rice does and so you're
actually<00:04:31.960> able<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.230> absorb<00:04:32.740> all<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> minerals

actually able to absorb all the minerals

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.130 
actually able to absorb all the minerals
and<00:04:33.550> vitamins<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.360> right<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.900> white

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
and vitamins that the right that white

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.650 
and vitamins that the right that white
rice<00:04:35.350> provides<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.760> you're<00:04:36.910> getting<00:04:37.150> maximum

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660
