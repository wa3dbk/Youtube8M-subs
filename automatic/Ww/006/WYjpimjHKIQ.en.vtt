00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
having some random guys card on ultimate
team<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.410> they<00:02:28.530> would<00:02:28.650> make<00:02:28.800> their<00:02:28.830> like

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.070 
team but then they would make their like
to<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.660> had<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.050> really

to this that so if they had like really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.690 
to this that so if they had like really
poor<00:02:31.620> shooting<00:02:31.830> obviously<00:02:32.370> there'd<00:02:32.520> be<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
poor shooting obviously there'd be a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.460 
poor shooting obviously there'd be a
broaden<00:02:33.090> San<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.390> how<00:02:33.780> cool<00:02:34.050> would<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.290> be

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
broaden San that how cool would that be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
they should probably do that it's like

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.040 
they should probably do that it's like
an<00:02:46.319> idea<00:02:46.800> where<00:02:47.069> oh<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.910> gel<00:02:48.090> end<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.569> it's

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
like an idea where it will probably be

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.420
