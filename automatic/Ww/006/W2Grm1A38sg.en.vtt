00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
close if anything there's a little total

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
close if anything there's a little total
suppression<00:02:17.060> with<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.380> would<00:02:18.470> be<00:02:18.500> so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
suppression with this but it would be so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.080 
suppression with this but it would be so
hard<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.950> hear<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> resonator<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.970> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
hard to hear on a resonator that it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.090 
hard to hear on a resonator that it
wouldn't<00:02:20.360> wouldn't<00:02:20.630> matter<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.560> really
