with<00:01:06.219> squat<00:01:06.549> exercise<00:01:06.719> many<00:01:07.719> athletes<00:01:08.229> will

with squat exercise many athletes will

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.129 
with squat exercise many athletes will
only<00:01:08.649> do<00:01:08.939> 250<00:01:09.939> pounds<00:01:10.389> at<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.689> beginning<00:01:11.079> of

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 
only do 250 pounds at the beginning of

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:14.399 
only do 250 pounds at the beginning of
the<00:01:11.259> exercise<00:01:11.799> but<00:01:12.429> could<00:01:12.789> do<00:01:13.030> 900<00:01:13.479> pounds<00:01:14.289> in

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
the exercise but could do 900 pounds in

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.129 
the exercise but could do 900 pounds in
the<00:01:14.649> last<00:01:14.920> 2<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.579> 3<00:01:15.609> inches<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.539> exercise

the last 2 to 3 inches of that exercise

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.300

thus<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.520> weights<00:01:18.819> one<00:01:19.450> would<00:01:19.689> only<00:01:19.719> lift

thus with weights one would only lift

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.399 
thus with weights one would only lift
250<00:01:21.310> pounds<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.880> get<00:01:22.270> little<00:01:22.689> resistance<00:01:23.259> at
