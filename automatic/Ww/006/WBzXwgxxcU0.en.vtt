00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
score it's about twenty to thirty kills
more<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.359> anyone<00:01:00.719> else<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:01.020> already<00:01:01.109> gotten

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
more than anyone else has already gotten

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
more than anyone else has already gotten
so<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> gives<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.489> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so that kind of gives you a little you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.039 
so that kind of gives you a little you
know<00:01:02.820> guideline<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> how<00:01:03.629> many<00:01:03.690> kills<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
know guideline to how many kills I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
know guideline to how many kills I
really<00:01:04.290> did<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.939> score

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
really did get but I think that score

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
really did get but I think that score
probably<00:01:06.420> won't<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.630> beaten<00:01:06.900> until<00:01:07.430> ground

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
probably won't be beaten until ground

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
probably won't be beaten until ground

missed the days where all you have to do

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
missed the days where all you have to do
is<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.920> 100<00:01:38.430> headshots<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> gold

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
is get 100 headshots and you get a gold

is get 100 headshots and you get a gold
gun<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.829> game<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:41.460> even

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
gun you know in this game I don't even

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
gun you know in this game I don't even
think<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.060> yeah<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.960> there

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
think that yeah I don't think so there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
think that yeah I don't think so there
is<00:01:43.500> no<00:01:43.710> requirement<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.430> headshots<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
is no requirement for headshots to get a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
is no requirement for headshots to get a
gold<00:01:45.540> gun<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.960> game<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:47.100> most<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gold gun in this game I think most of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.340 
gold gun in this game I think most of
them<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> similar<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> black<00:01:48.930> ops<00:01:49.170> 2

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
them are kind of similar to black ops 2

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
them are kind of similar to black ops 2
requirements<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.369> after<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
requirements you know after you you know

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.490 
requirements you know after you you know
in<00:01:51.299> black<00:01:51.450> ops<00:01:51.600> 2<00:01:51.720> after<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.079> those<00:01:52.170> 100

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
in black ops 2 after you got those 100

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
in black ops 2 after you got those 100
headshots<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.369> gave<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.820> 10<00:01:54.180> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
headshots they gave you like 10 like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
headshots they gave you like 10 like
weird-ass<00:01:54.810> challenges<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.470> had<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
weird-ass challenges you had to get and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
weird-ass challenges you had to get and
then<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.030> gun<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.659> gun<00:01:57.840> gold

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then you get your gun your gun gold

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
then you get your gun your gun gold
basically<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> game<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.909> got<00:02:00.030> rid<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
basically in this game they got rid of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.609 
basically in this game they got rid of
the<00:02:00.360> hundred<00:02:00.630> headshots<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.469> give

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the hundred headshots and they just give

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.109 
the hundred headshots and they just give
you<00:02:01.649> those<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.009> 10<00:02:02.219> weird-ass<00:02:02.579> challenges

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
you those like 10 weird-ass challenges

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.550 
you those like 10 weird-ass challenges
and<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.170> normal

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and some of them are normal

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.859 
and some of them are normal
some<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> them<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.340> kind<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> stupid<00:02:06.479> really

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
some of them are kind of stupid really

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.839 
some of them are kind of stupid really
the<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> most<00:02:08.729> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the one I really don't like the most is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.460 
the one I really don't like the most is
the<00:02:08.970> leaning<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.840> basically<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the leaning one so basically you have to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
the leaning one so basically you have to
get<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> hundred<00:02:11.009> leaning<00:02:11.580> kills<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.540> order

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
get a hundred leaning kills in order

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.980 
get a hundred leaning kills in order
it's<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> challenges

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
it's one of the challenges

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.260 
it's one of the challenges
my<00:02:14.290> gold<00:02:14.530> camo<00:02:14.860> another<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.120> to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
my gold camo another one is you have to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.510 
my gold camo another one is you have to
get<00:02:16.540> 15<00:02:17.110> sliding<00:02:17.770> kills<00:02:18.040> which<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.460> don't

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
get 15 sliding kills which I don't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.220 
get 15 sliding kills which I don't
really<00:02:18.700> slide<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.120> don't<00:02:19.540> really<00:02:19.660> lean<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
really slide I don't really lean so

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.720 
really slide I don't really lean so
those<00:02:20.440> are<00:02:20.560> both<00:02:20.650> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> annoying<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
those are both kind of annoying the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.040 
those are both kind of annoying the
longshot<00:02:22.180> one<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.480> also<00:02:22.690> kind<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.930> knowing

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
longshot one is also kind of knowing

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.630 
longshot one is also kind of knowing
because<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.380> have<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.680> 40<00:02:24.070> long<00:02:24.280> shots

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
because you have to get 40 long shots

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.800 
because you have to get 40 long shots
you<00:02:24.910> know<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.120> had<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.390> black<00:02:25.540> ops<00:02:25.690> 2

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
you know they had that in black ops 2

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.960 
you know they had that in black ops 2
was<00:02:25.990> like<00:02:26.140> ten<00:02:26.440> tens<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.520> hard<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:27.910> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
was like ten tens out that hard but you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.760 
was like ten tens out that hard but you
have<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.240> 40<00:02:28.690> long<00:02:28.900> shots<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.560> takes

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
have to get 40 long shots that takes

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.660 
have to get 40 long shots that takes
quite<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.010> bit<00:02:30.480> there's<00:02:31.480> 150<00:02:32.320> crouched<00:02:32.770> 150

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
quite a bit there's 150 crouched 150

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.000 
quite a bit there's 150 crouched 150
with<00:02:33.790> no<00:02:33.910> attachments<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.990> there's<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.770> few

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
with no attachments and there's a few

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.710 
with no attachments and there's a few
more<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.550> think<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> main<00:02:37.120> ones<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.570> I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
more but I think the main ones that I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.480 
more but I think the main ones that I
didn't<00:02:37.990> like<00:02:38.110> were<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.530> long<00:02:38.740> shots<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
didn't like were the long shots the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.060 
didn't like were the long shots the
leaning<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.210> sliding<00:02:40.570> because<00:02:41.530> those

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
leaning and the sliding because those

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.170 
leaning and the sliding because those

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
are things that you kind of have to go

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.050 
are things that you kind of have to go
out<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.540> your<00:02:43.570> way<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> go<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.530> get<00:02:44.710> and
