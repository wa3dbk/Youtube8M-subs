00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.969 
to be the projectile of this so-called

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.069 
repellent maybe it'll be sunscreen we
all<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.250> avoid<00:01:59.490> getting<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.969> sunburn<00:02:00.329> well

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
all can avoid getting a sunburn well

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.800 
all can avoid getting a sunburn well
that<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.409> nice<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> series

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that would be nice so as for the series

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
that would be nice so as for the series
itself<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.979> coming<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.460> right

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
itself will have a can coming up right

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.410 
itself will have a can coming up right
around<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.680> already<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.420> well

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
around here if it's not already up well

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.580 
around here if it's not already up well
i'm<00:02:09.869> guessing<00:02:10.319> sting<00:02:10.560> firing<00:02:10.860> some

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
i'm guessing sting firing some

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.699 
i'm guessing sting firing some
spray<00:02:12.190> or<00:02:12.700> stream<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.510> something<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
spray or stream of something but it

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.670 
spray or stream of something but it
comes<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.040> three<00:02:15.069> point<00:02:15.519> eight<00:02:15.610> if<00:02:15.910> 3.8<00:02:16.810> fluid

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
comes in three point eight if 3.8 fluid

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.309 
comes in three point eight if 3.8 fluid
ounces<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.879> liquid<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:20.019> guessing

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
ounces of this liquid and I'm guessing

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.729 
ounces of this liquid and I'm guessing
it<00:02:20.410> will<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.650> pressurized<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.849> can<00:02:22.000> spread

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
it will be pressurized so you can spread

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.369 
it will be pressurized so you can spread
so<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:24.459> will<00:02:24.580> come<00:02:24.730> out<00:02:24.849> in<00:02:24.910> fall<00:02:25.209> 2015<00:02:25.660> these

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
so it will come out in fall 2015 these

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.309 
so it will come out in fall 2015 these
cans<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.040> 599<00:02:27.849> each<00:02:28.090> which<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.690> quite

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
cans will be 599 each which is quite

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.470 
cans will be 599 each which is quite
pricey<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> hope<00:02:30.400> these<00:02:30.580> things<00:02:30.640> last<00:02:31.120> long

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
pricey so I hope these things last long

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.660 
pricey so I hope these things last long
