00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.230
 possible excuse to send there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 There are no people in Libya 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.710
 administrative management not even 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.750
 state power in a country of chaos and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 the question is why after the military 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 interventions that happened more 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.910
 three years ago, no one thought about 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 what next 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 today we need to fix yesterday 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 mistakes europe faced immigration 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 crisis thousands of people flee 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 European countries and captured 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.939
 conflicts north africa against this background 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 the European Union is discussing a military operation 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.909
 against carriers illegal in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.250

 in Brussels the foreign minister and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
 EU Minister of Defense 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.110
 agreed on a plan to deal with carriers 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.579
 illegal migrants item one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 reveal here used to 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.020
 transportation of illegal immigrants item second 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 don't let them leave the Libyan waters 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 point 3 do away with business 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 carriers are hard to imagine how 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.780
 can perform the last item not 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 engaging ground troops on 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.430
 last week head of foreign policy 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.229
 EU authorities Federica mogerini said 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.360
 that ground offensive operation on 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.280
 Libyan territory is completely excluded 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 however, a leak has recently occurred 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.509
 information and it became known that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 the possibility of placing ground troops in 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 Libya was discussed at a high level in 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.649
 2011, Libya turned 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.100
 transfer point from where migrants 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.380
 smuggle in the midst of the earth 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.960
 sea ​​to europe go to this dangerous 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.430
 tens of thousands of people have already decided 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.650
 many of them died 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.740
 This situation developed after the overthrow 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.990
 Libyan government in 2011 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.150
 I believe many European ministers 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.070
 defense and foreign affairs are now 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.210
 support new measures to combat 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.890
 illegal migration 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.200
 did not expect to be in such 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.580
 fix when helped 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 overthrow Colonel Gaddafi
