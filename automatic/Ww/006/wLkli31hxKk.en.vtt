00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.970
 hello and friends this is special 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.240
 video tutorial on how to create a shortcut 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.980
 games 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 if you allowed it to be installed on 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.230
 you have your hard drive 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 firmware freeboot xbox 360m and you are not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 already know how to set a shortcut 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.660
 some of you probably have such 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 I didn't even have a problem 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 faced such a problem 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 Well, thank God I decided it myself because 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.380
 that I couldn't find anything on the internet 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.690
 Like this and let's get started here we are 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.170
 have opened 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.739
 opened our rowing wish games 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:49.140
 let 's say we are now 60 and will 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:53.190
 we leave we go means the conductor here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:01.020
 ours is our hard drive or days 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 against push further content sonny and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 the very bottom let's say it's all with us already 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.659
 there are games in our content with someone 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 maybe games 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.450
 but me in context and that is here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 let's take our without 2015 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 that is, if there is no label then you are manually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.350
 run and through this file here is a-32 5 and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.270
 so forth i mean he click 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.570
 goes down as a matter of fact 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.829
 create a shortcut if you don't have it then 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.470
 eat i hope you understand me that is 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.829
 Come on let's say you are watching the game 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.259
 let's say fifteen we have no well he 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.220
 I have because I have already done it 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.509
 you have it let this label 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.079
 install a disk box on it and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.210
 run everything manually through hard language 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.010
 everything will show 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.400
 So we go in the settings further 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.290
 setting content and paths to 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.270
 content 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.930
 Click and here we have the default 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.310
 depth scan 2 we click on 5 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.050
 and click on the cross already save all here 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 we went to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.560
 that is, the floor will be a little longer but 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 but all 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.060
 scans all our games that is here on 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.610
 path specified 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:29.209
 hdd here is content 000 here to these ways 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 that is, it takes time and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.430
 Essentially everything is now when he considers the wheels 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 if you have these shortcuts 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.860
 naturally it was not the default 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.190
 under then you need to download the cover 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.670
 if your internet is connected via 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.380
 let's say wifi or via lan cable well 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.600
 and I default by default again 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.040
 all come back as I was on 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.230
 scan initially so on 2 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.260
 I am again saving that is how fast 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.370
 carina 2 will scan us all this 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.130
 here he scanned everything 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.019
 and all the farther we need to do it 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.660
 go to the library of games and here we have 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.660
 our shortcut will appear i.e. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.459
 find him now i will find him in 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.020
 In this case, I had a screen without 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.270
 fifteen here it is that is all 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.790
 I hope I helped someone thanks for
