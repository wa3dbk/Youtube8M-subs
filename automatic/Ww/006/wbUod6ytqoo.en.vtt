00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.109
 Hello 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.350
 serious games for adults know 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 all people dream that what and oh yes of course 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.849
 not all because of the recent 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 tax on dreams not everyone has become 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.090
 pocket 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.759
 but as for me I always dreamed about 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.800
 the universe where giant powerful 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 dinosaurs fight each other with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.020
 using lasers it would be cool and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.840
 raking fan mail I stumbled upon 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.890

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.290

 but don't worry i won't tell anyone plus 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.270
 it is legal in at least 12 countries 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 a list of which on the contrary as if there 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 I will do a review on the driver in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 dinosaur 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 there dinosaurs with big laser 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.439
 cannons are oppressed by people from the future 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.900
 your life 2 you are an insignificant piece 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.640
 human trash signature rum 12 years 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 taganrog oh, these fans really 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.049
 well friend uncle commander always 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.290
 listens to its viewers so 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.570
 get ready for truly prehistoric 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.250
 traveling in this historically scientific 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.250
 dinosaur cartoon 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.329
 dinosaur drivers begins with 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.369
 why are all the other kind of films 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.000
 a team of main characters flying in space 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.500
 but their attack evil cosmic I schA it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.049
 i wrote something on a jim worm level 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.729
 okay good guys who of course 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.830
 same people because people always 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 goodies in these cartoons 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.870
 want to use some kind of your crazy 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 cool time engine to run away but 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.180
 their ship is damaged so everything goes no 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.819
 as it should, well, complements the picture 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.910
 that the lizards or as they are called roland and 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.670
 hooked on their type of capture ray so 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.209
 both ships are sent for millions of years 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.370
 past and landing people first 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.709
 meet dinosaurs but you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.440
 you know, they were everywhere in those years 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.549
 dinosaur then dinosaur here and everything 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.769
 don't give a damn but I just can't resist 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.069
 zatsenit reaction protagonist and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.920
 collected and so what are we looking forward to 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:59.250
 intelligence went I have one little idea 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.829
 about this in general the bottom line is that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 people have cool amulets allowing them 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.870
 communicate with dinosaurs so they 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.579
 fossil friends with them quickly 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.519
 the moment becomes true for people 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.140
 psami than they immediately use pinned 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.750
 they are gigantic laser guns 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.120
 space lizards do about the same 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.459
 most only instead of friendship they 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.829
 use mind control though at the very 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.410
 really if you look from the side 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.660
 thereâ€™s no difference 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.540
 make dinosaurs fight each other 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.720
 friend so i don't see what people do 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.620
 any better than rogans and this 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.959
 just about everything 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.989
 how much does the movie go there that is absolutely 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.900
 seriously this is all that happens in this 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.660
 cartoon day of all 13 episodes in each 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.850
 of which they are like fighting each other 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.280
 well or sometimes roland come up 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.109
 some tricky plan and and they type 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.109
 fight a little harder 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.340
 but roughly speaking everything that happens in 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.319
 this cartoon of this series is all people of us 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.810
 shoot each other with lasers 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.000
 there is no fact in it even the plot 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.099
 really funny how drovers 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.860
 dinosaurs are brazenly advertising 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.640
 toys it is even written on wikipedia 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.760
 first lines 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.280
 this cartoon is nothing but battles 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.560
 laser dinosaurs and ok it's pretty 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.519
 cool by itself but very fast 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.280
 annoying 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.740
 have any even the coolest action 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.780
 which by the way is not that very cool 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.050
 here but he should still be 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.990
 background and more difficult than I want to collect 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.720
 the largest army of dinosaur therefore 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.270
 drovers look but very boring well 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.150
 there is another factor alone action 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.729
 sometimes made like a damn documentary 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.080
 in fact, they so much stipulate the details 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.330
 what can go mad 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.460
 and some series look like 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.460
 real battlefield records 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.580
 laser dinosaurs can actually fall asleep 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.800
 all my life I have been searching for such a universe from 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.590
 dudes all messed up talking about 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.340
 what kind of awesome toys can kids 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.770
 ask my parents for my devil 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.630
 the search continues oh well 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.850
 next time let's take a look at 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.270
 anything more modern here 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.280
 zadolbala already watch this junk 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.860
 check out the joke modern because 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.860
 here this bridge was about fossil fast 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.740
 multiplication 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.340
 I know 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.700
