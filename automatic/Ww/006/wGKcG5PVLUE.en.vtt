00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello friends with you screamer pulled 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 warframe is very little extra 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.990
 weapons that can make you happy 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 having reached the thirtieth level film and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.560
 leaving the catalyst essie korus 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 prime one of them I honestly was 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 surprised enough by his power 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 it is not necessary any more clearly it is not necessary 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 catalyst and I am pleased that they write about him 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.810
 all to 1 turns out turns on 3 shots 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 that provides a balance between 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.780
 automatic and deadly deadliness 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 semi automatic pistols 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.510
 honestly i used a cigar myself 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.840
 the usual version and I liked him then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 it was at the very beginning and was actually 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.070
 bad 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.500
 but let's go gear 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.609
 here it is apparently not so much in principle 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 and high damage modules on it are worth it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 such a wonderful gun at the leopard double 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 trunk and deadly line polarization at 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 he is and it pleases 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.060
 tick went to battle well we have found 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.439
 first enemies on pluto 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.979
 twenty sixth level no you don't 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.549
 surprised i'm surprised and from just the axis 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 I did not expect this wheel 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:38.189
 principle you can with a single click on 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:44.369
 mouse button to kill one enemy well, 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 if creed drops 2 1 immediately remember 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.180
 more precisely 6 because it is deadly 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 shower 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.759
 I have now in the course once again and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.829
 beat to me killed cheers me honestly 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.479
 saying such an opinion about 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:08.140
 the rule of law is that it is the most powerful 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 the game apart from some of the lab 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.680
 here we see make-up twenty-eighth 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.459
 level 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:24.350
 Russian look and they fall like 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.190
 prostitutes from the tough guy where now 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.600
 there was a marker 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:35.569
 and this is not a ball where you bitch confidently us 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.340
 not hard enough but still possible and 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.010
 to kill 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.030
 punish rape all the media you can 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.910
 do with one trigger pull 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 all but the bombers are falling and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.120
 flamethrowers almost always 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.630
 like this 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.030
 Again, I repeat it is not worth it 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 catalyst and you can conclude 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.219
 should I not bet on it 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.510
 put 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:23.609
 if you honestly put the fact that rarely 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.609
 what weapon is so powerful 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:39.489

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:45.549

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:47.909

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:15.730

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.949
