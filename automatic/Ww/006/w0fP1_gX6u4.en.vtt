00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.359
 video today I will show you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 quite simply the avenger corridor 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.810
 I can totally switch off completely 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.699
 that some of you hate it when it does 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.640
 all the time any abbreviation 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 whatever corrected and that's why 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.070
 I'll tell you that it will be now 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 relatively short video but it will be you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 Certainly help for the first time 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.899
 settings 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 we can all the way down go to yes 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.090
 language input i have seen on fourth 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.219
 below user languages ​​input comes 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 Of course , to which mobile phone you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 have so there you do that first 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.379
 right examination out then you go here 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.289
 on the settings of the android 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.930
 Keyboard shown again so easy 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.470
 click on it or on it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 press and then you'll see right here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.310
 the language input you can 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 off when you then even after 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.610
 passes it to thrust spices also lock 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.860
 figure out auto-correction on then 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 Never show change suggestions 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 yes and there is more 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 attitudes and that the contacts 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.650
 I would suggest putting out 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.659
 Change of language and pointless blank 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:40.610
 That would have been almost 100 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.280
 make a big cool spelling out 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 Personally , it does not bother me then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 can you give the birth language input 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.780
 must also turn off course 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.940
 Not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.430
 yes and it would have been then already 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.979
 so of course he is another 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:08.750
 keyboard have the ezb from the place gate 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:11.450
 you know, it's just that there 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 other storms now apply to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.370
 for example quite spontaneous swiftkey 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.319
 installed very briefly 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.960
 In any case, this tour 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.090
 otherwise there is also the keyboard is 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.320
 of course no advertising for that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.030
 no but it depends on which 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.550
 keyboard flexi uses no idea 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.220
 in any case in the settings 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.730
 under language input under android 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.410
 keyboard can you like the autocorrection 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 make out and the show 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.930
 Although disable spelling here 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.880
 So of course, only the start button 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.110
 Many others have shown guilt 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.730
 has is obviously different here is just 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.630
 look for yourself so that would be it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.630
 have been 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:31.820
 yes I hope you like the video and
