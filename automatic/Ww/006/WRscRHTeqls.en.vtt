we're going to do a Auto vacuum and seal
see<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> air<00:01:34.259> being<00:01:34.469> pulled<00:01:34.770> out

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.260 

now<00:01:47.370> it's<00:01:47.550> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> ceiling<00:01:48.030> cycle

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.000 

so<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.440> regular<00:01:55.830> back

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
so there we are it's just a regular back

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.930 
so there we are it's just a regular back
pocket<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.940> we<00:01:57.720> do<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.230> with<00:01:58.610> roles<00:01:59.610> that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
pocket and we do that with roles that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.450 
pocket and we do that with roles that
can<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.150> criticized<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:01.080> various<00:02:01.950> sizes<00:02:02.370> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
can be criticized for various sizes of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.870 
can be criticized for various sizes of
precut<00:02:02.940> bags<00:02:03.680> alright<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
precut bags alright but then this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.030 
precut bags alright but then this
machine<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.750> also<00:02:07.100> vacuum<00:02:08.100> in<00:02:08.600> containers<00:02:09.600> so

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
machine can also vacuum in containers so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.800 
machine can also vacuum in containers so
the<00:02:11.040> chef's<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> product<00:02:12.600> on<00:02:12.690> the

the chef's can put the product on the
vacuum<00:02:13.200> put<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.520> fridge<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
vacuum put it in it in the fridge in a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.480 
vacuum put it in it in the fridge in a
container<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:16.350> when<00:02:16.530> he's<00:02:16.680> ready<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> use<00:02:17.280> it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
container for when he's ready to use it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.660 
container for when he's ready to use it
but<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.290> will<00:02:19.710> do<00:02:19.950> something<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
but then it will do something that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.140 
but then it will do something that
machine<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.880> has<00:02:24.120> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
machine does of this this has this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.760 
machine does of this this has this
amazing<00:02:24.840> facility<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:26.640> replicate<00:02:27.410> what<00:02:28.410> chef

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
amazing facility to replicate what chef

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.050

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
with tika paste and you can see how far

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.159 
with tika paste and you can see how far
the<00:04:36.560> tika<00:04:36.919> paste<00:04:37.160> has<00:04:37.400> been<00:04:37.640> drawn<00:04:38.390> into<00:04:39.020> the

the tika paste has been drawn into the
into<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.919> flesh<00:04:41.560> now<00:04:42.560> what<00:04:42.770> chef<00:04:43.250> would<00:04:43.430> do

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
into the flesh now what chef would do

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.390 
into the flesh now what chef would do
now<00:04:43.850> is<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.810> fried<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.320> off<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:46.220> three

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
now is just fried that off to three

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400 
now is just fried that off to three
minutes<00:04:46.760> each<00:04:46.880> side<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:48.020> we've<00:04:48.140> got<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
minutes each side and we've got the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.360 
minutes each side and we've got the
equip<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.770> 12<00:04:49.130> hour<00:04:49.340> marinade

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
equip a 12 hour marinade

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.820 
equip a 12 hour marinade
so<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.960> jumbo<00:04:52.960> backpacker<00:04:53.440> machine

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
so this is the jumbo backpacker machine
