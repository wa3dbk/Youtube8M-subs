could<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:20.369> classed<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.029> maybe<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:22.320> bit

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
could be classed as maybe a little bit

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.089 
could be classed as maybe a little bit
more<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.510> sort<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> DJ<00:00:24.990> who<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> certain

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
more for the sort of DJ who to a certain

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.730 
more for the sort of DJ who to a certain
degree<00:00:26.130> knows<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> beat<00:00:27.390> much<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.560> maybe

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
degree knows how to beat much but maybe

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
degree knows how to beat much but maybe
once<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.340> little<00:00:29.519> bit<00:00:29.760> better<00:00:29.939> now

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
once you get that little bit better now

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.250 
once you get that little bit better now
mainly<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.099> about<00:00:32.640> using<00:00:33.270> your<00:00:33.750> finger

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
don't expect to get this perfectly in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.960 
don't expect to get this perfectly in
beat<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:02.119> about<00:02:03.020> trying<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:04.009> keep<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.700> in

slightly forward it doesn't matter but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.479 
slightly forward it doesn't matter but
put<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:11.989> way<00:02:12.200> if<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.860> beat<00:02:13.070> should<00:02:13.340> be

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
put it this way if the beat should be

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.390 
put it this way if the beat should be
here<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.510> there<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.140> you're<00:02:15.680> maybe<00:02:15.950> here

use my finger to keep it in beat

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.949 
use my finger to keep it in beat
basically<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.459> there's<00:02:40.640> no<00:02:40.970> power<00:02:41.299> on<00:02:41.600> the
