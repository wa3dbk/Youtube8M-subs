00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
to do a shifting video so we're going to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.730

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
speedometer gets up to 45 that's

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.870 
speedometer gets up to 45 that's
actually<00:00:18.260> 50<00:00:18.619> miles<00:00:18.860> an<00:00:19.100> hour<00:00:19.220> because<00:00:19.640> the

speedometer cable is still attached to
the<00:00:21.710> Allison<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.430> that's<00:00:22.580> in<00:00:22.820> Drive<00:00:23.570> which<00:00:24.140> is

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
the Allison and that's in Drive which is
