then you can go and mine it and then you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
then you can go and mine it and then you
can<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> caffeine<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.829> make<00:00:41.040> more<00:00:41.280> liquid

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
making an actual base another one I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
making an actual base another one I
really<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.390> suggest<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.439> kW<00:01:34.979> rocketry

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
really would suggest is this kW rocketry

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.569 
really would suggest is this kW rocketry
it<00:01:35.939> will<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> stars<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.710> stars

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it will get you to the stars if stars

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
it will get you to the stars if stars
were<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> part<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> game<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.780> could<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.020> each

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
were a part of a game you could get each

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590 
were a part of a game you could get each
of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> stars<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
of the stars it's that good but for the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
of the stars it's that good but for the
sake<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.350> already<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> kW<00:01:44.159> akka

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
sake of this I already have the kW akka

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.469 
sake of this I already have the kW akka
G<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
G I don't really want to have to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
G I don't really want to have to
download<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.470> again<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.040> we're<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
download it again so we're just going to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.109 
download it again so we're just going to
do<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.149> Kerbal<00:01:48.509> attachment<00:01:48.840> system

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
do the Kerbal attachment system

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.280 
do the Kerbal attachment system
something<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.360> note<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> might<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.200> to

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
need to do to install your mod now I'm

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.310 
need to do to install your mod now I'm
going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.950> load<00:04:48.880> up<00:04:48.910> my<00:04:49.300> friends<00:04:49.930> Kerbal<00:04:50.290> space

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
going to load up my friends Kerbal space

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.950 
going to load up my friends Kerbal space
program<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.330> probably<00:04:52.570> gonna<00:04:52.660> cut<00:04:52.870> off

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
program and I probably gonna cut off

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.070 
program and I probably gonna cut off
here<00:04:53.140> cuz<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.380> takes<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.620> nice<00:04:53.890> amount<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.430> time

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
here cuz it takes a nice amount of time

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.530 
here cuz it takes a nice amount of time
ok<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.500> as<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.070> can<00:04:57.190> see<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.790> has<00:04:58.000> just
