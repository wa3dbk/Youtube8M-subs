00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.870
 capturing our national team and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.320

 of the cbf so that you and your 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.060

 the amount of $ 568 million more

 or less nearly or more or better than 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.250
 1 billion reais 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.320
 in this period that was quoted from 2011 to 2026 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 only in this year and 2013 the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.210
 selection with the North American company 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.340

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.110
 for next year world cup year 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 were planned approximately 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.540
 90 million is a lot of money for sure 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.350
 I will not go into the merits of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.990
 partnerships 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.390
 after account our selection beyond 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 representative in Brazilian sport is 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.159
 a highly valuable product and no one 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.090
 doubts the doubts and the president 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.030
 are other 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.800
 last Saturday the press company of the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.229
 rio de janeiro reported that the president 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.060
 da cbf josé maria marin is 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.460
 dissatisfied with the amounts paid by the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.260
 nike the Brazilian team and he speaks 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.100
 including the need to review the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.350
 contract 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.860
 now considering that the team canarinho 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.020
 not the exclusive brand of cbf but the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.220
 representation of our country in events 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.229
 international 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.729
 we need to know the contract to which the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.710
 sea lord refers to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.500
 after all we are talking about an equity 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.379
 of the country whose business is carried 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.780
 name must be transparent what it says 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.610
 the agreement between cbf nike that does not 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.890
 satisfies the marine president who 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.870
 clauses guarantees the questioning of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.180
 use the values ​​of this partnership 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.450
 we are not talking about the support of a 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.640
 company a team 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.860
 we are talking about relations of 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.989
 sponsorship with a multinational that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.209
 exploits valuable advertising spaces 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.069
 in uniform of the Brazilian national team 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.980
 one of the most outstanding teams in the world of 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.160
 Not only does this use symbols 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.680
 how do you flag the flowers the anthem and 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.300
 mainly the human material ours 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 soccer player 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.310
 I imagine that a relationship of this level 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.709
 contract is agreed upon through the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
 specialists and therefore are paid 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.930
 generous commissions 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 I believe that's what I want 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.980
 request here from public sir 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.269
 cbf to express himself / herself to the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.099
 respect of the declarations of its 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.120
 President because he is so 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.519
 dissatisfied 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.870
 in case of business including remuneration 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.060
 with other partnerships 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.459
 who benefits that benefits from the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.380
 market commission as a sum of these 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.730
 commissions in the last five years 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.790
 these figures are shown in the balance sheet 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.870
 a year ago when the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.849
 upload to cbf 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.950
 the lord your husband came the commission of 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.370
 tourism and sports of this house 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.410
 on that occasion, in response to the invitation 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.709
 I expressed support and confidence in the new 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.850
 management after all that he gave up the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.239
 her husband had a responsibility 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.500
 refurbished to do a good job 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.400
 rescuing the worn out image of the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.180
 worn institution of the institution 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.739
 last year 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.230
 I must say that I am still waiting for a 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.530
 signal of change of direction of cbf 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.359
 mainly because of the lack of 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.310
 transparency in the conduct of this 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.840
 national heritage that the selection 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.090
 brazilian soccer 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.459
 so the president once again asks that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.870
 cbf will bring Brazilian society 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.889
 information that it has the right to 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.359
 to receive 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.840
 was all I had to say very 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.840
 thank you
