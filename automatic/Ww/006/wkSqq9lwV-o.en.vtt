 re

 re 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.510
 goo 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.740
 That ideal partner everyone from now 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:44.260
 Though I think a place called trying to find a nice person 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.980
 Of course I think that some of you are already married . 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.240
 partner 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:55.490
 It is the first place of the work, but of the work par that oneself of that work is this shop name 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:02.300
 Even when looking for toner 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:06.320
 A say by all means is it my best partner the most ideal partner because it is when 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 What kind of feeling should we have when we meet? 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.480
 I think that I want to talk a little today 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 I'm getting married now if I talk to you in other seminars 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.870
 Say do is I want to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:27.010
 A woman has appeared 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 2 When pulling an ideal partner just like a normal pulling 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:36.500
 To what kind of wind I usually Nde was told do I Hikiyosere 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 When I first heard that I'm 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.010
 For example, if you want a car abstractly, it's better not just to get a car 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.510
 Toka is a red car 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.020
 Models also the Fu that it'd also good Nde I Audi Dah Dah whether to be a Porsche 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.780
 This kind of concrete 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.469
 It's all about this kind of sporty type with a car like this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.960
 It is written to various people that you should think about it 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.960
 That's why I thought about it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.660
 Attracting the ideal partner and so-called prosperity 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.660
 I seen I'm different from the drawn when Tteyuu want to get to these things 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.290
 In fact, it will spread 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:30.469
 The directionality of energy is different 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:36.379
 That N useless If you do not know that it's useless even in the same fashion in the law of the same attracted 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:37.380
 It doesn't work well, but do you say the tips for attracting the ideal partner 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.570
 Ne 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.570
 I guess what do you say to the point 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.120
 Yup 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.569
 First one eye is one if there maybe are three I think I got another idea 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.390
 It is the wavelength of that long 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:25.180
 It is putting out the harmonic wavelength strongly 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.850
 Who do you want to harmonize with the wavelength of harmony? 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 What a super number 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.810
 That wavelength 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 This is a challenge for yourself 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.010
 Whether you and yourself are good 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.930
 Somehow my philosophy is everyone 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:49.450
 It seems that recovery is difficult. 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.250
 It has become very important that I mean if your own and length can be 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.850
 The second one is 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.560
 What kind of story do you want to live with ? 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:06.739
 Whether or not you can imagine 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.739
 Whether you can imagine what kind of story you want to live with 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.569
 The third one 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.569
 what 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.740
