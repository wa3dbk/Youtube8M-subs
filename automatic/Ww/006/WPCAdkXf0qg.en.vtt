the dumpsters have been saying for

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209 
the dumpsters have been saying for
centuries<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:57.679> starting<00:00:58.679> to<00:00:58.769> reach<00:00:58.949> their

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
centuries are starting to reach their

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.259 
centuries are starting to reach their

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
conclusion and that we are in fact

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.789 
conclusion and that we are in fact
living<00:01:03.269> in<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> history<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> prophetic

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
living in that history in a prophetic

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
living in that history in a prophetic
time<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.280> Bible<00:01:05.610> calls<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.940> time<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
time that the Bible calls the time of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.980 
time that the Bible calls the time of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the end so uh here's the explanation

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.470 
the end so uh here's the explanation
perhaps<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:12.450> should

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
perhaps the first thing that we should

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.080 
perhaps the first thing that we should
do<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> help<00:01:13.140> everyone<00:01:13.970> understand<00:01:14.970> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
concern is that there would be people

concern is that there would be people
who<00:04:18.919> would<00:04:19.919> defame<00:04:20.720> blaspheme<00:04:21.720> or<00:04:22.049> use<00:04:22.950> God's

actual name in a way which would bring

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.010 
actual name in a way which would bring
disrespect<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:30.090> God

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
disrespect to God

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.190 
disrespect to God

so one of the most important things man

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.080 
so one of the most important things man
for<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> Christian<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:34.950> know<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.640> he<00:04:35.790> doesn't

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
for a Christian to know so he doesn't

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.660 
for a Christian to know so he doesn't
make<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> mistake<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.820> God's<00:04:38.900> actual<00:04:39.900> name<00:04:40.670> so

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
would be sown with Satan see and these

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.130 
would be sown with Satan see and these
would<00:06:05.550> grow<00:06:05.730> into<00:06:05.940> weeds<00:06:06.210> that<00:06:06.780> would<00:06:06.960> grow

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
would grow into weeds that would grow

all given a great deal of importance

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.709 
all given a great deal of importance
in<00:06:43.930> this<00:06:44.409> commercial<00:06:44.889> world<00:06:45.039> that<00:06:45.370> we<00:06:45.490> live<00:06:45.669> in

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
in this commercial world that we live in

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.610 
in this commercial world that we live in
so<00:06:46.719> if<00:06:47.520> God's<00:06:48.520> kingdom<00:06:48.819> is<00:06:49.150> on<00:06:49.300> this<00:06:49.479> earth<00:06:49.629> at

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
the present time we didn't have a name

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.019 
the present time we didn't have a name
and<00:06:53.610> what<00:06:54.610> would<00:06:54.729> it<00:06:54.879> be<00:06:54.909> called<00:06:57.029> something

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029 
and what would it be called something

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.279 
and what would it be called something
that<00:06:58.180> we<00:06:58.300> should<00:06:58.539> be<00:06:58.719> very<00:06:58.749> carefully

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
that we should be very carefully

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.719 
that we should be very carefully
watching<00:06:59.620> for<00:06:59.800> then<00:06:59.979> his<00:07:01.529> people<00:07:02.580> who<00:07:03.580> are

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
watching for then his people who are

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:04.529 
watching for then his people who are
using<00:07:03.969> God's<00:07:04.270> name

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
using God's name

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.969 
using God's name
and<00:07:04.719> so<00:07:05.680> if<00:07:05.979> God's<00:07:06.219> name<00:07:06.490> is<00:07:06.669> Jehovah<00:07:06.969> that

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
and so if God's name is Jehovah that

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.989 
and so if God's name is Jehovah that
immediately<00:07:08.979> brings<00:07:09.249> everyone's<00:07:09.759> attention

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999 
immediately brings everyone's attention

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.719 
immediately brings everyone's attention

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
Witnesses so could it actually be true

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.800 
Witnesses so could it actually be true
that<00:07:17.370> Jehovah's<00:07:18.370> Witnesses<00:07:18.789> are<00:07:19.029> blasphemy

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
that Jehovah's Witnesses are blasphemy

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.200 
that Jehovah's Witnesses are blasphemy
or<00:07:19.960> undermining<00:07:20.999> disrespecting<00:07:21.999> God's
