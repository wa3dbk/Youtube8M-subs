 the fifth time with as many people as it was for you 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.510
 The moment the time spent in the vestibule which was processed I always knew I wanted 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.480

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 but peel 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 I did not do it right after finishing the middle school 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.670
 to enroll in college because 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.299
 I continued working to make the journalism faculty already curable. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.070
 worked in the area already did radio 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.740
 already started on television so you always 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.430
 very present for me this certainty that it was a journalism is just one 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.689
 matter of moment 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.500
 to start college so many dramas live 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.170
 to choose the profession 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.500
 had any technique 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.910
 the selection only seeks to contain vaccination 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.280
 I think I'm that anxiety, right? 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.390
 maybe a little homeopathic tranquilizer 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 it's just to contain the anxiety plus 0 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.040
