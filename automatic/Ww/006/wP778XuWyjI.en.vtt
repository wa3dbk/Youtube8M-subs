00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.140
 to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello beautiful and pretty in this video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.650
 I bring a nail design that I love 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.960
 It looks very original and elaborated but it is 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.200
 of the simplest in the world so if you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.080
 Interests still looking 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.900
 the things that we will need are base 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.360
 protective nail polish white or 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 color that you prefer alcohol a 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.400
 small container 10 pieces of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260
 newspaper and if you want a chocolate but 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 this is optional and then I'll tell you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.320
 what 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540
 let's start by applying a layer of 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.590
 protective base so that the enamel us 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.590
 damage our nails 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.440
 and we wait for it to dry very well and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.420
 for that is chocolate, not chocolate 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.160
 it will not make it dry faster but 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.590
 Now that our waiting time is 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.590
 much more pleasant good idea not 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.229
 since we are with our base we will apply 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 a thin layer of white enamel what 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.030
 thinnest you can not worry 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 If the color does not cover your nail very well 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 then we will apply another layer 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.860
 and wait for it to dry 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.580
 and now the second layer remembers that it is 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.190
 better to apply several thin layers or 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.750
 that a very thick one takes less time to dry 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.750
 and it looks much nicer 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.920
 and keep eating chocolate I say 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.920
 keep waiting 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.290
 in the container we will take a splash 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.400
 of alcohol enough so you can 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.400
 immerse yours 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.810
 and now comes the fun we 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:26.860
 we will talk about alcohol 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.950
 do not believe we're going to drink alcohol with 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.040
 our hand and we will submerge our nail 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.550
 in the container for about 5 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.550
 seconds 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.770
 we take our finger out of alcohol and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.650
 we put a piece of newspaper on 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.410
 our wet nail put a little more 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 alcohol and we will press 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.610
 approximately for 15 seconds 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.629
 and carefully we remove the newspaper 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 you see how magical alcohol makes the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.650
 newspaper ink is transferred to your 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.650
 nails a little does not look great 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.370
 and now sixth in all your nails I 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.950
 I discovered that if you press the piece of paper 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.260
 the 15 seconds followed so well 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.390
 machine or strongly so that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.670
 understand the ink is like more 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.540
 marked that when you press several 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.100
 times but that's just my recommendation 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.610
 remember that you can do it like you 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.610
 you prefer 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.379
 ah 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.379
 i 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.849
 i 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.709
 finally we will apply a layer of 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.650
 transparent enamel to seal the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.799
 design and give it a better finished and 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.799
 ready you have your newspaper nails 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.800
 I hope you liked this design is 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.020
 one of my favorites because it looks very 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.330
 original and it is very easy to do 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.730
 remember that you can do it with the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.470
 colors that you choose and if you do not 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.750
