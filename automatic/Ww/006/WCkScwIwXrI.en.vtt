before<00:01:02.429> with<00:01:03.210> these<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.539> devices<00:01:03.929> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
before with these little devices so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310 
before with these little devices so
there's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> reason<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.820> Apple<00:01:06.240> says<00:01:06.509> there's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
there's a reason that Apple says there's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
there's a reason that Apple says there's
an<00:01:07.560> app<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.040> there<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.659> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
an app for that there really is if you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
an app for that there really is if you
think<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.490> need<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
think of something that you need to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
think of something that you need to
solve<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.840> look<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> app<00:01:13.950> store

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
solve go look it up in the app store

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
solve go look it up in the app store
because<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.820> bet<00:01:15.149> you<00:01:15.329> someone<00:01:15.899> did<00:01:16.200> write<00:01:16.710> an
