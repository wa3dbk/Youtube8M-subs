00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
yourself so as far as the device itself

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
yourself so as far as the device itself
is<00:00:58.260> concerned<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> design<00:00:59.460> perspective

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is concerned from a design perspective

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.479 
is concerned from a design perspective
it's<00:01:00.570> not<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> bad<00:01:01.050> looking<00:01:01.440> device<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.100> round

it's not a bad looking device it's round

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
it's not a bad looking device it's round
so<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> looks<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> place<00:01:03.870> with

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
so it looks a little out of place with

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
so it looks a little out of place with
most<00:01:04.439> things<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:04.949> entertainment<00:01:05.489> center

but<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.630> easily

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
but it's very small so you can easily

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
but it's very small so you can easily
tuck<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> somewhere<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> won't<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
