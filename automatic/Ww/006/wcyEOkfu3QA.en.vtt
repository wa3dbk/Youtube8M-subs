 It's all on the dial. It's a fagot. Nearly 200 . 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.640
 It is truly a treasure hunting luxury watches, but the hiding is true.

 To be a workspace for a watchmaker , death is a watermelon. 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.370
 But if I was just looking at the tools , maybe I was in the operating room. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:57.370
 It's easy to touch my fingerprints from the beginning . 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:01.720
 If the fingerprint is on the expression of the moment, it will be gone. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.990

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:34.120
 It was the age when the eldest son jumped into the front line of life. 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.120
 His age is 17 years old. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.780
 I did not learn to repair watches from Archer. 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:49.110

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:52.920
 But when this fairly expensive because the metal band value that consumers sseudaga 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:57.210

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:21.740
 So I grabbed the old clock and tapped it again and again. 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.740
 It features foreign national who wants to try and challenge the enlightened self-taught skills 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.689
 After three challenges 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:33.159
 I'm investigating the gold medal. 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.689

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:41.739
