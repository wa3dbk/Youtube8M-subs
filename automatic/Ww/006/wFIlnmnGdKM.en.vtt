00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello dear friends and now we want 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 again the body below 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.210
 show and face some problems 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.210
 point out 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.439
 We start again from the beginning 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 as already described 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.890
 now front around the areas and the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.400
 profiles here in the field of lamps 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.529
 mounts that are rusted on 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.989
 even this body is already missing 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.629
 the gain special sit here 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.570
 corner 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 You can also see some festivals here 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 from the reinforcement sheet was in here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 The area often sits 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.039
 The footwell area as here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.190
 welded over overlayed with blechen 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.190
 been 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:13.050
 in this case all are already missing 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:19.880
 Risks in the floor panel this whole part 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.880
 here is not original anymore yes 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.770
 Of course you will see next here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.159
 also very nice the lower one 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 players know the most already 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.969
 several layers were welded over 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.969
 and are damaged 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.780
 The original ground has here in the middle 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.420
 seat box area still sink this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 Also you have ever missed in this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.270
 There are cavities in the same area 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.670
 as here you are already quite good 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.680
 can recognize 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.010
 here, too, the first rust through the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 are high profile from the inside ansitz 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.270
 Boxes are also often welded over 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.270
 have been 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.570
 the rear wheel arch the same picture in the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.970
 normal case are already here 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:44.300
 Profiles used here 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.960
 Here you can see some rest by the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.540
 cable channels or through the cables 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.450
 for the taillights and the socket 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.340
 behind what is also very often behind the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.140
 fortification tin hold me with that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.790
 The body screwed on the arms 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.790
 is also often rust 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.620
 Here you can see a compression 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.910
 by a rear-end collision or 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.910
 similar were caused 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.730
 Thanks to area often this is known 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:35.700
 hardly available anymore 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:40.040
 Here is also located in front of where the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.040
 cable channels or in the cable cross-country 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:52.410
 also here several times over sweat and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.040
 gladly made no original cable channels 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.040
 more available 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.900
 Here you can see the hole profile of 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.879
 below with the rust holes under the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.560
 Rear seat guests that's the area 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:17.000
 where the seat cushions fold from above 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:22.109
 screwed on are also here 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.449
 welded through rusting that is the 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.380
 area in which the handbrake with the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.380
 differential sits 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:36.169
 on the second page you can see 

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:40.439
 also various over welding 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:44.759
 fast range with the people 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:47.089
 perforation corrosion ever even care 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.089
 should 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:11.300
 they can also be new ones 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:14.020
 welded-in area in the fender 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.020
 Area 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:26.349
 this is the middle range in which the 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:30.089
 He also sits back from his arms 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:33.669
 here school profiles for various 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:37.269
 rust through in these areas 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:42.899
 Often, they are either already welded 

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:45.239
 are or are just fine 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:48.579
 if here again a little look 

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:53.219
 looks behind the dashboard 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:53.219
 some aspirations and plates 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.429
 glove box box 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.820
 festival from proposals submitted 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.820
 activity 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.509
 Well 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.879
 which was then s first time as far
