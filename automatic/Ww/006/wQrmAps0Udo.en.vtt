I'm going to show you how to locate the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.519 
I'm going to show you how to locate the
spawn<00:00:05.460> chunks<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:05.970> your<00:00:06.000> Minecraft<00:00:06.720> world<00:00:06.990> for

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
spawn chunks in your Minecraft world for

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.839 
spawn chunks in your Minecraft world for
those<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.919> who<00:00:08.040> do<00:00:08.189> not<00:00:08.400> know<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.610> the

those of you who do not know what the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.459 
those of you who do not know what the
spawn<00:00:09.090> chunks<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.630> they<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> group<00:00:10.290> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
spawn chunks are they are a group of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.709 
spawn chunks are they are a group of
twelve<00:00:10.530> by<00:00:11.130> twelve<00:00:11.160> chunks<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.389> always

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
twelve by twelve chunks that are always

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.660 
twelve by twelve chunks that are always
loaded<00:00:13.170> wherever<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.830> go<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.219> your<00:00:14.429> world

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
loaded wherever you go in your world

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.790 
loaded wherever you go in your world
this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> same<00:00:15.809> put<00:00:16.049> both<00:00:16.199> servers<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
this is the same put both servers and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.740 
this is the same put both servers and
single-player<00:00:17.490> worlds<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.270> first<00:00:18.510> let<00:00:18.720> me

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
single-player worlds but first let me

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269 
single-player worlds but first let me
explain<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.410> why<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> might<00:00:20.010> want<00:00:20.220> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
explain to you why you might want to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
explain to you why you might want to
find<00:00:20.730> them<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.630> spawn<00:00:21.900> chunks<00:00:22.109> are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
find them because the spawn chunks are

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.900 
find them because the spawn chunks are
always<00:00:22.529> loaded<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.160> ideal<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.490> things

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
always loaded they are ideal for things

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.759 
always loaded they are ideal for things
you<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.269> running<00:00:24.779> all<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> time<00:00:25.230> for

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you would want running all the time for

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
you would want running all the time for
example<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.340> iron<00:00:26.699> farm<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> redstone

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
example an iron farm or a redstone

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
example an iron farm or a redstone
contraption<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.160> spawn<00:00:29.429> chunks<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
contraption the spawn chunks are also

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
contraption the spawn chunks are also
placed<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> items<00:00:30.990> come<00:00:31.230> through<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
placed the items come through from the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
placed the items come through from the
end<00:00:31.949> portal<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> might<00:00:33.210> want<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> build<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
end portal so you might want to build a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.450 
end portal so you might want to build a
storage<00:00:34.170> system<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> collect<00:00:35.309> those

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
storage system here to collect those

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.370 
storage system here to collect those
items<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.899> following<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
items and if you are following this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
items and if you are following this
video<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:37.920> attempt<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> mark<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.790> your

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
video in an attempt to mark out your

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
video in an attempt to mark out your
spawn<00:00:39.210> chunks<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:40.079> sure<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.410> watch<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
spawn chunks make sure you watch the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
spawn chunks make sure you watch the
whole<00:00:40.829> video<00:00:40.980> first<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.850> plan<00:00:42.149> out

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
whole video first so you can plan out

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.470 
whole video first so you can plan out
everything<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.230> will<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.829> this

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
everything you will need to do this

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.610 
everything you will need to do this
finding<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> spawn<00:00:45.840> chunks<00:00:46.079> isn't<00:00:46.500> too

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
finding the spawn chunks isn't too

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
finding the spawn chunks isn't too
difficult<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.430> several<00:00:47.670> ways<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
difficult and there are several ways to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.029 
difficult and there are several ways to
find<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.500> over<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:49.860> one

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
find them and we will go over them one

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.500 
find them and we will go over them one
by<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.390> an

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
by one first of all you can use an

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
by one first of all you can use an
external<00:00:51.600> program<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.500> admist<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
external program like admist if you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
external program like admist if you
enter<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:54.090> seed<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.780> show<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
enter your seed it will show you the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
enter your seed it will show you the
coordinates<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.890> base<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> home

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
coordinates of your base with the home

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
coordinates of your base with the home
icon<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.870> may<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.050> considered<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.739> little

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
icon but this may be considered a little

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
icon but this may be considered a little
bit<00:00:59.160> cheaty<00:00:59.489> which<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> fine<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.600> there

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
bit cheaty which is fine because there

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
bit cheaty which is fine because there
are<00:01:01.020> two<00:01:01.199> ways<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> find<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> in-game<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.940> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
are two ways to find it in-game you can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
are two ways to find it in-game you can
craft<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.570> compass<00:01:03.989> which<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.439> always<00:01:04.619> point

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
craft a compass which will always point

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.649 
craft a compass which will always point
to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> center<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.729> spawn<00:01:06.150> chunks<00:01:06.360> just

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to the center of your spawn chunks just

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
to the center of your spawn chunks just
follow<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> needle<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> compass<00:01:08.010> until

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
follow the needle of the compass until

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
follow the needle of the compass until
it<00:01:08.850> changes<00:01:09.270> direction<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:09.960> quickly<00:01:10.260> when

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it changes direction very quickly when

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
it changes direction very quickly when
this<00:01:11.070> happens<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.640> either<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.420> very

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this happens you are either at or very

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
this happens you are either at or very
close<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> central<00:01:13.890> point<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.760> move

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
close to the central point so move

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
close to the central point so move
around<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> moment<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.350> become

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
around for a moment and it will become

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
around for a moment and it will become
obvious<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> center<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
obvious where the center is when you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
obvious where the center is when you
have<00:01:18.659> figured<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:19.110> making<00:01:19.590> marker<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
have figured out making marker to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
have figured out making marker to
remember<00:01:20.549> where<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> location<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
remember where this location is this is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
remember where this location is this is
a<00:01:22.409> fantastic<00:01:22.920> tool<00:01:23.340> however<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a fantastic tool however if you are a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
a fantastic tool however if you are a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
long way away it may be quicker to kill

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
long way away it may be quicker to kill
yourself<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.150> slept<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> bed<00:01:27.780> then

yourself if you have slept in a bed then

yourself if you have slept in a bed then
you<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.560> need<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> remove<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> bed<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you will need to remove the bed for the

you will need to remove the bed for the
game<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.090> respawn<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> spawn<00:01:31.470> chunks

game to respawn you in the spawn chunks

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
game to respawn you in the spawn chunks
when<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> respawn<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.390> may<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.720> be

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
when you do respawn it may not be

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
when you do respawn it may not be
exactly<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> middle<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
exactly in the middle so it would be a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
exactly in the middle so it would be a
good<00:01:35.790> idea<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> compass<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> mark<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
good idea to get a compass and mark the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.789 
good idea to get a compass and mark the
center<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.670> before<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.439> you're<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.560> sure

thousand blocks away from it it might
not<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.869> worth<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.110> journey<00:01:52.380> using<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.009> compass

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
not be worth the journey using a compass

not be worth the journey using a compass
and<00:01:53.610> quicker<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.119> kill<00:01:54.329> yourself<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and quicker to kill yourself but the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.370 
and quicker to kill yourself but the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you will need to go through a nether

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.410 
you will need to go through a nether
portal<00:02:37.890> when<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.520> are<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> nether<00:02:39.060> only

you<00:03:02.580> should<00:03:02.820> see<00:03:03.060> where<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.450> trail<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.959> items

you should see where your trail of items

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.230 
you should see where your trail of items
cuts<00:03:04.590> off<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.220> because<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> items<00:03:06.090> in

cuts off this is because the items in

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.970 
cuts off this is because the items in

a chunk border if it is then you have

spawn<00:03:14.520> chunks<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.330> should<00:03:15.540> mark<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.959> with

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
spawn chunks you should mark this with

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.199 
spawn chunks you should mark this with
some<00:03:16.410> blocks<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.920> don't<00:03:17.220> forget<00:03:17.370> where<00:03:18.090> it

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
some blocks so you don't forget where it

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.440 
some blocks so you don't forget where it
is<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:18.930> now<00:03:19.230> walk<00:03:19.500> exactly<00:03:20.130> 192<00:03:21.120> blocks

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
is you can now walk exactly 192 blocks

back across your spawn chunks to the
opposite<00:03:23.970> side<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.540> would<00:03:24.630> recommend<00:03:25.080> redoing

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
opposite side I would recommend redoing

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.290 
opposite side I would recommend redoing
the<00:03:25.590> test<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.130> area<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.940> make<00:03:27.090> sure

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the test in this area just to make sure

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.479 
the test in this area just to make sure
that<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.080> correct<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:28.980> make<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> mark

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
that it is correct and then make a mark

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.490 
that it is correct and then make a mark
on<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.910> side<00:03:30.150> as<00:03:30.330> well<00:03:30.540> once<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.290> done

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
on this side as well once you have done

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
on this side as well once you have done
this<00:03:31.650> return<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.340> middle<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.760> repeat<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this return to the middle and repeat the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.840 
this return to the middle and repeat the
test<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.080> opposite<00:03:34.560> axis<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.489> shouldn't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
test on the opposite axis it shouldn't

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.670 
test on the opposite axis it shouldn't
take<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.209> too<00:03:36.450> long<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.870> once<00:03:37.140> finished<00:03:37.440> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
take you too long and once finished you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.410 
take you too long and once finished you
have<00:03:37.860> successfully<00:03:38.340> marked<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> borders

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
have successfully marked out the borders

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.350 
have successfully marked out the borders
of<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.959> 12<00:03:40.290> by<00:03:40.470> 12<00:03:40.769> chunk<00:03:41.130> area<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:42.239> is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
of the 12 by 12 chunk area so this is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.880 
of the 12 by 12 chunk area so this is
optional<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.019> what<00:03:43.140> I'd<00:03:43.260> recommend<00:03:43.440> doing

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
optional but what I'd recommend doing

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.710 
optional but what I'd recommend doing
next<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.459> expanding<00:03:45.030> those<00:03:45.180> borders<00:03:45.570> until

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
next is expanding those borders until

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.660 
next is expanding those borders until
you<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> big<00:03:46.440> square<00:03:46.769> showing<00:03:47.459> where<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
you have a big square showing where the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.390 
you have a big square showing where the
edges<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.209> spawn<00:03:48.630> chunks<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.400> so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
edges of your spawn chunks are and so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.770 
edges of your spawn chunks are and so
there<00:03:50.640> are<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> couple<00:03:50.850> more<00:03:51.269> things<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.690> would

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
there are a couple more things I would

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.870 
there are a couple more things I would
like<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.170> mention<00:03:52.560> about<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.010> first<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.790> all

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
like to mention about this first of all

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.790 
like to mention about this first of all
you<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.300> move<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.720> spawn<00:03:54.959> chunks<00:03:55.200> using<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
you can move the spawn chunks using the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.100 
you can move the spawn chunks using the
set<00:03:56.130> world<00:03:56.310> spawn<00:03:56.700> command<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.720> do<00:03:57.930> this

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
set world spawn command if you do this

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.600 
set world spawn command if you do this
then<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.410> will<00:03:58.560> still<00:03:58.800> need<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.160> redo<00:03:59.489> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
then you will still need to redo the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.400 
then you will still need to redo the
item<00:03:59.940> D<00:04:00.090> spawning<00:04:00.390> test<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.900> find<00:04:01.080> out<00:04:01.260> the

borders however the center will be
exactly<00:04:03.810> where<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.350> type<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.920> command<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the very center of the spawn chunks is
