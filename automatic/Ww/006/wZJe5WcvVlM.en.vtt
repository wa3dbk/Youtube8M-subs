adjusting gun balance and the way the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.529 
adjusting gun balance and the way the
game<00:00:31.350> plays<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> CTE<00:00:32.609> and<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.359> the<00:00:33.420> most

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
game plays out in CTE and for the most

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.540 
game plays out in CTE and for the most
part<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> goes<00:00:34.050> something<00:00:34.379> like<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.559> assault

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
part it goes something like this assault

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
part it goes something like this assault
rifles<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> become<00:00:36.480> less<00:00:36.690> accurate

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
rifles are going to become less accurate

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
rifles are going to become less accurate
with<00:00:37.289> a<00:00:37.320> bit<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:37.710> sprite<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.129> range<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
with a bit more sprite at range and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.770 
with a bit more sprite at range and
they're<00:00:38.729> also<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.089> receive<00:00:39.179> a<00:00:39.420> little

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
they're also going to receive a little

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
they're also going to receive a little
more<00:00:39.929> recoil<00:00:40.289> so<00:00:40.589> that<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.859> have<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
more recoil so that way you have to have

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
more recoil so that way you have to have
a<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.429> more<00:00:41.460> skill<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.999> control<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.539> PDW<00:00:43.229> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a bit more skill to control them PDW is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
a bit more skill to control them PDW is
on<00:00:43.589> the<00:00:43.679> other<00:00:43.800> hand<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:44.309> pretty<00:00:44.609> much<00:00:44.699> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
on the other hand are pretty much the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
on the other hand are pretty much the
opposite<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.449> this<00:00:45.629> having<00:00:46.019> a<00:00:46.139> little<00:00:46.469> less

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
opposite of this having a little less

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.139 
opposite of this having a little less
spread<00:00:46.889> so<00:00:47.069> that<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.339> they're<00:00:47.519> more<00:00:47.670> usable

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
spread so that way they're more usable

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
spread so that way they're more usable
and<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.749> way<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> engineer<00:00:49.409> is<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.710> likely

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and that way the engineer is more likely

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.349 
and that way the engineer is more likely
to<00:00:50.100> choose<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.609> over<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
to choose that over something like a

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.479 
to choose that over something like a
carbine<00:00:51.839> and<00:00:52.049> then<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> dmrs<00:00:52.979> are<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.280> going

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
carbine and then the dmrs are also going

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
carbine and then the dmrs are also going
to<00:00:53.549> be<00:00:53.670> receiving<00:00:54.179> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.690> less<00:00:54.839> accuracy

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to be receiving a little less accuracy

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
to be receiving a little less accuracy
at<00:00:55.559> range<00:00:55.799> that<00:00:56.339> way<00:00:56.549> if<00:00:56.729> you're<00:00:56.850> using<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.299> as

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
at range that way if you're using it as

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090 
at range that way if you're using it as
an<00:00:57.539> assault<00:00:57.839> player<00:00:58.049> an<00:00:58.289> engineer<00:00:58.709> you're<00:00:58.979> not

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
an assault player an engineer you're not

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500 
an assault player an engineer you're not
going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> able<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.609> compete<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.329> with

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to be able to compete as well with

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.539 
going to be able to compete as well with
snipers<00:01:00.929> at<00:01:01.170> longer<00:01:01.559> ranges<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.280> that's

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
snipers at longer ranges so that's

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:03.799 
snipers at longer ranges so that's
pretty<00:01:02.729> much<00:01:02.879> basically<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.539> they're<00:01:03.690> going

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pretty much basically what they're going

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
pretty much basically what they're going
to<00:01:03.929> be<00:01:04.049> doing<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.500> gun<00:01:04.530> balance<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to be doing for gun balance and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.560 
to be doing for gun balance and
obviously<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.330> some

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
obviously there's going to be some

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
obviously there's going to be some
custom<00:01:06.990> things<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.440> they're<00:01:07.590> doing<00:01:07.619> for

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
custom things that they're doing for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
custom things that they're doing for
individual<00:01:08.640> guns<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.150> terms<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> balance<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
individual guns in terms of balance and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
individual guns in terms of balance and
these<00:01:10.800> changes<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.310> expected<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.940> launch

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
these changes are expected to launch

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.850 
these changes are expected to launch
sometime<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.720> spring<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.800> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
sometime in the spring and it's going to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
sometime in the spring and it's going to
be<00:01:13.950> part<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.430> patch<00:01:14.670> similar<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
be part of a big patch similar to the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.870 
be part of a big patch similar to the
fall<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.080> winter<00:01:16.260> patch<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.130> ever<00:01:17.460> since<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
fall and winter patch so ever since the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.430 
fall and winter patch so ever since the
fall<00:01:18.090> patch<00:01:18.300> dice<00:01:18.630> has<00:01:18.780> been<00:01:18.930> trying<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.260> kind

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
fall patch dice has been trying to kind

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.900 
fall patch dice has been trying to kind
of<00:01:19.530> real<00:01:19.710> back<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.160> power<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> assault

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
of real back the power of the assault

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.340 
of real back the power of the assault
class<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.660> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:21.960> played

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
class because it is the most played

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
class because it is the most played
class<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.980> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> hop<00:01:23.370> into<00:01:23.550> around<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
class like if you hop into around a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
class like if you hop into around a
battlefield<00:01:24.300> chances<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> most<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
battlefield chances are that most of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
battlefield chances are that most of
them<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.190> all<00:01:26.370> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.700> assault<00:01:27.120> players

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
them are all going to be assault players

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
them are all going to be assault players
and<00:01:27.600> there's<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> reason<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.410> that<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.830> if

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and there's a reason for that because if

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
and there's a reason for that because if
you<00:01:29.220> throw<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.640> class<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.300> an<00:01:30.510> assault

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
rifle that performs well it pretty much

rifle that performs well it pretty much
any<00:01:32.940> range<00:01:33.300> other<00:01:33.570> than<00:01:33.780> extremely<00:01:34.500> long

any range other than extremely long
ranges<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.060> give<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.420> medic<00:01:36.690> bag<00:01:36.840> in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
something like that that's going to be

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
something like that that's going to be
the<00:01:40.890> most<00:01:41.010> popular<00:01:41.250> class<00:01:41.700> by<00:01:41.940> far<00:01:42.240> you've<00:01:42.600> got

the most versatility you can heal

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.800 
the most versatility you can heal
yourself<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.480> to<00:01:45.630> worry

about teammates giving you a med bags
really<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.450> only<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.900> I<00:01:49.020> agree<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.380> in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
really the only thing I agree with in

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.500 
really the only thing I agree with in
this<00:01:49.800> patch<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.760> engine<00:01:51.120> you<00:01:51.240> should

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
this patch is that the engine you should

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.030 
this patch is that the engine you should
get<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.870> more<00:01:52.020> power<00:01:52.260> with<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> submachine

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
get a bit more power with the submachine

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
get a bit more power with the submachine
guns<00:01:53.400> because<00:01:53.580> especially<00:01:53.970> coming<00:01:54.420> from

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
guns because especially coming from

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
guns because especially coming from
hardline<00:01:55.080> where<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> things<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
hardline where you have things like the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
hardline where you have things like the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
k10 and the p90 those things are

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
k10 and the p90 those things are
absolute<00:01:58.740> beasts<00:01:59.370> at<00:01:59.550> close<00:01:59.909> range<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> they

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
absolute beasts at close range and they

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
absolute beasts at close range and they
put<00:02:00.840> down<00:02:01.020> people<00:02:01.350> incredibly<00:02:02.070> quickly<00:02:02.310> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
put down people incredibly quickly so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
put down people incredibly quickly so
coming<00:02:02.940> back<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> having<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> PDW

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
coming back to this and having a PDW

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.469 
coming back to this and having a PDW
that<00:02:05.100> takes<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> same<00:02:05.580> amount<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.970> bullets<00:02:06.270> at

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that takes the same amount of bullets at

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
that takes the same amount of bullets at
a<00:02:06.540> similar<00:02:07.290> fire<00:02:07.650> rate<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> kill<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.519> an

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
a similar fire rate to kill as an

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
a similar fire rate to kill as an
assault<00:02:08.909> rifle<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.659> really<00:02:09.840> tough<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.110> see

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
assault rifle it's really tough to see

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.899 
assault rifle it's really tough to see
why<00:02:10.619> you'd<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> use<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.459> over

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
why you'd want to use this over

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.240 
why you'd want to use this over
something<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.450> ACR<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> carbine<00:02:13.650> now

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
something like the ACR as a carbine now

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.619 
something like the ACR as a carbine now
keep<00:02:14.579> in<00:02:14.700> mind<00:02:14.909> there's<00:02:15.120> still<00:02:15.329> several

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
keep in mind there's still several

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.179 
keep in mind there's still several
months<00:02:16.019> before<00:02:16.319> they<00:02:16.409> actually<00:02:16.560> release<00:02:17.010> this

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
months before they actually release this

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.830 
months before they actually release this
patch<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.700> chances<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.299> it's<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.719> be<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
patch so chances are it's going to be a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.030 
patch so chances are it's going to be a
lot<00:02:19.260> different<00:02:19.290> than<00:02:19.829> what

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
lot different than what

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
lot different than what
Ct<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:20.849> because<00:02:21.209> obviously<00:02:21.450> that's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
Ct is right now because obviously that's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.959 
Ct is right now because obviously that's
the<00:02:22.049> whole<00:02:22.200> point<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.500> CTE<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.549> make<00:02:23.670> little

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
the whole point of CTE is to make little

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.369 
the whole point of CTE is to make little
adjustments<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:24.689> what<00:02:24.840> works<00:02:25.049> what<00:02:25.319> doesn't

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
adjustments see what works what doesn't

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.920 
adjustments see what works what doesn't
and<00:02:25.859> what<00:02:26.219> to<00:02:26.340> put<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.760> final<00:02:27.090> patch<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.689> in

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and what to put in a final patch so in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.929 
and what to put in a final patch so in
terms<00:02:28.469> of<00:02:28.650> class<00:02:28.859> balance<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.760> don't

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
terms of class balance I really don't

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.429 
terms of class balance I really don't
think<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.420> should<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.599> any<00:02:30.659> more<00:02:31.019> changes

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
think there should be any more changes

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.170 
think there should be any more changes
other<00:02:31.709> than<00:02:31.799> slightly<00:02:32.280> increasing<00:02:32.969> the<00:02:33.060> power

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
other than slightly increasing the power

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.000 
other than slightly increasing the power
the<00:02:33.420> PDW<00:02:33.989> use<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.349> that's<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the PDW use because that's really the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.679 
the PDW use because that's really the
only<00:02:35.040> thing<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.579> don't<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:35.939> people<00:02:35.969> using<00:02:36.269> on

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
only thing you don't see people using on

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.360 
only thing you don't see people using on
the<00:02:36.780> battlefield<00:02:37.200> all<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.650> often<00:02:37.859> unless

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the battlefield all that often unless

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.610 
the battlefield all that often unless
it's<00:02:38.579> really<00:02:38.909> close<00:02:39.150> range<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.810> there's<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.439> lot

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
it's really close range or there's a lot

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.319 
it's really close range or there's a lot
of<00:02:40.650> vehicles<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.640> decided<00:02:42.000> like

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
of vehicles and they just decided like

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.670 
of vehicles and they just decided like
screw<00:02:42.689> around<00:02:42.750> with<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.319> really

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
screw around with it because really

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.679 
screw around with it because really
there's<00:02:44.220> no<00:02:44.400> reason<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:44.939> these<00:02:45.180> over<00:02:45.659> a

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
there's no reason use these over a

that<00:02:52.530> way<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:53.069> not<00:02:53.220> quite<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> top<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.909> your

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
that way it's not quite a top to your

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
that way it's not quite a top to your
weapon<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.720> still<00:02:54.959> usable<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.829> way

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
weapon it's still usable but that way

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.559 
weapon it's still usable but that way
people<00:02:56.189> who<00:02:56.430> are<00:02:56.549> using<00:02:56.730> lesser<00:02:57.209> weapons

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
people who are using lesser weapons

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.300 
people who are using lesser weapons
still<00:02:58.079> have<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> chance<00:02:58.530> at<00:02:58.709> taking<00:02:58.859> you<00:02:59.069> out

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
still have a chance at taking you out

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.559 
still have a chance at taking you out
and<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.730> really<00:03:00.030> don't<00:03:00.209> think<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
and I really don't think this is

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.479 
and I really don't think this is
necessary<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:01.709> I'm<00:03:01.980> pretty<00:03:02.099> much<00:03:02.220> any

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
necessary because I'm pretty much any

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.220 
necessary because I'm pretty much any
video<00:03:02.849> game<00:03:03.120> where<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.389> have<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.569> large<00:03:03.959> amount

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
video game where you have a large amount

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.379 
video game where you have a large amount
of<00:03:04.319> weapons<00:03:04.439> like<00:03:04.889> battlefield<00:03:05.639> 4<00:03:05.790> has<00:03:06.000> over<00:03:06.359> a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
of weapons like battlefield 4 has over a

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.149 
of weapons like battlefield 4 has over a
hundred<00:03:06.510> different<00:03:07.049> weapons<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.859> they're

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
hundred different weapons and they're

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.039 
hundred different weapons and they're
adding<00:03:08.489> even<00:03:08.609> more<00:03:08.760> with<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.359> weapon<00:03:09.840> crate

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
adding even more with the weapon crate

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.170 
adding even more with the weapon crate
DLC<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:11.069> really<00:03:11.609> think<00:03:11.760> if<00:03:11.970> they're<00:03:12.090> gonna

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
DLC so I really think if they're gonna

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.879 
DLC so I really think if they're gonna
make<00:03:12.419> these<00:03:12.569> adjustments<00:03:12.750> its<00:03:13.319> overall<00:03:13.620> just

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
make these adjustments its overall just

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.500 
make these adjustments its overall just
gonna<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.129> a<00:03:14.189> waste<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.489> time<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.269> you're

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
gonna be a waste of time because you're

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.670 
gonna be a waste of time because you're
always<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:15.959> weapons<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.560> are

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
always going to have weapons that are

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
always going to have weapons that are

a little bit unlock things and really
it's<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.680> nice<00:03:37.859> balance<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.459> having<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.009 
weapons and then people kind of
exploring<00:03:44.879> other<00:03:45.120> weapons<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.750> they<00:03:45.900> have

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
that aren't the best but they're still

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379

in<00:03:49.530> battlefield<00:03:50.010> 4<00:03:50.069> ever<00:03:50.849> since<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.329> started

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
in battlefield 4 ever since we started

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.969 
in battlefield 4 ever since we started
this<00:03:51.780> channel<00:03:51.840> we've<00:03:52.260> been<00:03:52.409> doing<00:03:52.650> loadouts

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
this channel we've been doing loadouts

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.409 
this channel we've been doing loadouts
for<00:03:53.190> battlefield<00:03:53.609> 4<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.180> still

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
for battlefield 4 and there's still

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.939 
for battlefield 4 and there's still
countless<00:03:54.870> loadouts<00:03:55.379> that<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.650> could<00:03:55.769> pick

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
countless loadouts that we could pick

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.319 
countless loadouts that we could pick
from<00:03:56.159> because<00:03:56.459> there's<00:03:56.669> just<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:57.090> many

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
from because there's just that many

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.759 
from because there's just that many
different<00:03:57.690> weapon<00:03:57.989> combinations<00:03:58.260> and

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
different weapon combinations and

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.170 
different weapon combinations and
although<00:03:59.280> they're<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.729> best<00:03:59.849> and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
although they're not the best and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.670 
although they're not the best and
they're<00:04:00.269> not<00:04:00.449> the<00:04:00.569> most<00:04:00.599> balanced<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.530> can

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
they're not the most balanced you can

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.869 
they're not the most balanced you can
still<00:04:01.889> play<00:04:02.069> with<00:04:02.220> them<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.609> pretty

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
still play with them and have a pretty

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.580 
still play with them and have a pretty
decent<00:04:03.329> time<00:04:03.389> so<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> think<00:04:04.019> if<00:04:04.290> they<00:04:04.379> were<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
decent time so I think if they were to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.020 
decent time so I think if they were to
just<00:04:04.739> leave<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.069> gun<00:04:05.250> violence<00:04:05.400> alone<00:04:05.819> for

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
just leave the gun violence alone for

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.729 
just leave the gun violence alone for
the<00:04:06.090> most<00:04:06.269> part<00:04:06.449> maybe<00:04:07.019> increase<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.590> power

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
the most part maybe increase the power

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.500 
the most part maybe increase the power
of<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:07.919> SMGs<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:08.729> would<00:04:08.849> have<00:04:08.939> a<00:04:08.970> really<00:04:09.269> nice

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
of the SMGs we would have a really nice

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780 
of the SMGs we would have a really nice
game<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.139> overall<00:04:10.919> if<00:04:11.220> it's<00:04:11.370> not<00:04:11.519> broken

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
game and overall if it's not broken

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.149 
game and overall if it's not broken
don't<00:04:12.120> fix<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.689> now<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.229> last<00:04:13.590> thing<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.949> wanted

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
don't fix it now the last thing I wanted

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.649 
don't fix it now the last thing I wanted
to<00:04:14.250> touch<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.549> in<00:04:14.699> this<00:04:14.790> video<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.359> what

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
to touch on in this video is what

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.789 
to touch on in this video is what
they're<00:04:15.810> going<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.079> doing<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
they're going to be doing with the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.620 
they're going to be doing with the
suppression<00:04:17.220> system<00:04:17.789> now<00:04:17.940> personally<00:04:18.449> I'm

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
suppression system now personally I'm

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.089 
suppression system now personally I'm
not<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.930> big<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.259> fan<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.530> suppression

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
not that big of a fan of suppression

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.800 
not that big of a fan of suppression
just<00:04:20.519> because<00:04:20.759> it<00:04:20.880> adds<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.180> lot<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.359> randomness

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
just because it adds a lot of randomness

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.749 
just because it adds a lot of randomness
and<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.500> really<00:04:22.680> rewards<00:04:23.190> players<00:04:23.370> for

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
and it really rewards players for

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.610 
and it really rewards players for
missing<00:04:24.060> their<00:04:24.210> shots<00:04:24.449> when<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.229> kind<00:04:25.500> of

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
missing their shots when that's kind of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.560 
missing their shots when that's kind of
just<00:04:25.770> defeating<00:04:26.159> the<00:04:26.250> purpose<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:26.789> anyways

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
just defeating the purpose but anyways

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.420 
just defeating the purpose but anyways
coming<00:04:27.960> into<00:04:28.110> battlefield<00:04:28.590> 4<00:04:28.860> they're<00:04:29.159> going

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
coming into battlefield 4 they're going

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.339 
coming into battlefield 4 they're going
to<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.610> trying<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.000> add<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.690> dynamic

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
to be trying to add in a dynamic

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.980 
to be trying to add in a dynamic
suppression<00:04:31.919> system<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.580> basically<00:04:33.570> if<00:04:33.750> you

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
suppression system so basically if you

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.390 
suppression system so basically if you
machine<00:04:34.380> gun<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.770> you're<00:04:34.890> pretty<00:04:35.070> far<00:04:35.280> away

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
machine gun and you're pretty far away

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.590 
machine gun and you're pretty far away
and<00:04:35.790> you're<00:04:35.940> trying<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.180> shoot<00:04:36.390> someone

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
and you're trying to shoot someone

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.270 
and you're trying to shoot someone
that's<00:04:37.200> really<00:04:37.440> where<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.770> suppression<00:04:38.070> is

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
that's really where the suppression is

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.010 
that's really where the suppression is
going<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.580> its<00:04:38.730> best<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.270> closer<00:04:39.540> ranges

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
going to do its best at closer ranges

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.230 
going to do its best at closer ranges
with<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.590> don't<00:04:41.010> know<00:04:41.070> p<00:04:41.280> dw's<00:04:41.790> or<00:04:42.000> things<00:04:42.150> like

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
with I don't know p dw's or things like

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.730 
with I don't know p dw's or things like
that<00:04:42.360> that's<00:04:42.750> not<00:04:42.870> going<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.200> nearly<00:04:43.500> to

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
that that's not going to have nearly to

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.290 
that that's not going to have nearly to
the<00:04:43.770> effect<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.790> going<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.150> having

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
the effect that it's going to be having

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.660 
the effect that it's going to be having
at<00:04:45.630> longer<00:04:46.050> ranges<00:04:46.440> with<00:04:46.680> more<00:04:46.950> heavy<00:04:47.160> rifles

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
at longer ranges with more heavy rifles

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.670 
at longer ranges with more heavy rifles
so<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.210> really<00:04:48.720> like<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:48.990> idea<00:04:49.170> because<00:04:49.650> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
so I really like this idea because it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.900 
so I really like this idea because it
sounds<00:04:50.190> like<00:04:50.310> there's<00:04:50.550> not<00:04:50.700> going<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.850> be

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
sounds like there's not going to be

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.610 
sounds like there's not going to be
nearly<00:04:51.300> as<00:04:51.510> much<00:04:51.630> suppression<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.440> they

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
nearly as much suppression as they

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.650 
nearly as much suppression as they
normally<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:53.040> in<00:04:53.160> battlefield<00:04:53.580> 4<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:54.030> when<00:04:54.570> it

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
normally is in battlefield 4 and when it

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.510 
normally is in battlefield 4 and when it
comes<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:55.050> ranged<00:04:55.500> engagements<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.280> really

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
comes to ranged engagements you really

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.980 
comes to ranged engagements you really
have<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.670> lot<00:04:56.820> more<00:04:56.970> time<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.420> think<00:04:57.570> about<00:04:57.690> what

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
have a lot more time to think about what

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.080 
have a lot more time to think about what
to<00:04:58.020> do<00:04:58.290> rather<00:04:58.590> than<00:04:58.770> at<00:04:59.250> close<00:04:59.550> range<00:04:59.850> when

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
to do rather than at close range when

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.430 
to do rather than at close range when
you're<00:05:00.120> suppressed<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.870> can't<00:05:01.110> hit<00:05:01.290> your

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
you're suppressed you can't hit your

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.350 
you're suppressed you can't hit your
shots<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.280> lets<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.670> think<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.030> lot<00:05:03.210> more

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
shots and it lets you think a lot more

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.700 
shots and it lets you think a lot more
about<00:05:03.600> what<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.110> when<00:05:04.410> you're<00:05:04.590> being

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
about what to do when you're being

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.260 
about what to do when you're being
suppressed<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.760> way<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:06.090> actually

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
suppressed and that way you can actually

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.910 
suppressed and that way you can actually
have<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.600> chance<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:07.050> surviving<00:05:07.500> rather<00:05:07.740> than

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
have a chance of surviving rather than

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.350 
have a chance of surviving rather than
just<00:05:08.250> blaming<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.730> entire<00:05:09.000> thing<00:05:09.030> on

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
just blaming the entire thing on

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.120 
just blaming the entire thing on
suppression<00:05:09.780> which<00:05:10.140> personally<00:05:10.860> I've<00:05:11.100> never

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
suppression which personally I've never

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.920 
suppression which personally I've never
had<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> moment<00:05:11.880> in<00:05:11.970> battlefield<00:05:12.390> 4<00:05:12.480> where<00:05:12.900> I

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
had a moment in battlefield 4 where I

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.450 
had a moment in battlefield 4 where I
just<00:05:13.290> kind<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.500> get<00:05:13.680> killed<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.100> I'm<00:05:14.190> like<00:05:14.310> ah

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
just kind of get killed and I'm like ah

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460 
just kind of get killed and I'm like ah
the<00:05:14.970> suppression<00:05:15.360> killed<00:05:15.720> me<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:16.050> never

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
the suppression killed me that never

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.260 
the suppression killed me that never
really<00:05:16.710> happened<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.190> me<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.760> think<00:05:18.060> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
really happened to me so I think the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.790 
really happened to me so I think the
suppression<00:05:18.600> system<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.140> pretty<00:05:19.260> okay<00:05:19.620> where

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
suppression system is pretty okay where

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.410 
suppression system is pretty okay where
it<00:05:19.890> is<00:05:20.010> right<00:05:20.160> now<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.400> don't<00:05:20.760> really<00:05:21.000> mind<00:05:21.120> it

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
it is right now I don't really mind it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.420 
it is right now I don't really mind it
and<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:22.140> think<00:05:22.350> if<00:05:22.440> they<00:05:22.560> make<00:05:22.710> some<00:05:22.890> changes<00:05:23.250> it

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
and I think if they make some changes it

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.010 
and I think if they make some changes it
could<00:05:23.550> definitely<00:05:23.820> get<00:05:24.030> better<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.840> don't

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
could definitely get better but I don't

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.930 
could definitely get better but I don't
really<00:05:25.140> care<00:05:25.380> too<00:05:25.590> much<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.700> pretty<00:05:26.850> much

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
really care too much so it's pretty much

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.730 
really care too much so it's pretty much
up<00:05:27.150> for<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.360> video<00:05:27.540> guys<00:05:27.720> as<00:05:28.200> always<00:05:28.350> if<00:05:28.710> you
