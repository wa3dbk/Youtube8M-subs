00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.880
 let's see if the cake is already there 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.580
 we do that with a skewer 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.740
 we pin it in the middle of the cake 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.080
 and me to dry and beauty so then 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.090
 the cake is cooked is your skewer still 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.039
 a little wet then the cake may be 5 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.170
 minutes the opening 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.580
 we will start with the topping for that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 I leave the cake for half an hour 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.880
 cooling down 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 we are the first to go the beautiful shoemixx and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 make sure your monchou is really on 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.000
 room temperature to lumps 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.710
 prevent monchou is beautiful 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.200
 airy blog we asked the topping 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.330
 mixer and the rest of the whipped cream 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.860
 now we mix it all at the highest 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 to a light topping 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.650
 now that the cakes have cooled down we can 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.690
 apply a topping to it 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.550
 I will first remove the baking pan from the cake 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.280
 use a girl for that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.420
 I first get it along the baking pan so that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.530
 the cake comes loose from the baking tin with a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 serrated knife 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.910
 then cut the cake in half 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 top that you get whole 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.950
 Carefully take it off and you now have one 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.600
 bottom and top 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.440
 now we are going to smear the bottom with the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.060
 topping 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 you use one third of the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.060
 topping and put it on top 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.010
 the cake again very carefully on the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.480
 bottom layer 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.070
 and then we go the rest of the cake 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.260
 smear with the topping 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.350
 then I continue with the lesson and then 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.300

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.100

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.530

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.260
