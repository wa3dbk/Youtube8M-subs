00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.570 
little bit more power out of miles that
I<00:00:07.890> 650<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> fabricated<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.860> cylinder<00:00:11.400> head

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
I 650 so I fabricated a cylinder head

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.120 
I 650 so I fabricated a cylinder head
with<00:00:11.969> twin<00:00:12.420> cam<00:00:12.780> arrangement<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
with twin cam arrangement on it

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760 
with twin cam arrangement on it
I<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.730> also<00:00:14.910> fuel-injected<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.990> let's<00:00:16.619> have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I have also fuel-injected it let's have

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
I have also fuel-injected it let's have
a<00:00:16.830> look<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:18.060> how<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.449> goods<00:00:18.869> are

goods<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:58.109> mega<00:00:59.070> squirt<00:00:59.399> as<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.660> super

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
goods from mega squirt as you know super

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
goods from mega squirt as you know super
models<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.680> real<00:01:01.980> razor<00:01:02.370> tools<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.719> do

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
models or real razor tools so they do

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.109 
models or real razor tools so they do
not<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> kick<00:01:04.769> stop<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.970> an

not have a kick stop they do not have an

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.420 
not have a kick stop they do not have an
electric<00:01:06.570> start<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.770> might<00:01:08.010> wonder<00:01:08.250> how

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
electric start so you might wonder how

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.510 
electric start so you might wonder how
am<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.270> fire<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.040> well<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.880> this

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
am I gonna fire this up well with this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.210 
am I gonna fire this up well with this
it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.930> an<00:01:15.930> engine<00:01:17.960> not<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> super<00:01:19.439> model<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it is an engine not a super model but it

00:01:20.220 --> 00:02:32.160 
it is an engine not a super model but it
is<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> thumper<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.259> 402<00:01:22.259> cubic<00:01:22.710> centimeters

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.740 

so<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.500> was<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:34.130> second<00:02:34.640> time<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.850> fired<00:02:35.390> this

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so that was the second time I fired this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.150 
so that was the second time I fired this
beast<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.360> saw<00:02:38.600> mega<00:02:39.350> squirt

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
beast up and as you saw mega squirt

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.870 
beast up and as you saw mega squirt
software<00:02:40.730> wasn't<00:02:41.560> working<00:02:42.560> properly<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
software wasn't working properly and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.760 
software wasn't working properly and
that<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.390> due<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.810> fact<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.380> have<00:02:45.530> not

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
that was due to the fact that I have not

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.280 
that was due to the fact that I have not
installed<00:02:46.400> my<00:02:46.820> generator<00:02:47.300> yet<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
installed my generator yet so the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.460 
installed my generator yet so the
battery<00:02:48.650> was<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.520> down<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.290> simply<00:02:51.290> lost

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
battery was going down and simply lost

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.350 
battery was going down and simply lost
contact

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
contact

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
contact
well<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:55.360> optimizations<00:02:56.360> will<00:02:56.750> continue

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
well the optimizations will continue

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.430 
well the optimizations will continue
stay<00:02:58.130> tuned
