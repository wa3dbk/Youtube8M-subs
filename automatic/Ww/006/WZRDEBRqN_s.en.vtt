00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.490
 in the first half and nothing we raise the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.640
 two semesters to finish the race 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.160
 also maquillo the part d 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.680
 I like everything that is about the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.059
 woman needs happy interns like 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.620
 which is a great satisfaction to 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.290
 me when people make you this 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.199
 stage right that I remember a lot 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 for example this is one when my dad 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:01:00.340
 I was looking for school in a school 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.500
 Now they tell me and we are going to try 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.900
 then I see a friend to get out of that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.910
 hall so long and grab my hand and 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 angry vary with time mind of 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.430
 not if the women said they did not 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.770
 I was going to take what's left 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 then then my dad grabbed me 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.550
 shoulders and he told me measure by expired 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.860
 so not because someone sees you with 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.810
 some different ability that you have to 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 make me feel more but I know that I have my 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.660
 children I have use of reason since I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 I was two years in my entire life has 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.330
 been my battery stand and pride or 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.210
 I do not know I'm all for it and I think 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.070
 that everything is more regular and never after 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.260
 to think how difficult it is going to be tomorrow in 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.899
 bihar or feed or load the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.390
 use it not ever video was helped 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.090
 always the instinct of mother takes you to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.659
 to do a lot of things 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 my child is born and as an 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.979
 a little later my dad died 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.979
 how hard to lose friendship 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.869
 mostly because he taught me through 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.869
 of the fight 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.550
 and that country 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.060
 create a vacuum 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.800
 and now for me the crazy man without work 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 It is very exasperating 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.890
 and very sad that people do not trust 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 people with some different capacity 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.750
 it is very difficult 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.900
 and know that you are going to look for work and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.090
 they tell you you know what it is that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.350
 we need nobody and you find out that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.290
 they are still looking for people 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.740
 this is very sad but still I do not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.530
 I give up because I have two or three 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.710
 good angels three a husband and they 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.690
 contain and we will not disappoint I I 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.470
 I would like to write a book that fits you 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.720
 will help you to value what you have 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.080
 and fight to fight for what more 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.660
 you want and so that people with some 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.690
 different capacity then keep going 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:19.080
 fight for what is true 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.080
 this talk I hope you liked it
