00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you're rolling it's a bit different when

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.370 
you're rolling it's a bit different when
your<00:02:00.060> role<00:02:00.209> in<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.719> mean<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.020> original

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
your role in this I mean the original

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
your role in this I mean the original
one<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.770> keep<00:02:02.009> picking<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.429> so<00:02:02.670> much<00:02:02.819> pace

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
one you keep picking up so much pace

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.399 
one you keep picking up so much pace
when<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.569> down<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> Brandon<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.289> go

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
when you go down the Brandon you go

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.089 
when you go down the Brandon you go
flown<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.849> you<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.239> go<00:02:06.420> flying

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
flown and if you don't really go flying

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.100 
flown and if you don't really go flying
when<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.489> down<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> little<00:02:09.000> ramp<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.869> sort

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
when you go down a little ramp you sort

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
when you go down a little ramp you sort
of<00:02:10.229> slow<00:02:11.009> down<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> bit<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.790> down<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
of slow down a bit when you get down to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.880 
of slow down a bit when you get down to
the<00:02:12.150> bottom<00:02:12.329> and<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.170> could<00:02:13.530> go<00:02:13.709> ahead<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the bottom and so could go ahead a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.479 
the bottom and so could go ahead a
consistent<00:02:14.670> fast<00:02:15.090> pace<00:02:15.890> which<00:02:16.890> means<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.340> get

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
consistent fast pace which means I get

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.199 
consistent fast pace which means I get
as<00:02:17.579> much<00:02:17.700> speed<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.329> ramp<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.849> one<00:02:20.849> I

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
as much speed up a ramp and one I

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.020 
as much speed up a ramp and one I
suppose<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.140> great<00:02:22.819> thing<00:02:23.819> with<00:02:23.940> this

on<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:37.280> don't<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.489> got<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.630> score<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.079> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
on I don't think I got this score at the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.949 
on I don't think I got this score at the
start<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.609> I've<00:02:41.609> managed<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.150> 90,000

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
start but I've managed to get 90,000

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.750 
start but I've managed to get 90,000
points1<00:02:43.470> time<00:02:45.260> orcs<00:02:46.260> got<00:02:46.739> our<00:02:46.950> games<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.639> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
points1 time orcs got our games have the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.160 
points1 time orcs got our games have the
different<00:02:48.090> scoring<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:49.019> that's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
different scoring but I think that's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.720 
different scoring but I think that's
ridiculous<00:02:49.709> getting<00:02:50.010> ninety<00:02:50.310> thousand

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
ridiculous getting ninety thousand

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490 
ridiculous getting ninety thousand
points<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.480> first<00:02:51.720> level<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.290> just

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
points on the first level it's just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.920 
points on the first level it's just
ridiculous<00:02:56.030> yeah<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.389> Master<00:02:57.750> System

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
ridiculous yeah on the Master System

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.650 
ridiculous yeah on the Master System
version<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.739> think<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.579> highest<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.630> highest

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
version I think the highest the highest

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.750 
version I think the highest the highest
possible<00:03:01.380> score<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.950> I've<00:03:02.040> ever<00:03:02.280> got<00:03:02.519> is

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
possible score that I've ever got is

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.849 
possible score that I've ever got is
30,000<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.900> that's<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.139> highest<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
30,000 I think that's the highest you

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.420 
30,000 I think that's the highest you
can<00:03:04.889> never<00:03:05.130> get<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:07.019> 90,000<00:03:07.769> that's<00:03:08.040> three

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
can never get in 90,000 that's three

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.849 
can never get in 90,000 that's three
times<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.970> having<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:10.500> doesn't<00:03:10.769> really

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
times that having it doesn't really

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.379 
times that having it doesn't really
sound<00:03:11.069> like<00:03:11.220> much<00:03:11.489> an<00:03:11.639> achievement<00:03:12.000> at<00:03:12.239> all

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
sound like much an achievement at all

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.420 
sound like much an achievement at all
it's<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.230> high<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:15.799> basically<00:03:16.799> how<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it's just so high and basically how this

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.940 
it's just so high and basically how this
our<00:03:17.790> swim<00:03:18.329> petrol<00:03:18.780> game<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.169> structured<00:03:19.620> same

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
our swim petrol game is structured same

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.570 
our swim petrol game is structured same
as<00:03:20.130> our<00:03:20.930> signed<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.109> Hedgehog<00:03:22.470> one

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
as our signed the Hedgehog one

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.080 
as our signed the Hedgehog one
but<00:03:24.210> yeah<00:03:24.360> what<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.110> have

but yeah what do you have is you have
six<00:03:27.090> levels<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.780> 3x<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:29.370> each<00:03:29.760> level<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:31.320> that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
six levels and 3x in each level so that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.660 
six levels and 3x in each level so that
goes<00:03:32.520> down<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.940> approximately<00:03:33.770> 18<00:03:34.770> yeah<00:03:35.280> 18

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670

easier than this this one way harder I

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.349 
easier than this this one way harder I
found<00:04:13.250> I'm<00:04:14.250> not<00:04:14.400> sure<00:04:14.580> if<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.790> are<00:04:15.470> your<00:04:16.470> mark

really the last three acts I mean this
still<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> bit<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> challenge<00:04:54.900> however

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
still is a bit of a challenge however

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.930 
still is a bit of a challenge however
compared<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:57.840> game<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.290> games<00:04:58.940> it's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
compared to this game is games it's

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.189 
compared to this game is games it's
twice<00:05:00.240> as<00:05:00.270> hard<00:05:00.600> early
