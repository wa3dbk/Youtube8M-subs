for the connector if you find a little

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.469 
for the connector if you find a little
black<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> nice<00:01:10.430> so

black one like this it's kind of nice so

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.490 
black one like this it's kind of nice so
that's<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.920> can't<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.500> play

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

anything<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> guess

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
anything here I guess

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.910 
anything here I guess
I<00:01:19.090> think<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.600> YouTube<00:01:21.020> is<00:01:21.200> not<00:01:21.320> allowing<00:01:21.770> that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
I think the YouTube is not allowing that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.230 
I think the YouTube is not allowing that
so<00:01:23.230> that's<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.620> will<00:01:24.860> step<00:01:25.700> out<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.000> car

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
so that's it I will step out of the car

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:45.200 
so that's it I will step out of the car
do<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.720> guys<00:01:26.900> can<00:01:27.170> see

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.080
