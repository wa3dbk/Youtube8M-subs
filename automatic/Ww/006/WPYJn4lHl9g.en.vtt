00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.670
 I was watching a video that teaches you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.330
 how to make videos supports how to make 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.810
 supports for your cell phone 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.740
 using things like that 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.130
 it is enough to spend 200 300 dollars in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.919
 phones that look at each other 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.259
 and so and after spending so much money 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.560
 on your phone 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.859
 let's use that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 to ride it on your bike I think 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.160
 not instead of doing that better buy your 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.190
 post 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.730
 that will take care of your phone that does not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.730
 let it fall 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.610
 and that will work when before in your 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610
 motorcycle or on your bike 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 this I understand the dotcom ethics by 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.770
 39 95 the mountain of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.820
 phone and a mold for your bicycle 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.820
 do not talk back 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.330
 here is your phone if you want to change 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.960
 Easy phone with us while a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.120
 new phone on the same mount this 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
 Monte is universal work with any 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.880
 phone 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.640
 here you press it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 and back 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.359
 you close them 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.680
 make sure it is properly and so your 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.750
 phone is not going anywhere 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.090
 this is something that you want to be money 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.650
 to have your phone if you do not 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.050
 you want to be so much money buying 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.370
 cell phones only to later be in 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.370
 home using this 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.539
 of mount 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.920
 better buy something that you know is 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.870
 guaranteed universal 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 this is the mountain that comes with the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.170
 bike 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.970
 you can use it 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 for gps to drive for any 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.570
 thing you need 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.570
 your phone does not move from here 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.020

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.020
