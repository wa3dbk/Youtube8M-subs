do-it-yourself<00:01:52.200> co2<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:52.920> tank<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.340> now

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
do-it-yourself co2 to my tank right now

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240 
do-it-yourself co2 to my tank right now
when<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.880> T<00:01:54.270> eights<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.899> tank<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> I'm

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
when I have T eights on my tank and I'm

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370 
when I have T eights on my tank and I'm
not<00:01:56.579> dosing<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.840> saying<00:01:58.079> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
not dosing you see what I'm saying so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
not dosing you see what I'm saying so
that<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.420> thing<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that this is the little thing that I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
that this is the little thing that I
made<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.290> row<00:02:01.500> row<00:02:01.649> simple<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> look<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
made up at row row simple and look so

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.240 
made up at row row simple and look so
it's<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> lot<00:02:02.880> easier<00:02:02.909> than<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.360> looks<00:02:03.390> but

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
it's a lot easier than it looks but

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.420 
it's a lot easier than it looks but
there's<00:02:05.250> no<00:02:05.460> exact<00:02:05.880> science<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.390> this

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
there's no exact science to this

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.770 
there's no exact science to this
it<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:08.060> bit<00:02:08.210> more<00:02:08.390> in-depth<00:02:08.690> than

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
it is a little bit more in-depth than

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540 
it is a little bit more in-depth than
most<00:02:08.929> people<00:02:09.229> think<00:02:09.380> or<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.710> for<00:02:10.100> instance<00:02:10.399> if

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
most people think or so for instance if

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.370 
most people think or so for instance if
I<00:02:10.670> have<00:02:10.880> T<00:02:11.870> eights<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.230> my<00:02:12.350> tank<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:14.110> let's<00:02:15.110> just

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
I have T eights on my tank so let's just

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.280 
I have T eights on my tank so let's just
instead<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:15.860> X<00:02:16.040> let's<00:02:16.280> put<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:18.170> we'll

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
instead of X let's put actually we'll

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.380 
instead of X let's put actually we'll
leave<00:02:18.410> X<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> have<00:02:19.430> t<00:02:19.820> eights<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.180> far

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
leave X there so I have t eights as far

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.900 
leave X there so I have t eights as far
as<00:02:20.480> lights<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.440> no<00:02:22.040> nutrients<00:02:22.610> except

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
as lights we have no nutrients except

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
as lights we have no nutrients except
for<00:02:23.090> dirt<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.470> no<00:02:24.830> co2<00:02:25.100> except<00:02:25.670> for

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
for dirt and we have no co2 except for

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.850 
for dirt and we have no co2 except for
the<00:02:25.850> fish<00:02:26.090> we're<00:02:26.750> gonna<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.050> X<00:02:27.350> amount<00:02:27.740> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the fish we're gonna get X amount of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.370 
the fish we're gonna get X amount of
growth<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.490> now<00:02:29.300> let's<00:02:29.959> say<00:02:30.170> for<00:02:30.230> instance

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
growth right now let's say for instance

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.370 
growth right now let's say for instance
I<00:02:30.770> go<00:02:30.980> today<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:32.090> say<00:02:32.300> instead<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.720> thi<00:02:33.230> want

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
I go today and I say instead of thi want

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.320 
I go today and I say instead of thi want
to<00:02:33.410> change<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.800> t5<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.820> I'm<00:02:34.910> upgrading<00:02:35.060> my

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
to change to t5 so I'm upgrading my

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.790 
to change to t5 so I'm upgrading my
lighting<00:02:35.660> substantially<00:02:36.320> let's<00:02:36.530> say<00:02:36.680> it's

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
lighting substantially let's say it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.250 
lighting substantially let's say it's
twice<00:02:37.070> as<00:02:37.130> much<00:02:37.520> 2<00:02:38.480> times<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.930> amount<00:02:39.110> of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
twice as much 2 times the amount of

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.590 
twice as much 2 times the amount of
light<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.860> let's<00:02:40.250> say<00:02:40.430> also<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.060> I'm<00:02:41.180> going

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
light and let's say also that I'm going

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.880 
light and let's say also that I'm going
to<00:02:43.120> change<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.420> nutrients<00:02:45.020> up<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.650> I'm<00:02:45.739> gonna

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to change the nutrients up so I'm gonna

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.640 
to change the nutrients up so I'm gonna
start<00:02:46.160> dosing<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.570> I'm<00:02:47.750> gonna<00:02:48.050> add<00:02:48.230> twice<00:02:48.500> as

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
start dosing so I'm gonna add twice as

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.650 
start dosing so I'm gonna add twice as
much<00:02:48.800> nutrients<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.580> I'm<00:02:50.000> thinking<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.540> by

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
much nutrients and I'm thinking that by

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.240 
much nutrients and I'm thinking that by
doing<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.170> I'm<00:02:51.380> gonna<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.680> twice<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:51.920> much

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
doing that I'm gonna get twice as much

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.690 
doing that I'm gonna get twice as much
growth<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:54.590> doesn't<00:02:54.890> correspond<00:02:55.370> because

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
growth it doesn't correspond because

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.760 
growth it doesn't correspond because
you're<00:02:55.820> missing<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> co2<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.500> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.650> guys

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
you're missing the co2 so if you guys

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.990 
you're missing the co2 so if you guys
see<00:02:57.980> what<00:02:58.100> I'm<00:02:58.190> saying<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.610> would<00:02:58.730> have<00:02:58.850> to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
see what I'm saying you would have to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.550 
see what I'm saying you would have to
then<00:02:59.120> add<00:02:59.300> some<00:02:59.540> type<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.750> co2

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
then add some type of co2

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.150 
then add some type of co2
now<00:03:01.330> what<00:03:02.330> there's<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.200> balance<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.680> every<00:03:03.920> tank

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
now what there's a balance to every tank

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.650 
now what there's a balance to every tank
and<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.400> isn't<00:03:04.550> an<00:03:04.760> exact<00:03:05.120> science<00:03:05.150> body

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
and this isn't an exact science body

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.360 
and this isn't an exact science body
means<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.320> complete<00:03:07.220> it's

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
means and this is complete it's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.060 
means and this is complete it's
just<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.760> show<00:03:07.790> people<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.750> order<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.680> get

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
just to show people that in order to get

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.280 
just to show people that in order to get
the<00:03:10.910> growth<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.510> want<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:11.900> your<00:03:11.989> tanks

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
the growth that you want for your tanks

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.580 
the growth that you want for your tanks
you<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.890> add<00:03:13.180> enough<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.570> something<00:03:15.170> so

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
you have to add enough of something so

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.289 
you have to add enough of something so
for<00:03:15.739> instance<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.370> didn't<00:03:16.670> add<00:03:16.760> co2<00:03:17.000> in

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
for instance if you didn't add co2 in

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.300 
for instance if you didn't add co2 in
that<00:03:17.420> situation<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.410> may<00:03:18.650> not<00:03:18.830> see<00:03:19.070> any

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
that situation you may not see any

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
that situation you may not see any
difference<00:03:19.820> in<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.330> your<00:03:20.600> plants

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
difference in your in your plants

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.400 
difference in your in your plants
because<00:03:22.100> maybe<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.610> co2<00:03:23.360> amount<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.260> you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
because maybe the co2 amount that you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.259 
because maybe the co2 amount that you
have<00:03:24.440> from<00:03:24.769> just<00:03:25.040> fish<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.430> your<00:03:25.459> tank<00:03:25.580> isn't

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
have from just fish in your tank isn't

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.900 
have from just fish in your tank isn't
letting<00:03:26.930> your<00:03:27.110> plants<00:03:27.470> use<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.580> amount<00:03:28.850> of

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
letting your plants use the amount of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.160 
letting your plants use the amount of
light<00:03:29.060> they<00:03:29.209> need<00:03:29.239> use<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.900> amount<00:03:30.080> of

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
light they need use the amount of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.330 
light they need use the amount of
nutrients<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.739> then<00:03:30.830> what<00:03:30.980> happens

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
nutrients and then what happens

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.949 
nutrients and then what happens
everybody<00:03:32.060> knows<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.360> everyone's<00:03:32.660> seen<00:03:32.810> on
