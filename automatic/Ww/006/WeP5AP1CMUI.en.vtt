bun on the hair I think this is really

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
bun on the hair I think this is really
pretty<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> those<00:01:22.560> styles

pretty because it's one of those styles

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
pretty because it's one of those styles
that's<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.400> too<00:01:23.640> perfect<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.630> looks<00:01:25.290> it's

that's not too perfect it looks it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
that's not too perfect it looks it's
supposed<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.400> bit<00:01:26.640> Messier<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
supposed to be a little bit Messier so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.050 
supposed to be a little bit Messier so
don't<00:01:27.630> worry<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:28.229> getting<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.549> perfect

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
don't worry about getting it too perfect

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so you'll put about five or six pins

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.020 
so you'll put about five or six pins
