it doesn't go side to side so that's the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.630 
it doesn't go side to side so that's the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
three of the figures that we're getting

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.380 
three of the figures that we're getting
from<00:06:02.210> wave<00:06:02.570> one<00:06:03.100> Superman<00:06:04.100> of<00:06:04.340> course<00:06:04.640> is<00:06:04.910> just

a great figure I mean I you know it's
Superman<00:06:07.550> but<00:06:08.090> other<00:06:08.480> than<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:08.780> if<00:06:09.770> that's

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
Superman but other than that if that's

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.580 
Superman but other than that if that's
tough<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.120> determine<00:06:11.240> which<00:06:11.720> one<00:06:11.990> of<00:06:12.170> the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
tough to determine which one of the

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.470 
tough to determine which one of the
three<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.920> my<00:06:13.010> favorite<00:06:13.040> because<00:06:13.430> all<00:06:13.880> three
