00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.169
 hi everyone for this new 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.720
 video on the poke me no I tell you 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:11.559
 how do we use the link and so 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.389
 buying but in town in normal what I 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.990
 the muse a little bit in the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.109
 workouts and or so wellink that's 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 who makes friends we will withdraw his 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.349
 immediately the line how to use 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.300
 we have the connection he succeeds the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 internet connection and wireless networks 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.540
 so you read on the wireless 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 you have the calf leaves to speak 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.520
 with friends and there you have and link 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 so there cyril teleported would have unique 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.500
 so where for two dimensions zarbi 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.110
 we will say here we are going to say that I have 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 well advanced since I have it 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.310
 only usable if you have any 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.810
 players close to you so there you 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.660
 go on the bridge so the map 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.290
 available for the inc so that's it 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.390
 look here I see that there is a player 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.970
 then he will be obligatorily on the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.570
 next to old bones islands alongside center 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.190
 so diagonal geek so saw that the ania a 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.940
 player cross the bridge so su 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.130
 in the in the side of kate and william 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.530
 of course if you have the version 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.210
 black the nuc market only with the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 white version and well the black version 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.430
 and not the white version of and the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.780
 gold version 2 after his pole to his art of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.150
 dislike I do not know because 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 I did not have to follow 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.710
 maybe gfa runners so very well the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
 lazarois taste buds at first if you 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.380
 if you begin, how does it work? 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.979
 pass and everything before end of mission 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.430
 so to you press a then you 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.260
 were led trick they say accept a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.000
 mission then you choose a 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.799
 mission so here it takes not where he has 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.370
 put everything sell me I'm going to make a 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:10.350
 simple mission 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:14.310
 a fight of course that's it 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 and tell you this in relation to your 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.430
 mission the time allotted for doing 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.680
 this mission is the reward you 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.690
 so get there you notice how 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.940
 these missions beginning of the mission not 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.560
 will not sing the mission began 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.020
 there you m the time that remains 0 aymon the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.460
 mission of the pivots the word fight of 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.490
 pokemon in the team nor adjust me 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.500
 level 10 so you transform after 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.260
 so there you have the time down that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.480
 fall here you have the map 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.280
 Williams is here so you press 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.610
 on the destination to teleport you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 so yes he 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.840
 yes unless elsewhere 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:18.880
 here he is then where else is there then 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.140
 yes I find that what I am like a 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.440
 ghost what will happen is that I 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.440
 will talk to him 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.030
 how he accepts so there you have 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.210
 makes a herbie size fighter 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 hancock heels Sunday grid with two 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.800
 pokemon of the opponent against you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.520
 so she bio is sent by william 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.630
 good pokemon reshiram so hand outstretched 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.030
 I took the first two pokemon in 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.690
 my team that are added at level 10 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.690
 while pointing 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.510
 but this business fight because what 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.870
 good thing is that once put to 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.480
 girls 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.870
 I believe that if you lose it comes back 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.269
 the same avatar will brandish more and more 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.340
 and maybe that's going to make you a 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.250
 development 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.419
 when I finish the tree 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.290
 finally if it stops growing or not 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.669
 I would have earned enough water friis do 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.210
 well I'll do a video on the end of 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.210
 week the object 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.640
 yes long rates 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:05.510
 go will i am on attack to his refusals 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:09.640
 facing these levels then says and that's it 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:21.140
 already makes a pokemon of death let's see 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:26.150
 his second pokemon kovalchuk at 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:30.080
 bun more we will reserve him a 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.980
 little woman crosses and it is possible and 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.980
 Well no it will not be possible 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.840
 monterey bay of the war we will play it 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:45.500
 in pokemon light and heard him too 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.700
 level 10 so I translate zekrom I 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.020
 might do a next video on 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.970
 the source at the site 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.680
 I had cramps by the exchange 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.260
 world by all pokemon games so 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.980
 I will make a video about it for you 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.980
 show how it works 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.900
 rim attack or kourichi what to rage 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.760
 near the disaster 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.020
 go ahead put him there then I heard at 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.330
 levels without so I unlocked 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.850
 according sana attacks loaded name 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.030
 she avoided 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.450
 so that's what I call the bowl 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.450
 really a lot of bowl 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:28.669
 that's where you see it's this 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:33.530
 which we call being in the in the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:35.990
 cave then there I was looking for 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:44.330
 shooters to try to change from 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:49.419
 this situation when to say no one to go 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.030
 see the end of time as you see there 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.849
 I lost certainly I had not seen that they 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.220
 have time it's a mistake 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:01.130
 basic let's say so advise 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.330
 always kept here is the time we 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.220
 should not have a real fight not 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.570
 Williams won then was a pius 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.599
 fight choice 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.310
 thank you for agreeing to the next 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:15.740
 so the mission fight challenge williams 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.599
 and lakes 10 feel complete so since 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.729
 I lost yes the mission is accomplished 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.800
 why because I was proud williams 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:24.889
 where you got happiness from and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.220
 mick versus whites accumulate 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.349
 2 1 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.690
 and there you see there years who grew up 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.220
 I once again then once 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.460
 finished mission you recover 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.949
 normally so there you are in 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.120
 the elite in your and lync and for 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:44.020
 come back now badly turned this 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.020
 little and the orange bearers and that's it 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:51.779
 it's good, well, we're back 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.550
 for next videos moment the 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.830
 next it will be on the gts but after 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:59.990
 frankly no more time thank you 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.990
 to have looked and has more
