technique is important start on a flat
terrain<00:02:40.770> as<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:41.190> getting<00:02:41.280> used<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
terrain as you're getting used to the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.490 
terrain as you're getting used to the
skiing<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.330> bumps<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.470> not

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
skiing in the bumps so that you're not

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.350 
skiing in the bumps so that you're not
so<00:02:43.740> much<00:02:43.860> worried<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.190> your<00:02:44.400> speed<00:02:44.760> but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
so much worried about your speed but

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
so much worried about your speed but
more<00:02:45.510> focused<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.050> your<00:02:46.200> rhythm<00:02:46.530> flat<00:02:47.040> terrain

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
more focused on your rhythm flat terrain

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.610 
more focused on your rhythm flat terrain
with<00:02:47.610> bumps<00:02:47.970> work<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.720> keeping<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:49.050> two<00:02:49.320> skis

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
with bumps work on keeping your two skis

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.970 
with bumps work on keeping your two skis
together<00:02:50.060> moving<00:02:51.060> together<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.620> biggest

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
together moving together and the biggest

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.590 
together moving together and the biggest
thing<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.310> keeping<00:02:53.610> your<00:02:53.760> torso<00:02:53.970> always

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
thing is keeping your torso always

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.840 
thing is keeping your torso always
facing<00:02:54.990> downhill<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.340> your<00:02:56.490> lower<00:02:56.670> half

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
facing downhill so that your lower half

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.060 
facing downhill so that your lower half
can<00:02:57.330> move<00:02:57.480> independent<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.770> upper<00:02:59.040> half

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
can move independent of your upper half

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.120 
can move independent of your upper half
to<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.870> biggest<00:03:01.080> tip<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.920> keep

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
to do this the biggest tip is to keep

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.460 
to do this the biggest tip is to keep
your<00:03:02.280> hands<00:03:02.490> forward<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.270> together<00:03:03.780> like

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
your hands forward and together like

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.050 
your hands forward and together like
they're<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.740> steering<00:03:05.250> wheel<00:03:05.280> way<00:03:05.790> out<00:03:05.940> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
they're on a steering wheel way out in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.900 
they're on a steering wheel way out in
front<00:03:06.120> it'll<00:03:06.990> keep<00:03:07.200> your<00:03:07.890> shins<00:03:08.280> into<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
front it'll keep your shins into the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.850 
front it'll keep your shins into the
front<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.209> your<00:03:09.300> boots<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.810> I'll<00:03:10.560> keep<00:03:10.709> your

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
front of your boots and I'll keep your

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.990 
front of your boots and I'll keep your
weight<00:03:11.040> forward<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.670> ski<00:03:11.850> on<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
weight forward so you can ski on the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640 
weight forward so you can ski on the
front<00:03:12.360> portion<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> ski<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.530> where

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
front portion of the ski which is where

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.199 
front portion of the ski which is where
you<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:13.800> get<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> most<00:03:14.130> resistance<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
you can get the most resistance and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.540 
you can get the most resistance and
friction<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.709> keep<00:03:16.860> your<00:03:16.950> hands<00:03:17.130> forward

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
friction so keep your hands forward

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.830 
friction so keep your hands forward
don't<00:03:18.000> let<00:03:18.150> them<00:03:18.239> stick<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> snow<00:03:18.780> too

don't let them stick in the snow too
long<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.650> pull<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.890> back<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
long so that they pull you back and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.190 
long so that they pull you back and
never<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> screen<00:03:21.540> door<00:03:21.780> opening
