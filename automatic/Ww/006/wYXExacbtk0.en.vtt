00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
anything Disney is good at its having us

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
anything Disney is good at its having us

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
go along with things that don't make

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
go along with things that don't make
sense<00:00:53.699> man<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.719> movie<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.469> well

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
sense man this movie does it pretty well

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.010 
sense man this movie does it pretty well
Geppetto<00:00:56.370> makes<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> puppet<00:00:57.120> boy<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> one

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Geppetto makes a puppet boy which is one

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.779 
Geppetto makes a puppet boy which is one
night<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> he<00:00:58.649> were<00:00:58.800> real<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> Blue

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
night that he were real and the Blue

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.580 
night that he were real and the Blue
Fairy<00:00:59.969> comes<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.510> makes<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> happen<00:01:00.960> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
Fairy comes and makes it happen it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
Fairy comes and makes it happen it's
ironic<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.340> probably<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.239> film<00:01:03.480> should

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
ironic because probably the film should

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.420 
ironic because probably the film should
be<00:01:03.690> centered<00:01:04.049> around<00:01:04.140> Geppetto<00:01:04.739> he's<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> one

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
be centered around Geppetto he's the one

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
be centered around Geppetto he's the one
that<00:01:05.610> has<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> past<00:01:06.180> he's<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that has a past he's the one that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.990 
that has a past he's the one that
actually<00:01:07.110> has<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.740> character<00:01:08.220> Pinocchio<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
actually has some character Pinocchio is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
actually has some character Pinocchio is
just<00:01:09.210> sort<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> born<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.110> his<00:01:10.260> personality

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
just sort of born with his personality

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
just sort of born with his personality
so<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.700> fact<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> learn<00:01:12.689> lessons

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so the fact that he has to learn lessons

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
so the fact that he has to learn lessons
and<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.680> given<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> conscience<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> kind<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and be given a conscience is kind of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
and be given a conscience is kind of
strange<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.869> Blue<00:01:16.020> Fairy<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.470> sort

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
strange because the Blue Fairy just sort

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
strange because the Blue Fairy just sort
of<00:01:16.680> made<00:01:16.950> him<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.430> didn't<00:01:17.820> she<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> want

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of made him up didn't she if you want

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
of made him up didn't she if you want
him<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> learn<00:01:19.020> lessons<00:01:19.290> why<00:01:19.710> didn't<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.289

have<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> where<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> lessons<00:01:21.030> were<00:01:21.119> already

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have it where the lessons were already

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539
