in<00:00:07.990> this<00:00:08.990> demo<00:00:09.410> we're<00:00:09.830> going<00:00:09.860> to<00:00:10.160> create<00:00:10.370> a

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
in this demo we're going to create a

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.299 
in this demo we're going to create a
simple<00:00:10.730> morph<00:00:11.150> animation<00:00:11.889> let's<00:00:12.889> start<00:00:13.190> with

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
simple morph animation let's start with

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.810 
simple morph animation let's start with
a<00:00:13.340> background<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.280> first<00:00:16.520> thing<00:00:16.699> I'm

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
a background and the first thing I'm

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.000 
a background and the first thing I'm
going<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.000> do<00:00:17.180> is<00:00:17.990> I'm<00:00:18.260> going<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.500> add<00:00:18.680> an

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
going to do is I'm going to add an

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.920 
going to do is I'm going to add an
Autobot<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.140> animation<00:00:21.680> panel<00:00:22.930> Roboto

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
Autobot to the animation panel Roboto

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.830 
Autobot to the animation panel Roboto
comes<00:00:24.800> with<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.400> number<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:25.940> different<00:00:26.150> kinds

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
comes with a number of different kinds

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.790 
comes with a number of different kinds
of<00:00:27.170> Autobots<00:00:27.800> these<00:00:28.760> are<00:00:29.800> procedural

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
of Autobots these are procedural

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.260 
of Autobots these are procedural
entities<00:00:31.640> they<00:00:32.059> are<00:00:33.280> they<00:00:34.280> generate<00:00:34.730> geometry

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
entities they are they generate geometry

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.549 
entities they are they generate geometry
with<00:00:35.629> a<00:00:35.660> number<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.200> different

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
with a number of different

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.910 
with a number of different
characteristics<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:39.140> this<00:00:39.289> case<00:00:39.530> I'm

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
characteristics and in this case I'm

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.950 
characteristics and in this case I'm
going<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.130> add<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.610> pinwheel<00:00:41.239> Autobot<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.840> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
going to add a pinwheel Autobot to the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.260 
going to add a pinwheel Autobot to the
animation<00:00:42.530> panel<00:00:43.960> for<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.020> first<00:00:45.320> keyframe

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
animation panel for this first keyframe

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.660 
animation panel for this first keyframe
we<00:00:47.270> move<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.720> bot<00:00:48.170> up<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.560> little<00:00:48.710> bit<00:00:48.920> above

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
we move the bot up a little bit above

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.580 
we move the bot up a little bit above
the<00:00:49.960> background<00:00:50.960> scene<00:00:51.230> geometry<00:00:53.350> I'm<00:00:54.350> also

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
the background scene geometry I'm also

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.710 
the background scene geometry I'm also
going<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.890> rotate<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.280> just<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:56.420> get<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.630> little

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
going to rotate it just to get a little

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.639 
going to rotate it just to get a little
more<00:00:56.899> perspective<00:00:57.170> on<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.739> bottom<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:59.649> now

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
more perspective on this bottom and now

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.880 
more perspective on this bottom and now
we're<00:01:00.829> going<00:01:00.950> to<00:01:01.010> shift<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.239> drag<00:01:03.079> the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
we're going to shift and drag the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.139 
we're going to shift and drag the
keyframe<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.820> create<00:01:05.239> several<00:01:05.869> instances<00:01:06.229> of

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
keyframe to create several instances of

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.700 
keyframe to create several instances of
this<00:01:08.149> keyframe<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.840> animate<00:01:09.140> panel<00:01:09.439> four

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
this keyframe and the animate panel four

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.770 
this keyframe and the animate panel four
to<00:01:09.829> be<00:01:09.950> exact

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
to be exact

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.359 
to be exact
now<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:12.079> morph<00:01:12.289> between<00:01:12.409> any<00:01:12.829> different

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
now you can morph between any different

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.069 
now you can morph between any different
kind<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.670> auto<00:01:13.819> botanist<00:01:14.329> in<00:01:14.539> this<00:01:14.689> example

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
kind of auto botanist in this example

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.069 
kind of auto botanist in this example
we're<00:01:15.319> actually<00:01:15.469> kind<00:01:15.859> of<00:01:15.950> morphing<00:01:16.280> between

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
we're actually kind of morphing between

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.379 
we're actually kind of morphing between
four<00:01:18.079> instances<00:01:18.409> of<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.829> same<00:01:19.039> bot<00:01:19.389> which

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389 
four instances of the same bot which

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:21.609 
four instances of the same bot which
allows<00:01:20.659> us<00:01:20.840> actually<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.289> do<00:01:21.409> some

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
allows us actually to do some

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.239 
allows us actually to do some
interesting<00:01:21.859> things<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:24.649> can<00:01:24.770> see<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.100> each

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
interesting things you can see that each

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.279 
interesting things you can see that each
bought<00:01:26.209> instance<00:01:26.659> has<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> number<00:01:27.200> of

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
bought instance has a number of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.649 
bought instance has a number of
different<00:01:27.590> parameters<00:01:28.090> in<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.209> case<00:01:29.450> I'll

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
different parameters in this case I'll

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.330 
different parameters in this case I'll
going<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> second<00:01:30.380> keyframe<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.249> I'm

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
going to the second keyframe and I'm

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.469 
going to the second keyframe and I'm
going<00:01:31.459> to<00:01:31.520> change<00:01:31.819> a<00:01:31.969> couple<00:01:31.999> of<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
going to change a couple of the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.669 
going to change a couple of the
parameters<00:01:33.139> which<00:01:33.319> control<00:01:33.740> its<00:01:33.950> geometry

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
parameters which control its geometry

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.899 
parameters which control its geometry
changing<00:01:36.679> here<00:01:36.859> in<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.979> twist<00:01:37.249> angle<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:37.759> the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
changing here in the twist angle and the

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.089 
changing here in the twist angle and the
branch<00:01:38.270> angle<00:01:38.719> of<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:38.990> instance<00:01:39.859> of<00:01:40.009> the

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
branch angle of this instance of the

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.749 
branch angle of this instance of the
bottom<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.549> second<00:01:40.880> keyframe<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.829> because

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
bottom the second keyframe and because

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.609 
bottom the second keyframe and because
this<00:01:43.939> will<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.209> morphing<00:01:44.659> overtime<00:01:45.289> I'm<00:01:45.469> also

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
this will be morphing overtime I'm also

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.709 
this will be morphing overtime I'm also
gonna<00:01:45.889> add<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.759> little<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> rotation<00:01:47.689> just

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
gonna add a little bit of rotation just

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.620 
gonna add a little bit of rotation just
to<00:01:48.249> vary<00:01:49.249> eight<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.719> animation<00:01:50.719> that<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:50.959> get<00:01:51.229> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
to vary eight the animation that I get a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.849 
to vary eight the animation that I get a
point<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.779> third<00:01:53.990> keyframe<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.529> gonna<00:01:54.679> do

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
point of the third keyframe I'm gonna do

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.050 
point of the third keyframe I'm gonna do
the<00:01:54.950> same<00:01:55.159> thing<00:01:55.429> I'm<00:01:55.579> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.789> change<00:01:55.969> a

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
the same thing I'm going to change a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.129 
the same thing I'm going to change a
couple<00:01:56.299> different<00:01:56.539> parameters<00:01:56.959> here<00:01:58.090> and

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
couple different parameters here and

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.719 
couple different parameters here and
notice<00:02:00.139> that<00:02:00.289> I'm<00:02:00.439> just<00:02:00.709> dragging<00:02:01.399> these

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
notice that I'm just dragging these

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.699 
notice that I'm just dragging these
sliders<00:02:02.029> and<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.329> bot<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.049> updating<00:02:03.469> in<00:02:03.560> real

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
sliders and the bot is updating in real

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:10.050 
sliders and the bot is updating in real
time<00:02:06.459> okay<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:07.489> now<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:07.909> have<00:02:08.200> four<00:02:09.200> keyframes

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
time okay so now I have four keyframes

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.540 
time okay so now I have four keyframes
and<00:02:11.060> are<00:02:11.239> gonna<00:02:11.360> make<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.500> so-called<00:02:12.950> bot

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and are gonna make this a so-called bot

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.820 
and are gonna make this a so-called bot
settings<00:02:14.030> type<00:02:14.330> more<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.110> morph<00:02:15.650> between

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
settings type more we can morph between

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.790 
settings type more we can morph between
the<00:02:16.430> object<00:02:16.940> positions<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.630> each<00:02:17.780> spot<00:02:18.080> or<00:02:18.500> we

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
the object positions of each spot or we

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.070 
the object positions of each spot or we
can<00:02:18.980> morph<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> actual<00:02:19.700> parameters<00:02:20.240> which

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
can morph the actual parameters which

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
are used to generate the bot and that's

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.430 
are used to generate the bot and that's
the<00:02:23.420> type<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.660> morph<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.050> we're<00:02:24.320> gonna

behavior that you see here now I can not
only<00:02:41.870> animate<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.210> changes<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
only animate the changes to the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.510 
only animate the changes to the
parameters<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.140> each<00:02:45.410> bot<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.160> each<00:02:46.280> keyframe

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.390 
parameters of each bot in each keyframe
but<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.150> also<00:02:47.300> change<00:02:47.660> things<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
but I can also change things like and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.790 
but I can also change things like and
animate<00:02:49.850> over<00:02:50.090> time<00:02:50.300> things<00:02:50.600> like<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
animate over time things like the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.620 
animate over time things like the

to<00:02:53.900> generate<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.410> bots<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.770> that's<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.070> I'm

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
to generate the bots so that's what I'm

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.700 
to generate the bots so that's what I'm
doing<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:55.520> I'm<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> each<00:02:56.210> keyframe<00:02:56.710> and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
doing now I'm going to each keyframe and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.750 
doing now I'm going to each keyframe and
I'm<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:57.980> going<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.190> pick<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> different

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
I'm just going to pick a different

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.740 
I'm just going to pick a different
gradient<00:02:59.720> set<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.620> colors<00:03:01.040> for<00:03:01.610> each<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:02.390> these

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
gradient set of colors for each of these

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:12.610 
gradient set of colors for each of these
BOTS<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:11.360> when<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.540> preview<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.140> can<00:03:12.170> you'll

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
BOTS now when I preview you can you'll

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.330 
BOTS now when I preview you can you'll
see<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.300> color<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.450> also<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:15.340> transition

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
see that the color is also a transition

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.770 
see that the color is also a transition
between<00:03:16.430> each<00:03:16.790> key<00:03:17.030> frame<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.810> animates

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
between each key frame as it animates

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.230 
between each key frame as it animates
now<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.840> make<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.850> animation<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.880> little<00:03:23.090> more

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
now to make this animation a little more

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.430 
now to make this animation a little more
interesting<00:03:23.750> we're<00:03:23.900> also<00:03:24.020> going<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.260> add<00:03:24.410> some

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
interesting we're also going to add some

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.250 
interesting we're also going to add some
camera<00:03:24.950> movement<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.910> that's<00:03:26.540> really<00:03:26.900> simple

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
camera movement and that's really simple

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.280 
camera movement and that's really simple
to<00:03:27.350> do<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.650> Roboto<00:03:28.010> all<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.910> do<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.290> go

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
to do in Roboto all I have to do is go

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.780 
to do in Roboto all I have to do is go
to<00:03:30.320> each<00:03:30.440> keyframe<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.370> adjust<00:03:31.670> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
to each keyframe and just adjust the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.070 
to each keyframe and just adjust the
camera<00:03:32.060> however<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:32.989> will

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
camera however I like and it will

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.320 
camera however I like and it will
automatically<00:03:33.620> interpolate<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.120> case

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
automatically interpolate in this case

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.560 
automatically interpolate in this case
I'm<00:03:35.510> going<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.750> zoom<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.110> or<00:03:36.380> actually<00:03:37.100> pan<00:03:37.570> in

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
I'm going to zoom in or actually pan in

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.590 
I'm going to zoom in or actually pan in
a<00:03:38.630> little<00:03:38.840> closer<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.320> first<00:03:39.560> two<00:03:39.739> keyframe

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
a little closer the first two keyframe

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.479 
a little closer the first two keyframe
the<00:03:41.600> second<00:03:41.989> one<00:03:42.110> I'm<00:03:42.230> gonna<00:03:42.410> rotate<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
the second one I'm gonna rotate the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:51.400 
the second one I'm gonna rotate the
camera<00:03:43.760> around<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.959> little<00:03:45.050> bit<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:50.050> then<00:03:51.050> here

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
camera around a little bit and then here

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.720 
camera around a little bit and then here
I'm<00:03:51.530> going<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.709> also<00:03:52.070> change<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.519> camera

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
I'm going to also change the camera

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.120 
I'm going to also change the camera
position<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.350> give<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> little<00:03:54.800> variation

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
position just to give a little variation

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.850 
position just to give a little variation
as<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.700> animates<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.930> program<00:03:57.320> will<00:03:57.560> take

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
as this animates the program will take

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.770 
as this animates the program will take
care<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.160> interpolating<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.000> camera

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
care of interpolating the camera

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.320 
care of interpolating the camera
location<00:04:00.140> smoothly<00:04:00.650> as<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:01.850> see<00:04:02.060> here

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
location smoothly as you can see here

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.270 
location smoothly as you can see here
where<00:04:02.450> now<00:04:02.600> we're<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:03.019> little<00:04:03.739> bit<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.070> camera

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
where now we're a little bit of camera

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.270 
where now we're a little bit of camera
motion<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.820> makes<00:04:05.000> things<00:04:05.769> more<00:04:06.769> compelling<00:04:07.250> a

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
motion it makes things more compelling a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.460 
motion it makes things more compelling a
little<00:04:07.459> more<00:04:07.610> interesting<00:04:11.110> okay<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.350> looks

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
little more interesting okay that looks

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.790 
little more interesting okay that looks
good

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
good

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.070 
good
now<00:04:13.550> we're<00:04:13.670> ready<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.910> add<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.510> render<00:04:14.840> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
final output first thing I do is enable

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.520 
final output first thing I do is enable
cropping<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.540> way<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.109> define<00:04:21.500> a
