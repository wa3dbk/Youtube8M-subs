00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi there, bounty hunter 3031 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.250
 This video review on the star wars figure 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.830
 boba fett in the cloudy town from the farm to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.110
 To tobacco, I myself firm known for its 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.020
 art figures flex plus series 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.529
 this figure is made on a scale of one to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.170
 ten 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.449
 but kotobukia firms do models 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 scale one to ten and models in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.960
 one to six scale 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 one to six scale models 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.099
 a little more expensive and they are made a little 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.510
 better this figure 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 have two pairs of interchangeable hands first pair and 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 the second pair that allows you to put 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 model and bean fett in two poses 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 which are depicted on the box these poses i 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'll show you on the box a little later 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.190
 because I want to talk now 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.520
 only 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.629
 and the bean fette figure in detail for sure 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.270
 reproduced bottom 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.270
 figurines only moving head 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 a raincoat that can be removed and the designator 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.280
 which bends on the right shoulder of the bean 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 fett 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.350
 depicts the bounty hunters symbol 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.880
 attached to the feet of the figurine magnet 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.000
 Well, on the stand itself there is also a magnet 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.950
 manufacturer 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.400
 it made to figure 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.939
 held tight and did not fall well 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 The first version of the figure will consider 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.450
 all sides 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:55.350
 Bracers performed perfectly to find fault with 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:55.350
 nothing holster everything is beautifully painted 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.400
 figure worthy of praise well if someone does not 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.400
 knows what art &amp; fix plus is 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.330
 I'll explain a little bit of artov to you now and x 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.690
 plus itâ€™s a figure 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 it is easy to assemble without glue and beauty 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.100
 figure head removed his hands well 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.990
 some can even shoot legs and 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 there may be changes of the head as for example 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.990
 dart maul from the same company cat letter 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.870
 he has two pairs of interchangeable hands and a head 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.240
 also his darth vader only he has yet 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.380
 changing legs and so darth vader stands 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.690
 more expensive than bean fett or dart mole well 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.720
 all the little things are done because 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.450
 differently may not be so 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.620
 scale figures speaks for itself here 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:03:00.989
 how does the second option bean fett and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.989
 Now I will show you so 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.340
 take the figure 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.620
 so here's the cloak dropped nothing and take off our hands 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:23.620
 that's how it all gets attached 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:35.620
 so still a little tweak attach 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:39.830
 sometimes it is quite difficult well, nothing 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 so sorry that there were small 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.480
 This is often the case because 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 i put on my lessons wrong right at the beginning 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:04:00.280
 put this hand on right oh sorry so 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.959
 and now so here 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:24.610
 put on a raincoat and everything is ready the second option 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:29.380
 figurines once again apologize for the small 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:32.669
 problems with the hands well, I say it again 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.669
 done and real 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:43.389
 Well, now consider the box that went 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:52.150
 at the beginning of the review thing box beautiful 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:54.690
 here artov and x plus star symbol 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.410
 wars boba fett in the normal version 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:05.020
 cloudy city one to ten mouse there 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:08.259
 the rear shows all the poses to the exits in 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.389
 the box itself has instructions on how it is 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.720
 collected but it seems to me that anyone will understand how 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:20.250
 collect it only a fool does not understand how 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.250
 I want to collect it I want to consider it 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:37.070
 everything is beautiful perfect even so 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.470
