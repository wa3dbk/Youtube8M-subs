some more strawberries here basically

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.649 
some more strawberries here basically
all<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> cut<00:01:54.270> off<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> top

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
all it is is you just cut off the top

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
all it is is you just cut off the top
leaving<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> something<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
leaving you kind of something like this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.969 
leaving you kind of something like this
as<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.149> wield<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.689> knife<00:01:57.899> safely<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
as I wield this knife safely in the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
as I wield this knife safely in the
kitchen<00:01:59.340> come<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.149> strawberry<00:02:00.479> chunks<00:02:00.689> like

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
kitchen come on strawberry chunks like

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.569 
kitchen come on strawberry chunks like
that<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.219> even<00:02:02.369> come

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that and then you can actually even come

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.420 
that and then you can actually even come
up<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.850> smaller<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.009> blender<00:02:05.310> will

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
up in smaller but the blender will

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.709 
up in smaller but the blender will
probably<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.820> most<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.450> unless<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
probably do most of that so unless you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.910 
probably do most of that so unless you
got<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> big<00:02:07.079> one<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.680> worry<00:02:07.860> about

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
