00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
blending solution so I can just dip my

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
blending solution so I can just dip my
pencil<00:01:47.850> stub<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.450> instead<00:01:49.410> of<00:01:49.710> dipping<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
pencil stub in it instead of dipping it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
pencil stub in it instead of dipping it
straight<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> pot<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:52.050> as<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> see

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
straight into the pot and as you can see

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.360 
straight into the pot and as you can see
i'm<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:53.100> using<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> solution<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.660> blend

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
i'm just using that solution to blend

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.750 
i'm just using that solution to blend
the<00:01:56.370> color<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.830> spreads<00:01:59.220> out<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
the color out and as it spreads out it

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.310 
the color out and as it spreads out it
makes<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.240> lawyer<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.050> look<00:02:01.140> look

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
makes it lawyer to make it look look
