00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 Tripoli 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.710
 I have been a face for the Stuttgart Ballet for 50 years 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.939
 and 22 asks what makes this company so unique 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.939
 Wonder of Stuttgart 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.050
 Moving around here like in Stuttgart is against something I do not know what that is 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.410
 exaggerated said that is a certain magic of this word 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 of course there is no franc «He is a fabulous one 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 for the piece of the old market hall 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.500
 was finished for our sake 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 incredible and it started 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 1961 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.899
 Briton John Cranko becomes director 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.780
 the parish hall 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.640
 we have to see 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.159
 In just a few years the Stuttgart ballet Thunder succeeds and drinks 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 until 2015 for the international financial crisis 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 I think that this magic could somehow still be in here 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.810
 Walls are 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 John Cranko is not a content Franco was a fantastic cool 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.310
 a very big wish of mine would be if there is the possibility through the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 I would love to spend my own father John Cranko 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.250
 what he would think about his own work at the present time and what 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.300
 still it goes about the company would serve something very important to me 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.580
 and what was very important was the brand new one 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
 you know what's new 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.690
 This piece by Christian Stuff is after the new Stuttgart 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.310
 that I'm on hand among the guys - and not only 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.750
 insane topical is my opinion 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 and we certainly have a production trial to small at most 1 1 400 too 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.289
 that is once the somewhat over-twisted forms of presentation that too 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.740
 the action ballet would have to be a bit on the shoestring so 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.059
 do not take it seriously 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.769
 m generally exaggerated fashion with the typical ballet pantomime 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.449
 deal 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.449
 It can also be a bit crazy if I'm not a nice game 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.149
 the story is 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.639
 he has no questions 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.669
 it is exciting 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.679
 that's just one 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:39.450
 after the jump 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.590
 almost the whole under the placement and sit down 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.819
 at that time you would not see it otherwise 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.549
 so not foreign 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.549
 this is funny 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.760
 Doing it is not always fun but hard work 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 promote and demand is the motto in Stuttgart 5 a sure sense for 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.899
 trends 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.959
 Christian had come together he would now have his followers 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.019
 but somehow 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 therefore has become increasingly important fits 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.869
 and tomato soup is the last third world and Zurich 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.949
 so proud 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.419
 "I've always believed in the market and other artists 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.369
 Marko Feldkirch eye-catcher 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.699
 on monday new york 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:34.629
 so writes 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.719
 long let 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.719
 we have had these accidents 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.290
 The Sisters of División is the one to sing Marko the world over 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.939
 has too many jobs oil values ​​she can not belong to all 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.939
 start at SG Rhetoric now 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.209
 Hann 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.829
 and now the offense will be choreographed 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.249
 unbearable 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.969
 9 yuan 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.749
 maybe that's the credit of Anderson 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.309
 that he did this work in such a classic company 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.970
 Percent that she has made this work possible the work has nowhere else 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.269
 happens in the world in such a classic house 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.190
 Timo must lose here 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.230
 For that reason, I think I stay that way for the movie 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.270
 and we are staying alive 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 and that's what we want to celebrate 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.979
 the SFB cheer 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.979
 Eels in good 12 11 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.399
 not just the notes here for decades 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.870
 Now here are the millennial over 50 years 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.449
 we are nowhere 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.180
 and Stuttgart 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.740
 the central offices far away I know 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740
 with ten stations 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.400
 set the election result 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.650
 and it is always a star 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.259
 in our David Cameron 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 Scheer 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
