00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
firebox and so I did that and man does

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.290 
firebox and so I did that and man does
it<00:02:02.020> make<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.319> fire<00:02:02.530> hot<00:02:02.819> to<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:03.850> point<00:02:03.970> what

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
it make the fire hot to the point what

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.240 
it make the fire hot to the point what
this<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:04.929> almost<00:02:05.200> too<00:02:05.530> hot<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.979> thought

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this is it it's almost too hot I thought

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.790 
this is it it's almost too hot I thought
so<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.789> use<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.810> initially<00:02:08.140> start<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
so I use this to initially start the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.830 
so I use this to initially start the
fire<00:02:09.039> it's<00:02:09.280> kind<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.459> like<00:02:09.580> fireplace<00:02:10.420> bellows

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
fire it's kind of like fireplace bellows

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.900 
fire it's kind of like fireplace bellows
so<00:02:10.990> get<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.260> fire<00:02:11.470> started<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:12.880> I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so get your fire started and then I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.390 
so get your fire started and then I
discovered<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:14.830> burns<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.250> its

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
discovered that this thing burns on its

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.460 
discovered that this thing burns on its
own<00:02:15.520> really<00:02:15.819> nicely<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.990> can<00:02:17.140> opt<00:02:17.380> for

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
own really nicely so you can opt for

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.500 
own really nicely so you can opt for
this<00:02:17.680> or<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.400> you're<00:02:18.520> burning<00:02:18.880> big<00:02:19.209> logs

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
this or not if you're burning big logs

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.839 
this or not if you're burning big logs
you<00:02:19.930> might<00:02:20.140> need<00:02:20.319> what<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> call<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.160> fan<00:02:21.400> turbo

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
you might need what I call the fan turbo

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.059 
you might need what I call the fan turbo
charger<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.110> heated<00:02:23.260> up<00:02:23.349> really<00:02:23.650> quickly

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
charger and it heated up really quickly

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.330 
charger and it heated up really quickly
to<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> even<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> initial<00:02:25.450> yeah<00:02:25.750> yeah<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
expanded steel it's like steel grating

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.559 
expanded steel it's like steel grating
and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.280> hold<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.730> up<00:02:42.790> off<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.150> bottom

of the file cabinet I used terracotta
clay<00:02:46.930> garden<00:02:47.409> pots<00:02:47.620> because<00:02:48.099> they're

clay garden pots because they're

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
clay garden pots because they're
fireproof

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
fireproof

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.420 
fireproof
their<00:02:49.990> fight<00:02:50.260> they're<00:02:50.410> like<00:02:50.560> firebrick<00:02:51.220> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
their fight they're like firebrick and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
their fight they're like firebrick and
we<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> ton<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.210> them<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.810> shed

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.900 
we have a ton of them in the shed
and<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.220> what<00:02:54.370> am<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.490> gonna<00:02:54.610> do<00:02:54.820> with

and I'm like what am I gonna do with
these<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.480> finally<00:02:55.810> realized<00:02:56.170> I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
these and then I finally realized I

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110 
these and then I finally realized I
didn't<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> thought<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:57.490> would<00:02:57.700> have<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.850> go<00:02:57.970> buy

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
didn't I thought I would have to go buy

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.490 
didn't I thought I would have to go buy
some<00:02:58.300> fire<00:02:58.510> brick<00:02:58.750> or<00:02:58.870> something<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.350> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
some fire brick or something and that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.810 
some fire brick or something and that
works<00:02:59.710> perfectly

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.290 

I've<00:03:03.820> been<00:03:04.120> collecting<00:03:04.410> scrap<00:03:05.410> wood<00:03:05.740> once<00:03:06.370> yes

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
I've been collecting scrap wood once yes

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.190 
I've been collecting scrap wood once yes
he<00:03:07.540> has<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:09.330> stashing<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.630> shed<00:03:10.870> in

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
he has and stashing it in the shed in

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200 
he has and stashing it in the shed in
the<00:03:11.380> kitchen<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.100> we've<00:03:12.370> I've<00:03:12.700> been<00:03:12.820> boiling

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
the kitchen and we've I've been boiling

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.570 
the kitchen and we've I've been boiling
all<00:03:13.420> day<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.870> I've<00:03:13.990> barely<00:03:14.350> broke<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> into

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
all day and I've barely broke it into

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.600 
all day and I've barely broke it into
part<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.480> shed<00:03:16.750> here<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.430> kind

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
part of the shed here but this is kind

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.190 
part of the shed here but this is kind
of<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.760> these<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.600> pallet<00:03:20.020> length

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
of a these are this is a pallet length

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.230 
of a these are this is a pallet length
and<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.560> perfect<00:03:20.950> for<00:03:21.100> here<00:03:21.250> because<00:03:21.610> it's

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
and it's perfect for here because it's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and it's perfect for here because it's
the<00:03:22.450> same<00:03:22.690> length<00:03:22.959> as<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.320> trays<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.490> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
the same length as the trays so this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.580 
the same length as the trays so this
goes<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.530> here<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.520> then<00:03:28.239> I've<00:03:29.110> been<00:03:29.350> leaving

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
goes in here and then I've been leaving

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.180 
goes in here and then I've been leaving
this<00:03:29.920> up<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.670> slightly<00:03:31.540> ajar<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:33.040> know<00:03:33.130> you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
this up just slightly ajar you know you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.710 
this up just slightly ajar you know you
could<00:03:33.430> put<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.670> vent<00:03:34.030> down<00:03:34.330> here<00:03:34.630> and

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
could put a vent down here and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720 
could put a vent down here and
adjustable<00:03:35.140> vent<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> wanted<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.700> I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
adjustable vent if you wanted but I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.820 
adjustable vent if you wanted but I
found<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.750> having<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.320> slightly

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
found that just having this slightly

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.699 
found that just having this slightly
open<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.880> pulls<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.390> well<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.500> there's

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
open it pulls really well and there's

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.470 
open it pulls really well and there's
enough<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.220> space<00:03:42.520> there<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:43.270> getting

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
enough of a space there so it's getting

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.309 
enough of a space there so it's getting
some<00:03:43.750> air<00:03:43.989> right<00:03:44.200> right

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.170 

when<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.500> first<00:03:51.829> get<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.159> all<00:03:52.370> built<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:53.060> an

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
when you first get this all built do an

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.050 
when you first get this all built do an
initial<00:03:53.420> burn<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:55.220> water<00:03:55.579> in<00:03:55.909> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
initial burn with just water in the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.819 
initial burn with just water in the
trays<00:03:56.360> because<00:03:56.900> you're<00:03:57.079> going<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> burn<00:03:57.650> off

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
trays because you're going to burn off

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.369 
trays because you're going to burn off
all<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.159> paint<00:03:58.459> that's<00:03:58.670> on<00:03:58.790> here<00:03:59.120> it<00:04:00.019> just

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
all the paint that's on here it just

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.089 
all the paint that's on here it just
peels<00:04:00.650> off<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.530> then<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.650> can<00:04:03.829> scrape

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
peels off this and then you can scrape

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.250 
peels off this and then you can scrape
it<00:04:04.280> down<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.760> then<00:04:04.909> you<00:04:05.090> can<00:04:05.239> put<00:04:05.450> your<00:04:05.480> syrup

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
it down and then you can put your syrup

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.630 
it down and then you can put your syrup
in<00:04:06.349> there<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.590> start<00:04:06.799> going<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.280> here's<00:04:07.489> my

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
in there and start going so here's my

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.390 
in there and start going so here's my
thinking<00:04:07.879> on<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.599> sap<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.530> wood<00:04:10.189> comes

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
thinking on this the sap that wood comes

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640 
thinking on this the sap that wood comes
out<00:04:10.519> of<00:04:10.640> storage<00:04:11.019> goes<00:04:12.019> first<00:04:12.290> into<00:04:12.560> this

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
out of storage goes first into this

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.899 
out of storage goes first into this
preheating<00:04:13.250> pot<00:04:13.489> here

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
preheating pot here

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.349 
preheating pot here
that<00:04:14.780> gets<00:04:15.019> put<00:04:15.230> into<00:04:15.349> here<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.009> the<00:04:16.910> boiling

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
that gets put into here and the boiling

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.960 
that gets put into here and the boiling
set<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:18.019> here<00:04:18.440> gets<00:04:19.160> labeled<00:04:19.579> into<00:04:19.850> our

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
set that's in here gets labeled into our

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.480 
set that's in here gets labeled into our
finished<00:04:20.359> tray<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:21.620> what<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:21.799> do<00:04:21.889> is<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.190> take<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
finished tray so what I do is I take the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.029 
finished tray so what I do is I take the
boiling<00:04:22.880> SAP<00:04:23.090> from<00:04:23.360> here<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.470> put<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> into

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
boiling SAP from here and I put it into

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.870 
boiling SAP from here and I put it into
our<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.190> add<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.760> our<00:04:25.880> finishing<00:04:26.510> tray<00:04:27.880> and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
our I add it to our finishing tray and

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.510 
our I add it to our finishing tray and
then<00:04:29.060> whatever<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.389> take<00:04:29.630> out<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.840> here<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:30.520> fill

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
then whatever I take out of here I fill

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.439 
then whatever I take out of here I fill
it<00:04:31.639> back<00:04:31.789> up<00:04:32.030> from<00:04:33.760> our<00:04:34.760> pot<00:04:35.090> that's

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
it back up from our pot that's

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.250 
it back up from our pot that's
preheating<00:04:36.050> over<00:04:36.139> here

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
preheating over here

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.410 
preheating over here
and<00:04:38.740> that's<00:04:38.860> why<00:04:39.040> I've<00:04:39.130> done<00:04:39.250> all<00:04:39.400> day<00:04:39.430> what<00:04:40.330> we

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
and that's why I've done all day what we

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.420 
and that's why I've done all day what we
do<00:04:40.570> with<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.870> evaporator<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.560> we're<00:04:41.860> removing

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
do with the evaporator is we're removing

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.290 
do with the evaporator is we're removing
water<00:04:42.880> from<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:44.350> SAP<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.760> increases

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
water from the SAP and that increases

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.450 
water from the SAP and that increases
the<00:04:46.540> sugar<00:04:46.750> content<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.380> sugar<00:04:47.560> content<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:48.160> X

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
the sugar content the sugar content is X

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.220 
the sugar content the sugar content is X
and<00:04:48.820> there's<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.030> whole<00:04:49.150> bunch<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.420> water<00:04:49.570> we're

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
and there's a whole bunch of water we're

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.740 
and there's a whole bunch of water we're
boiling<00:04:50.500> off<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:51.040> lot<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.460> water<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:51.970> by

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
boiling off a lot of the water and by

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.960 
boiling off a lot of the water and by
going<00:04:53.080> step<00:04:53.650> by<00:04:53.830> step<00:04:54.100> by<00:04:54.250> step<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.610> go<00:04:54.730> from<00:04:54.940> my

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
going step by step by step I go from my

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.300 
going step by step by step I go from my
pot<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.840> first<00:04:56.170> tray<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.620> second<00:04:57.100> tray

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
pot to the first tray to the second tray

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.150 
pot to the first tray to the second tray
I'm<00:04:57.870> removing<00:04:58.870> more<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.350> more<00:04:59.500> water<00:04:59.890> each

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
I'm removing more and more water each

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.730 
I'm removing more and more water each
time<00:05:00.930> that's<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.110> hope<00:05:02.230> that's<00:05:02.410> how<00:05:02.590> one

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
time that's the hope that's how one

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
time that's the hope that's how one
evaporator<00:05:03.220> works<00:05:03.820> -<00:05:04.980> so<00:05:05.980> at<00:05:06.100> every<00:05:06.220> step<00:05:06.610> it

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
evaporator works - so at every step it

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.010 
evaporator works - so at every step it
gets<00:05:06.910> better<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.270> better<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:07.540> better<00:05:07.600> yeah

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
gets better and better and better yeah

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.870 
gets better and better and better yeah
and<00:05:08.230> this<00:05:08.320> isn't<00:05:08.530> smoke<00:05:08.950> this<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.370> all<00:05:09.520> steam

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
and this isn't smoke this is all steam

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.270 
and this isn't smoke this is all steam
that's<00:05:10.480> coming<00:05:10.810> off<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:10.960> SAP<00:05:11.320> so<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:11.920> takes<00:05:12.130> a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
that's coming off the SAP so it takes a

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.340 
that's coming off the SAP so it takes a
lot<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.580> fat<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.180> make<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.330> little<00:05:13.600> syrup<00:05:13.960> right

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
lot of fat to make a little syrup right

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.730 
lot of fat to make a little syrup right
it's<00:05:14.650> usually<00:05:14.830> about<00:05:15.220> 40<00:05:16.180> gallons<00:05:16.420> of<00:05:16.810> sap<00:05:17.050> to

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
it's usually about 40 gallons of sap to

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.010 
it's usually about 40 gallons of sap to
one<00:05:18.220> gallon<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.610> syrup<00:05:18.820> sometimes<00:05:19.300> it's<00:05:19.720> 30

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
one gallon of syrup sometimes it's 30

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.110 
one gallon of syrup sometimes it's 30
just<00:05:20.860> depends<00:05:21.250> on<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:21.460> year<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.910> tree

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
just depends on the year and the tree

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.790 
just depends on the year and the tree
that's<00:05:22.900> expensive

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
that's expensive

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.010 
that's expensive
yeah<00:05:24.150> whoa<00:05:25.150> that's<00:05:25.450> hot<00:05:27.480> you<00:05:28.480> can't<00:05:28.750> stay<00:05:28.960> too

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
yeah whoa that's hot you can't stay too

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.810 
yeah whoa that's hot you can't stay too
close<00:05:29.350> to<00:05:29.500> this<00:05:29.620> thing<00:05:29.800> for<00:05:30.040> too<00:05:30.160> long<00:05:30.310> all

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
close to this thing for too long all

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.370 
close to this thing for too long all
right<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.120> let's<00:05:31.300> talk<00:05:31.540> about<00:05:31.600> actually

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
right so let's talk about actually

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.960 
right so let's talk about actually
finishing<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.950> maple<00:05:33.220> syrup<00:05:33.400> we<00:05:33.730> have<00:05:33.940> a

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
finishing the maple syrup we have a

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.540 
finishing the maple syrup we have a
video<00:05:34.330> several<00:05:34.840> videos<00:05:35.260> about<00:05:35.440> making<00:05:36.130> maple

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
video several videos about making maple

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.570 
video several videos about making maple
syrup<00:05:36.880> with<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.240> propane<00:05:38.170> burner<00:05:38.280> watch<00:05:39.280> that

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
syrup with a propane burner watch that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.760 
syrup with a propane burner watch that
video<00:05:39.730> but<00:05:40.600> basically<00:05:40.780> we're<00:05:41.290> gonna<00:05:41.380> bring

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
video but basically we're gonna bring

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.820 
video but basically we're gonna bring
this<00:05:41.950> up<00:05:42.010> to<00:05:42.340> about<00:05:42.660> 215<00:05:43.660> degrees<00:05:43.840> it'll

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
this up to about 215 degrees it'll
