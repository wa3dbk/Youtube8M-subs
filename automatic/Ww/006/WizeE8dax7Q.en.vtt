00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
thought is a bit of a luck one really to

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.089

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
be honest you can see here and donk

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.619 
be honest you can see here and donk
really<00:02:41.640> should<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:41.849> dealing<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.360> don't

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
really should be dealing that I don't

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.660 
really should be dealing that I don't
know<00:02:42.720> why<00:02:42.840> he's<00:02:43.019> checking<00:02:43.530> his<00:02:43.709> run<00:02:43.920> anything

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
know why he's checking his run anything

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.009 
know why he's checking his run anything
like<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.819> she's<00:02:45.269> getting<00:02:45.599> back<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
like that she's getting back there and

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.440 
like that she's getting back there and
who<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.560> clear<00:02:46.769> but<00:02:47.069> he<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:47.519> ends

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
who from that clear but he actually ends

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
up drawing level with us and we go into

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.819 
up drawing level with us and we go into
extra<00:02:50.459> time<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.090> he<00:02:51.599> then<00:02:51.870> decides<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.620> get

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
extra time and he then decides to get

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.220 
extra time and he then decides to get
goal<00:02:53.069> from<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.459> corner<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.110> know

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
goal from a corner and but you know

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.229

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
since the start of extra time I was all

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.240 
since the start of extra time I was all
out<00:02:57.360> attacking<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.410> definitely<00:02:58.620> cost<00:02:59.099> me

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
out attacking and it definitely cost me

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
out attacking and it definitely cost me
this<00:02:59.400> game<00:02:59.610> because<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.720> here<00:03:01.019> he

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
this game because you can see here he

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350 
this game because you can see here he
simply<00:03:01.860> goes<00:03:01.980> over<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> top<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.910> Falcao

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
simply goes over the top and Falcao

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.940 
simply goes over the top and Falcao
scores<00:03:03.660> an<00:03:03.750> absolutely<00:03:04.079> beautiful<00:03:04.290> girl<00:03:04.739> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
scores an absolutely beautiful girl and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
scores an absolutely beautiful girl and
just<00:03:05.030> simply<00:03:06.030> putting<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.420> over<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> keeper

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
just simply putting that over the keeper

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.860 
just simply putting that over the keeper
so<00:03:07.910> unfortunately<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.209> go<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
so unfortunately we do go out of the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.210 
so unfortunately we do go out of the
tournament<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.560> we're<00:03:10.890> not<00:03:10.950> gonna<00:03:11.129> be

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
winning that 6,000 coin prize which is

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.920 
winning that 6,000 coin prize which is
kind<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:14.030> annoying<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.450> thought<00:03:15.629> this<00:03:15.750> team

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
kind of annoying I thought this team

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.720 
kind of annoying I thought this team
deserved<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> winning<00:03:17.340> something<00:03:17.519> like

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
deserved to the winning something like

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.629 
deserved to the winning something like
that<00:03:17.880> but<00:03:18.060> he<00:03:18.120> he<00:03:19.019> was<00:03:19.200> clearly<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.769> bit<00:03:20.489> better

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
that but he he was clearly a bit better

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.670 
that but he he was clearly a bit better
