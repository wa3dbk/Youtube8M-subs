00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello, good morning, my name is Iván Vega and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.830
 I am a portrait photographer and in this video 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.679
 Today I want to talk to you about these 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.670
 puppies that are the triggers 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.670
 remote flash 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.510
 and that only remote triggers 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.779
 as the name indicates they shoot 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.840
 remotely the flash is activated in the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.470
 flash out of the camera when it 's good 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 use them so good always 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.379
 they recommend you when you start in a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.879
 little in the enlightenment that the worst the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 worst unnatural light for a portrait is 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 the frontal then what in all 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.019
 manual sites when you start 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.960
 get started in the world of photography 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.780
 I recommend you is that never 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.649
 shooting a portrait or a photo with the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.300
 flash mounted on top of the camera or 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:05.600
 even the famous pop-up flash they bring 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.060
 all the reflection that arises when 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.690
 we want to take a picture so really 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.720
 this phrase light would be the worst the worst 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.220
 light and they always recommend that light 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 of the flash 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.270
 this is a flash type cobra 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.860
 for always with respect to the subject 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.870
 photographed or whatever 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.870
 Photographing normally a portrait does not 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.120
 for the light entity not frontally as 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.070
 would be in the camera but always as a 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.800
 slightly elevated and at 45 degrees 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.740
 approximately specifically what 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.340
 flash synchronizers because it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.190
 normally make up the issuer is worth 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.020
 it would be this one that is connected to the shoe 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.049
 hot camera 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.939
 and the receiver that is connected is this 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.429
 it ends with everything to the flash also 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.689
 we can not have only one receiver, that is, 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.729
 have mounted two or three sentences for 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.670
 different lights the main light and a 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.380
 fill light for example and we could 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.470
 have as many receivers as 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.190
 flashes we would like to ride on the scene 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.760
 brands of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.330
 of synchronizers as there are many 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.870
 I can not talk about pocket wizard that is 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.659
 the king mark as we say or the one that has 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.849
 more name more prestige then by 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.760
 example well I'm all this was used 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.909
 is that I use is a brand I think 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.690
 is Asian of the web in every 10 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:41.829
 infinity and the version the model then it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:46.329
 Cactus flame version 4 v 4 is a charge 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:50.879
 economic about about 39 dollars I think that 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.879
 is worth the pack of an emitter and a receiver 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.390
 and for the price they have are very very 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.830
 very reliable usually do not usually fail 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.070
 much 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.070
 according to the web it has not been tested but it has 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.220
 a range of about 30 meters or so 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.360
 the issuer that is this is connected to 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.290
 the camera how is it saying 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.610
 and carry a battery inside a watch type 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 clock that can not be accessed 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.470
 and now I'm going to have here to schedule 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.700
 I even think that 16 different channels 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160
 of trigger frequencies per se 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 you had interference at an angle 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.050
 change them the receiver that is this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.790
 here 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.420
 also has the black botó to put 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.460
 the channels works with two batteries 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.590
 triple that is very good because it 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.379
 they can change 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.349
 and well, it carries the connection for the 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.530
 hot shoe flash to connect 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:53.750
 the flash the flash would be connected here and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 here we would connect it we will only connect to 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.150
 a tripod for flash that would already take 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.130
 for your umbrella shoe or for what 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.520
 what we want 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.620
 and so to be able to make the photo with 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.380
 diffusers with what we want you 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.230
 I teach a little how it would work 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.890
 would dock here the flash descend and the 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.600
 flash is very simple these receivers what 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.870
 only that the issuer and the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.900
 receiver is the sender sends an order of 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.350
 shot to the receiver that is a signal 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 electric 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.450
 and that's what the trigger does is 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.060
 activate the flash does not send ttl data that 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.330
 of camera measurements that is for 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.820
 shoot with these gadgets we would have 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.280
 that we program in manual mode the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.740
 flash power 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.389
 and then go to do some shot of 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.850
 test and then it will be running out of 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:55.020
 adjust by the power of the flash or 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:58.830
 by opening the camera and the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.290
 iso you can go adjusting the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.150
 lighting and I think that this brand has 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.370
 a version that is the uve 5 that I think that 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.650
 also the good thing I think how sure 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.690
 it also does that it also sends the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.430
 Measurement information from the camera to 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.500
 flash and that would allow us to 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.070
 example shoot the flash so 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.340
 Automatic for it and I say they are 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.520
 very economical and they never fail to carry 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.500
 his as I told you the dt l but 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.690
 for the price they have sobradamente 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.900
 they fulfill their function what I like the least 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.120
 because in this case, for example, it would be the 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.100
 lid of the battery cover which is very 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.800
 weak is very flimsy everything to me I do not know 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.100
 it has broken but it opens very easily 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.650
 this stage 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:49.160
 and that there must be access to cancer 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.470
 dismantling the emitter that has to be transferred 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.230
 to change it good from a screw and 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.400
 then you have to squeeze the plastic 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.070
 to open it and such 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.080
 that you have to access to change the 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.970
 battery 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.009
 of the clock inside that has already been 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.379
 changed a couple of times just 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.820
 how is it constantly connected 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.800
 by is spent 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.560
 so you know if you liked this 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.210
 video then give it a little hand up 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.450

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.040
 you can subscribe in a little eyelash and 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.860
