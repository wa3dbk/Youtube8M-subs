from there so there's just a little
little<00:05:11.800> bit<00:05:12.010> difference<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.960> would<00:05:13.960> say<00:05:14.110> this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
little bit difference I would say this

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.900 
little bit difference I would say this
leather<00:05:14.620> is<00:05:14.710> very<00:05:14.830> similar<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:17.910> the

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
leather is very similar to the the
