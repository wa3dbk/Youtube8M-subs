00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
 1 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.200
 the big studio rtl 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.380
 ten months jérémy ferrari I see you 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.630
 come with your Bible it starts 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.810
 how did the bible get it started 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.520
 in Asia we learn the sequence enough 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.830
 strong in fact that when it is strong page 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.880
 35 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.650
 pascal to god he speaks to you directly to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.960
 you drive rites all the way 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.270
 along the book is very annoying but 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.520
 it's like that epages 35th 'is talking to you 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.700
 any reader he tells you he is not good 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.840
 that man is alone then created man 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.960
 saw a big one in your opinion and not the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.730
 animals and yes what good the hens the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.610
 komodo monitors all that and then 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.810
 only after wanted to favre good for 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.240
 you ladies to help you remember 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.100
 we would like you to have been created after 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.420
 ports 1 only then after enough 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.430
 quickly it's god you and has it 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.110
 then quickly enough simply 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.189
 in usa theater stories I do not 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.239
 want to do we all know the story 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.829
 we know less about it 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.079
 the story of their childhood at lesinsin and 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.159
 abel while one calls by 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.600
 envy a lot of things had a 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.340
 little bit heard but what I 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.950
 did not know is that after the death of this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.810
 child at christmas they had another after 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.810
 and yes to replace the one who puts 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.329
 unfortunately was dead and then this 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.329
 new child, and they called them 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:33.649
 it's good here and then it's 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.869
 frankly ugly and difficult to 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.590
 pronounce as first name l2 it means 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.229
 just replacing it's nice for the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.799
 range a moment why my name is 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.439
 scene because your brother is dead and 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.759
 that you are only a substitute this says this 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.520
 that is not given enough 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.079
 meaning let's take our children me the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.110
 mine first I called them is in 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.400
 life 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.480
 hold the ark of noah so its wide of 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.880
 he remember you theirs from 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.930
 the story of Noah's Ark I tell you 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.550
 reminds that stealthy never knows 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 you remember a senator who builds 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.420
 an immense ark to save all 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.310
 animals of the planet of the flood inflicted 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.870
 by god I was almost moved in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.040
 reason this story because I love 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.300
 a beautiful year but I swear 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.170
 I had forgotten that she was in the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.370
 bible this so she's lying she's 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.660
 known they made movies 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.370
 independent and toulouse helped it's 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.450
 incredible this story and suddenly 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.950
 when I read them in their entirety 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.350
 and especially at the source 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.360
 I was very surprised by the end of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.830
 this story so maybe it's me 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.120
 who am crazy or uneducated or both 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.100
 but I remember checking something 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.690
 with you ladies and gentlemen we are 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.070
 still all agree that normally 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.140
 the story of Noah's ark 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.600
 it ends when all the animals 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.800
 are saved through this ark this is 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.110
 well the purpose of the aberration I'm not 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.250
 far from there no then you will see 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.020
 we all have a little bit of my shot 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.160
 yes I do not lie to you I show you 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.290
 when we were told this story 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.820
 ladies and gentlemen we stopped there 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.510
 comes very interesting to them 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.580
 listeners we stopped there this is the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 part that will prefer just before 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.700
 young people start to watch in yellow 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.900
 and you'll see why do not have it 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 read the end because she is a lot 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080
 less beautiful and especially much less 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 consistent than the one you know 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.320
 so listen well I start from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.299
 of the release by ge christmas out with his 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.280
 unvarnished girls elephants of his sons 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.019
 and all the wild beasts every 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.760
 cattle every bird every 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.920
 critters that crawl on the ground 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.410
 go out wide it's a species after 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.940
 the other us and so our brigitte 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.370
 hinny 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.370
 biblical to noah built a hotel in 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.370
 god he took from all pure animals and 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.450
 the all birds pure and offer 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.660
 sacrifices on the altar it's true that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.760
 smiles it does not make sense 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.470
 as if a firefighter brave the dangers 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.720
 a 25-storey building in flames 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.160
 to go save a baby at last he 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.570
 ride he catches the baby redescend 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.690
 I can half the cellars it 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.160
 go back and throw it down that actually 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.430
 in three four players attacked on 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 low marc she did launch 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.980
 rivals quickly tyrant Bar 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.880
 grenoble is the last five 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.570
 chapters on which they are all 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.160
 Okay 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.320
 so that's the favorite chapter in 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.670
 part ben because they have 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.350
 also because it's a lot like 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.080
 rules of laws and massacres 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.489
 so this is a chapter that moves well and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.250
 you were totally who can and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.030
 who can not participate in the Mass 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.850
 it's shocking that they had rules 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.900
 to participate in the Mass in time it is 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.820
 to say that it was not called alarm 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.470
 saleh you have that god assembly 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.390
 because it concerned all 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.650
 religions and it is in this chapter that 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.270
 you find all the basic rules 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.640
 of any religious ceremony 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.530
 to see what religion then me 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.850
 I'll tell you something I find at 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.530
 well in a church a synagogue or 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.840
 a mosque to see if it's always necessary 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.940
 this little check before let 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:46.680
