00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
when it's still warm

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.280 
when it's still warm
I'll<00:03:39.129> be<00:03:39.280> able<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.670> separate<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.510> lot<00:03:40.719> easier

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
I'll be able to separate it a lot easier

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.979 
I'll be able to separate it a lot easier
that<00:03:42.099> way<00:03:42.219> I<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.459> just<00:03:42.639> scoop<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.629> out<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:43.810> a

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.460 
get a little closer here all right now
I've<00:04:22.659> divided<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:24.539> amount<00:04:25.539> in<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.840> casserole

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
I've divided the amount in the casserole

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.700 
I've divided the amount in the casserole
into<00:04:27.130> six<00:04:27.610> somewhat<00:04:28.330> equal<00:04:28.810> servings<00:04:29.440> and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
into six somewhat equal servings and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.540 
into six somewhat equal servings and
just<00:04:30.610> separated<00:04:31.389> them<00:04:31.539> with<00:04:32.380> my<00:04:32.590> spatula<00:04:32.979> like

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
just separated them with my spatula like

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.670 
just separated them with my spatula like
that<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.240> now<00:04:35.110> I'm<00:04:35.349> just<00:04:35.530> gonna<00:04:35.740> dip<00:04:36.159> them<00:04:36.460> out

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
that and now I'm just gonna dip them out

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.770 
that and now I'm just gonna dip them out
maybe<00:04:38.680> they'll<00:04:38.800> somewhat<00:04:39.430> stay<00:04:39.760> together<00:04:42.780> and

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
maybe they'll somewhat stay together and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.709 
maybe they'll somewhat stay together and
that<00:04:43.960> one<00:04:44.199> didn't

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
big freezer like these no containers

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.100 
big freezer like these no containers
because<00:07:19.870> once<00:07:20.870> they<00:07:21.230> snap<00:07:22.630> you<00:07:23.630> know<00:07:23.870> that

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
because once they snap you know that

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:42.280 
because once they snap you know that
they're<00:07:25.330> sealed<00:07:39.460> so<00:07:40.460> anyway<00:07:40.760> they've<00:07:41.000> got<00:07:41.290> six

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.290 
they're sealed so anyway they've got six

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.860 
they're sealed so anyway they've got six
