00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
back of the brake linkage where it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.740 
back of the brake linkage where it
connects<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.680> hub<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:35.000> screw<00:00:35.360> needs<00:00:35.570> to

connects to the hub the screw needs to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.050 
connects to the hub the screw needs to
be<00:00:35.900> completely<00:00:36.410> removed<00:00:36.890> then<00:00:37.610> you<00:00:37.730> can<00:00:37.910> just

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
lightly greased my axle so we'll start

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.320 
lightly greased my axle so we'll start
that<00:03:39.550> axle<00:03:40.090> through<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:41.050> wheel<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:42.330> then

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
in that's going to go between the swing

00:03:47.020 --> 00:04:22.879 
in that's going to go between the swing
arm<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.890> brake<00:03:48.130> hub<00:04:21.030> we'll<00:04:22.030> put<00:04:22.270> our

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
arm and the brake hub we'll put our

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.709 
arm and the brake hub we'll put our
on<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.729> then<00:04:26.729> we'll<00:04:26.879> take<00:04:27.180> our

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.589 

little<00:04:30.719> break<00:04:31.139> arm<00:04:31.439> and<00:04:31.800> there<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.879> a<00:04:32.909> timing

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
little break arm and there is a timing

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.939 
little break arm and there is a timing
mark<00:04:33.960> that's<00:04:34.379> on<00:04:35.539> both<00:04:36.539> pieces<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.469> those<00:04:37.680> two

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
mark that's on both pieces so those two

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.540 
mark that's on both pieces so those two
little<00:04:38.129> dots<00:04:38.490> need<00:04:38.939> to<00:04:39.120> line<00:04:39.360> up<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:40.550> dot

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
little dots need to line up the dot

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.980 
little dots need to line up the dot
actually<00:04:41.849> lines<00:04:42.539> up<00:04:42.870> with<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.409> line<00:04:44.990> where

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
actually lines up with the line where

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.640 
actually lines up with the line where
the<00:04:46.020> pinch<00:04:46.439> bolt<00:04:46.770> goes<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.090> with<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.650> with

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
the pinch bolt goes so with that with

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.969 
the pinch bolt goes so with that with
everything<00:04:52.949> loose<00:04:54.229> you<00:04:55.229> want<00:04:55.409> to<00:04:55.560> hook<00:04:55.740> up

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
everything loose you want to hook up

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:09.999 
everything loose you want to hook up
your<00:04:56.009> break<00:04:56.580> arm<00:04:56.909> and<00:04:57.240> your<00:04:57.659> torsion<00:04:58.199> bar<00:05:08.659> and

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009

then<00:05:11.009> once<00:05:11.219> there

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
then once there

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.230 
then once there
things<00:05:11.770> back<00:05:12.040> together<00:05:12.250> then<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:12.910> can<00:05:13.090> begin

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
things back together then you can begin

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.830 
things back together then you can begin
to<00:05:13.450> tighten<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.170> all<00:05:14.320> back<00:05:14.590> down<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:16.600> again

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
to tighten it all back down but again

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.050

leave<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.290> loose<00:05:17.530> until<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.430> get<00:05:18.610> your<00:05:18.760> brake

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
leave it loose until you get your brake

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.930

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
arm on in your torsion bar or to be

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.710 
arm on in your torsion bar or to be
really<00:05:22.240> hard<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.570> get<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:22.930> stuff<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:24.480> line<00:05:25.480> up

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
really hard to get this stuff to line up

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:42.530 
really hard to get this stuff to line up
and<00:05:25.930> go<00:05:26.080> together<00:05:26.230> properly<00:05:27.010> I<00:05:40.710> did<00:05:41.710> find<00:05:42.040> the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
and go together properly I did find the

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.870 
and go together properly I did find the
bolt<00:05:43.540> that<00:05:44.110> came<00:05:44.350> out<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.650> this<00:05:45.010> was<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.520> little

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
bolt that came out of this was a little

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.540 
bolt that came out of this was a little
bit<00:05:46.030> stripped<00:05:46.560> so<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.590> went<00:05:48.100> ahead<00:05:48.160> and<00:05:48.310> I'm

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
bit stripped so I went ahead and I'm

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.290 
bit stripped so I went ahead and I'm
gonna<00:05:48.730> replace<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.570> with<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:52.050> hex<00:05:53.050> head<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
gonna replace it with a hex head and I

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.510 
gonna replace it with a hex head and I
usually<00:05:56.140> keep<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.620> bunch<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.950> these<00:05:57.040> around<00:05:57.340> for

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
usually keep a bunch of these around for

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.110 
usually keep a bunch of these around for
different<00:05:57.790> motorcycles<00:05:59.070> but<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.640> can<00:06:00.820> find

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
different motorcycles but you can find

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.930 
different motorcycles but you can find
this<00:06:01.390> hex<00:06:02.050> head<00:06:02.350> bolt<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.920> loes<00:06:03.190> for<00:06:03.700> about<00:06:03.910> a

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
this hex head bolt that loes for about a

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.090 
this hex head bolt that loes for about a
dollar

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
dollar

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.560 
dollar
it<00:06:06.100> makes<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.520> bike<00:06:06.700> a<00:06:06.850> little<00:06:07.090> bit<00:06:07.390> more

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
it makes the bike a little bit more

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.730 
it makes the bike a little bit more
modern<00:06:08.110> than<00:06:08.730> with<00:06:09.730> the<00:06:10.050> 12<00:06:11.050> millimeter<00:06:11.530> that

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
modern than with the 12 millimeter that

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:22.560 
modern than with the 12 millimeter that
I<00:06:11.800> had<00:06:12.040> pulled<00:06:12.250> out<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.520> there<00:06:21.360> so<00:06:22.360> with
