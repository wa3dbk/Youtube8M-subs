in and of itself and to actually put in
a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.299> bit<00:00:15.420> more<00:00:15.900> time<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.500> make<00:00:16.859> something

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a little bit more time to make something

let's play of the game we've got too

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.460 
let's play of the game we've got too
many<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.080> part<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
many going on and the part of the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.660 
many going on and the part of the
problem<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> course<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.220> game<00:00:26.460> never

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
problem is of course this game never

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
problem is of course this game never
ends<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.359> also<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
ends I also don't think it's that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.769 
ends I also don't think it's that
interesting<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.429> necessarily<00:00:29.849> talk<00:00:30.269> about<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
interesting to necessarily talk about a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
interesting to necessarily talk about a
long<00:00:30.960> term<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.980> here's<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.189> city<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.520> still

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
long term but here's my city is still

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610 
long term but here's my city is still
some<00:00:32.940> areas<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.450> totally<00:00:34.230> totally

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
some areas that are not totally totally

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.660 
some areas that are not totally totally
keen<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.910> overall<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> design<00:00:38.640> i

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
keen on but overall the the design i

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
keen on but overall the the design i
think<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> interesting<00:00:39.629> i'm<00:00:40.200> trying

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
think is kind of interesting i'm trying

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.260 
think is kind of interesting i'm trying
to<00:00:40.890> make<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.670> sort<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> more

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to make all these little sort of more

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.549 
to make all these little sort of more
self-contained<00:00:42.870> neighborhoods<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> i

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
self-contained neighborhoods that i

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
self-contained neighborhoods that i
think<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.860> interesting<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> few

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
think is interesting with just a few

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
think is interesting with just a few
connections<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.660> between<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:47.070> main<00:00:47.250> arteries

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
connections in between the main arteries

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
connections in between the main arteries
of<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.940> city<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> larger<00:00:48.899> avenues<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.789> i

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
of my city are the larger avenues and i

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
of my city are the larger avenues and i
mean<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.239> i<00:00:51.329> zoom<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.690> i'll<00:00:51.960> probably<00:00:52.230> see

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
mean if i zoom in here i'll probably see

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
mean if i zoom in here i'll probably see
a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> traffic<00:00:54.260> but<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> traffic<00:00:55.770> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
a lot of traffic but the traffic is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.580 
a lot of traffic but the traffic is
actually<00:00:56.280> flowing<00:00:56.430> along<00:00:56.730> free<00:00:57.539> well<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.350> only

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
actually flowing along free well i only

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually flowing along free well i only
get<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> occasional<00:00:59.399> complaint<00:00:59.969> usually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
get the occasional complaint usually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
get the occasional complaint usually
it's<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.809> tiny<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.500> street<00:01:02.010> somewhere

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's like a tiny little street somewhere

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.939 
it's like a tiny little street somewhere
that<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.850> flagged<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.510> red<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.350> traffic

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that that's flagged as red for traffic

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
that that's flagged as red for traffic
that's<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.519> too<00:01:05.729> busy<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's just a little too busy it's a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.490 
that's just a little too busy it's a
fire<00:01:06.750> truck

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
fire truck

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.690 
fire truck
I<00:01:08.590> mean<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> truth

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 

is<00:01:16.670> can't<00:01:17.670> seem<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> click<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is can't seem to click on it in that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
content this is actually one of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
content this is actually one of the
first<00:01:29.460> blocks<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.970> did<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.330> not<00:01:30.540> really

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
first blocks I did and I'm not really

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
first blocks I did and I'm not really
happy<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.619> sort<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.970> i'm<00:01:32.970> probably

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910 
happy with this sort of i'm probably
going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> delete<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.680> i'm

office as well i actually just built a
huge<00:01:45.149> high<00:01:45.450> tech<00:01:45.690> industry<00:01:46.200> block<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.549> again

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
huge high tech industry block and again

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.370 
huge high tech industry block and again
i<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.569> oh<00:01:48.750> let's<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.050> lay<00:01:49.289> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
i was just like oh let's just lay it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840 
i was just like oh let's just lay it
down<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.800> we'll<00:01:49.950> we'll<00:01:50.520> figure<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.759> out

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
down then we'll we'll figure it out

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.309 
down then we'll we'll figure it out
later<00:01:50.909> i<00:01:51.240> haven't<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.659> nervous<00:01:52.020> about

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
later i haven't been nervous about

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.749 
later i haven't been nervous about
bulldozing<00:01:53.130> things<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> city

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
bulldozing things in the city

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.510 
bulldozing things in the city
redesigning<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.539> as<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.319> i<00:01:56.190> think<00:01:56.429> it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
redesigning it as i go and i think it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.590 
redesigning it as i go and i think it
makes<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.789> quite<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.149> more<00:01:57.360> interesting

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
makes it quite a bit more interesting

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
makes it quite a bit more interesting
