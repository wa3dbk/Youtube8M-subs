00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.740
 well let's see the gears that are 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.549
 Cog wheels on which each teeth 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.219
 of the drive gear moves a tooth from the 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.199
 gear driven in this case are 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.050
 teeth that must match in size 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.910
 if this wheel has less teeth it has 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.300
 have to do more laps so that you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.419
 wheels take a turn but there is a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 special gear that is the screw 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:33.430
 endlessly the endless screw in this case 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.900
 has a driving wheel that is this and a 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.190
 driven wheel that is always 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.470
 say white moves when it rotates moves 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.410
 to orange but never orange to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.810
 white is also slowed down the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.270
 difference is that when I pass a 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.840
 motor tooth passes a tooth of 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.900
 driven however here is always the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 same tooth 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.950
 an endless tooth hence its name is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 always the same tooth that is 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.700
 turning that is in the endless screw 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 there is a single very long tooth that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.420
 never end an endless tooth that never 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 it ends up that the same tooth is always the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.090
 that is working however here the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.940
 teeth are going from one to another go 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.860
 jumping teeth seen this we are going to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.300
 see how an endless screw works 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.000
 real here we have it 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.130
 this is the motor the worm and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 the cogwheel when I put the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 stack to the engine this turns the white rotates and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.990
 every time he goes around he passes a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.320
 tooth 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.869
 If I give another turn to get teeth if 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.010
 This cog has 50 teeth 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.670
 I have to turn the engine 50 times 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.930
 so he is in a single round because 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.520
 every time you go around the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.820
 endless screw only passes a 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.500
 tooth wheel driven as is the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.960
 mathematical calculation here we have the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.510
 model let's say that the engine is going 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.700
 revolutions per minute this is the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.080
 symbol worm always 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.030
 has a tooth is always the same 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640
 tooth which is working not 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 let's go make the mistake of telling 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.780
 teeth, let's not do one two three 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.850
 four or five is not not not always the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.490
 same tooth that is working is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.950
 a long tooth actually and it's always the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.590
 same tooth is that it is working without 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.960
 But in the cogwheel they go by 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.270
 the teeth of one another and they are going 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.240
 as the sefin screw goes 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.280
 turning in this example the screw without 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.770
 end has zetas that represent the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.290
 teeth a tooth and the cogwheel 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 has a zeta that represents its 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.020
 teeth of 50 teeth the ratio of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.390
 transmission is always the number of 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
 motor teeth divided by the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.160
 number of teeth of the driven 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.410
 the number of people on the motor is always 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.060
 one always on all the screws in 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.280
 end the number of motor teeth 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.630
 always 1 and the number of teeth of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.270
 driven then it depends on the rue de 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.319
 appointments you have this has 50 teeth and 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.510
 this one has 30 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.079
 in this case it's a match for 50 that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.390
 means done that the cogwheel more 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.630
 50 times slower than the engine 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.150
 50 times slower let's see it in the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.610
 mathematical formula says that all all 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.770
 the gears your form the math is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.920
 that the number of revolutions per minute 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 of the motor for the number of teeth of the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.400
 motor is equal to the number of 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 revolutions per minute of the driven 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.700
 by the number of teeth of the driven 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.650
 If I have the number of 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.340
 revolutions per minute of the motor are 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.900
 my revolutions that has a tooth 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.370
 I want to calculate how many revolutions 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.900
 rotate at what speed the driven one rotates 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.560
 knowing his teeth that are 50 cleared 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.980
 the equis thousand for 1 between 50 is in this 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.190
 50 I've been dividing it here 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.390
 thousand for one between 50 and 20 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.640
 effectively if I plugged in this engine 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.340
 if the engine turns at a thousand revolutions per 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.500
 this minute will turn 50 times more 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.790
 slow at 20 revolutions per minute 50 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.200
 times slower than was the relationship of 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.200
 transmission that we had calculated before
