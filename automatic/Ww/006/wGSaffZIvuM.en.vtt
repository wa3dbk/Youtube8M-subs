00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is that hey wait a second it's the only

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
is that hey wait a second it's the only
thing<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.260> bucket<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.460> pretty

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
thing is it's this bucket that's pretty

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
thing is it's this bucket that's pretty
bad<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:12.659> bad<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.950> soon<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
bad it's bad because as soon as you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.859 
bad it's bad because as soon as you
start<00:01:14.850> using<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> couple<00:01:15.900> seconds<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
start using it for a couple seconds it

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.969 
start using it for a couple seconds it
starts<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.409> falls<00:01:19.710> apart<00:01:20.630> like<00:01:21.630> mine<00:01:22.350> already

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
starts it falls apart like mine already

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.800 
starts it falls apart like mine already
fell<00:01:23.520> apart<00:01:24.680> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:29.390> what<00:01:30.390> little

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
fell apart if you can see what little

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.730 
fell apart if you can see what little
part<00:01:31.049> chipped<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.280> might<00:01:32.640> fall<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
part chipped off so that might fall and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.990 
part chipped off so that might fall and
this<00:01:34.740> thing<00:01:35.009> comes<00:01:35.340> off<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.759> quickly<00:01:36.710> so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.850 

I'm<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.960> bad<00:01:43.409> review

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
I'm not going to put a very bad review

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
I'm not going to put a very bad review
because<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.939> part<00:01:45.210> she'll<00:01:46.170> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
because it's just this part she'll be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.749 
because it's just this part she'll be
able<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.890> fix<00:01:47.189> pretty<00:01:47.670> easily<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:52.700> hey<00:01:53.700> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
able to fix pretty easily but hey you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.109 
able to fix pretty easily but hey you
can<00:01:54.000> fix<00:01:54.030> us<00:01:54.479> pretty<00:01:54.720> easy

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.609 

but<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.899> can't<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.259> move<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
but it like you can't really move the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.919 
but it like you can't really move the
bucket<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.310> good<00:02:03.470> but<00:02:05.479> surely<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
bucket that good but surely it in a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:21.740 
bucket that good but surely it in a
bucket

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.970 

um<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:26.980> model<00:02:27.459> itself<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
um what now the model itself the the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.119 
um what now the model itself the the
outriggers<00:02:30.640> go<00:02:30.910> out<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.989> way<00:02:32.140> they<00:02:32.950> go

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
outriggers go out all the way they go

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.229 
outriggers go out all the way they go
down<00:02:33.340> really<00:02:34.120> far<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.310> lifts<00:02:36.760> left<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
down really far so it lifts left the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:45.559 
down really far so it lifts left the
tires<00:02:37.540> pretty<00:02:38.230> good<00:02:39.569> listen<00:02:40.569> about<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:43.530> about

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
tires pretty good listen about up about

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.610 
tires pretty good listen about up about
probably<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.870> centimeter<00:02:47.670> at<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.910> most<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
probably a centimeter at the most and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.789 
probably a centimeter at the most and
then<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.250> part<00:02:51.700> makes<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.799> or<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.560> is

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
then this part makes it or so this is

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.800 
then this part makes it or so this is
pretty<00:02:57.069> good<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> lot<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.810> diecast<00:02:59.500> metal

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
pretty good a lot of it is diecast metal

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.860 
pretty good a lot of it is diecast metal
