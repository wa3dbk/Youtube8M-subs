this<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.340> my<00:00:02.870> 45,000<00:00:03.870> watt<00:00:04.640> diesel<00:00:05.640> generator

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.730 

it<00:00:10.050> was<00:00:10.170> complete<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.389> John<00:00:12.389> Deere<00:00:12.900> diesel

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
it was complete with a John Deere diesel

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.820 
it was complete with a John Deere diesel
engine<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> turbocharger<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
engine with a turbocharger and the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.730 
engine with a turbocharger and the
generator<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:21.080> will<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.170> our<00:00:22.350> control<00:00:22.650> panel

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
generator that will be our control panel

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.269 
generator that will be our control panel
this<00:00:26.510> side<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> engine<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.710> can't<00:00:29.039> see

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this side of the engine you can't see

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:42.639 
this side of the engine you can't see
because<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.699> dark<00:00:33.079> some<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> connectors

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.590 

give<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> start<00:00:45.680> first<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.190> turn<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
give it a start first we can turn the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
give it a start first we can turn the
battery<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.629> will<00:00:52.160> go<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.270> here<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
battery on and we will go to here and we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
battery on and we will go to here and we
will<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.230> manual<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:56.129> won't<00:00:56.370> make

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
will put it in manual which won't make

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.729 
will put it in manual which won't make
it<00:00:56.640> start

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:23.440 

and<00:01:03.829> is<00:01:03.950> currently<00:01:04.280> on<00:01:04.489> low<00:01:04.820> idle

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.800 

it<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> relatively<00:01:25.140> quiet

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.960 

when<00:01:30.290> I'll<00:01:30.470> turn<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.520> generate<00:01:32.299> power

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
when I'll turn it to generate power

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:51.450 
when I'll turn it to generate power
thousands

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:02.270 

there<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.180> have

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.550 

so<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.000> still<00:02:03.240> talk<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.560> it's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
so you can still talk over it and it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.589 
so you can still talk over it and it's
not

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.819 

so<00:02:13.109> you<00:02:13.260> all<00:02:13.439> eventually<00:02:15.349> take<00:02:16.349> down<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
so you all eventually take down that

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.309 
so you all eventually take down that
little<00:02:17.430> shed<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.150> probably<00:02:18.900> stick<00:02:19.139> it<00:02:19.260> right

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
little shed and probably stick it right

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.640 
little shed and probably stick it right
there<00:02:19.469> not<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.519> trailer<00:02:21.139> we<00:02:22.139> may<00:02:22.290> make<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
there not on the trailer we may make it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.989 
there not on the trailer we may make it
temporary<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.099> permanent<00:02:23.249> I<00:02:23.519> haven't<00:02:23.790> decided

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
temporary or permanent I haven't decided

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.180 
temporary or permanent I haven't decided
yet
