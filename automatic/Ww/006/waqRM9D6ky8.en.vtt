00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
are the defenders in the goalkeeper but

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.839 
are the defenders in the goalkeeper but
I<00:00:25.380> am<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.560> sure<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.580> team<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I am pretty sure this is how the team is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
I am pretty sure this is how the team is
gonna<00:00:27.180> pan<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.560> just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
gonna pan out not because I just

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.259 
gonna pan out not because I just
guessing<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.340> feel<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.820> gonna<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
guessing I feel like it's gonna be that

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.550 
guessing I feel like it's gonna be that
way<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.439> if

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
way but because I think that if

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
way but because I think that if
mirroring<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> world<00:00:33.300> 11<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.840> announced

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
mirroring the world 11 I was announced

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
mirroring the world 11 I was announced
on<00:00:34.500> Endor<00:00:35.190> thief<00:00:35.399> rewards<00:00:35.850> which<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> believe

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
on Endor thief rewards which I believe

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.069 
on Endor thief rewards which I believe
was<00:00:36.719> yesterday<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> team<00:00:39.079> some

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
was yesterday and this is a team some

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.680 
was yesterday and this is a team some
players<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> position<00:00:41.329> which<00:00:42.329> doesn't

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
players out of position which doesn't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.200 
players out of position which doesn't
really<00:00:42.809> make<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> compatible<00:00:43.610> compatible<00:00:44.610> with

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
really make a compatible compatible with

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
really make a compatible compatible with
the<00:00:45.239> FIFA<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.079> i'm<00:00:46.170> pretty<00:00:46.379> sure<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the FIFA but i'm pretty sure that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
the FIFA but i'm pretty sure that
they'll<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.100> position<00:00:47.520> specific<00:00:47.910> cards<00:00:48.300> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
they'll have position specific cards for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
they'll have position specific cards for
example<00:00:48.840> you'll<00:00:48.960> find<00:00:49.200> file<00:00:49.440> car<00:00:49.680> maybe<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
example you'll find file car maybe as a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
example you'll find file car maybe as a
right<00:00:50.430> forward<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.210> wing<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
right forward or a right wing and you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.490 
right forward or a right wing and you
might<00:00:52.559> find<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.949> esta<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:54.300> center<00:00:55.079> midfield

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
might find any esta as a center midfield

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
might find any esta as a center midfield
so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.660> any<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.350> them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
so you don't know i think any of them

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.670 
so you don't know i think any of them
better<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> center<00:00:59.370> midfield<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.359> um<00:01:00.680> yeah

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
better as a center midfield but um yeah

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
better as a center midfield but um yeah
I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:01.890> that's<00:01:02.219> better<00:01:02.489> positions<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.390> them

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I think that's better positions for them

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
I think that's better positions for them
anyway<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> talk<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> through

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
club that is because Falcao who plays

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550 
club that is because Falcao who plays
for<00:01:38.130> Atletico<00:01:38.670> whereas<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> rest<00:01:40.350> played

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
for FC Barcelona or Real Madrid so the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.539 
for FC Barcelona or Real Madrid so the
defense<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.640> half<00:01:45.540> Spanish<00:01:45.899> hot<00:01:46.049> brazilian

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
defense is half Spanish hot brazilian

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
defense is half Spanish hot brazilian
and<00:01:47.549> Ramos<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> centre-back<00:01:49.079> PK

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and Ramos is a centre-back PK

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
and Ramos is a centre-back PK
centre-back<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> good<00:01:51.270> overall<00:01:51.810> stats<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
centre-back good a good overall stats I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.630 
centre-back good a good overall stats I
think<00:01:52.439> ramelteon<00:01:52.740> still<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.399> better

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
think ramelteon still a little better
