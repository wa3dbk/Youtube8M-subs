00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050 
interesting is that apparently this will
be<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> dual<00:01:39.869> sim<00:01:40.200> phone<00:01:40.280> which<00:01:41.280> doesn't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
be a dual sim phone which doesn't

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
be a dual sim phone which doesn't
necessarily<00:01:42.659> mean<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.470> because

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
necessarily mean a good thing because

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.740 
necessarily mean a good thing because
this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> popular<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.490> emerging<00:01:45.030> markets<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this is popular in emerging markets and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
this is popular in emerging markets and
in<00:01:46.259> Asia<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.250> United<00:01:47.610> States<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in Asia but not of the United States so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
in Asia but not of the United States so
let's<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.290> how<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.560> goes<00:01:49.590> hopefully<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
let's see how that goes hopefully it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.969 
let's see how that goes hopefully it
won't<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.729> Asia<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.899> phone<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.829> let's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
won't be a Asia only phone now let's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
won't be a Asia only phone now let's
talk<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.159> Samsung<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.909> we've<00:01:54.060> always

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
talk about Samsung is we've always

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
talk about Samsung is we've always
praised<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> company<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.500> their<00:01:55.590> marketing

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of Galaxy devices and that is just about

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
of Galaxy devices and that is just about
to<00:01:58.530> end<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:59.070> talked<00:01:59.399> last<00:01:59.520> week<00:01:59.820> about<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to end we talked last week about the

curved display but some interesting

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.920 
reports from some trusted sources
apparently<00:02:40.030> linked<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> fact<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
apparently linked to the fact that the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.899 
apparently linked to the fact that the
company<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.349> not<00:02:41.620> planning<00:02:42.159> on<00:02:42.280> launching<00:02:42.519> a

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
company is not planning on launching a

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.599 
company is not planning on launching a
curve<00:02:43.209> display<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.900> galaxy<00:02:44.560> s<00:02:44.769> apparently

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
curve display on the galaxy s apparently

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.250 
curve display on the galaxy s apparently
they're<00:02:45.760> planning<00:02:46.359> on<00:02:46.510> making<00:02:46.780> something

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
they're planning on making something

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.410 
they're planning on making something
more<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:48.069> note<00:02:48.220> 3<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:49.090> seems<00:02:49.329> that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
more like the note 3 and it seems that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.149 
more like the note 3 and it seems that
the<00:02:49.569> curve<00:02:49.810> design<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.290> going<00:02:50.409> to<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.590> left<00:02:50.859> for

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
the curve design is going to be left for

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.949 
the curve design is going to be left for
the<00:02:51.220> end<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.879> year<00:02:52.180> which<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.750> time

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the end of the year which is the time

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.660 
the end of the year which is the time
when<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.170> note<00:02:53.349> 4<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.889> going<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.099> be<00:02:54.220> launched

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
when the note 4 is going to be launched

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.759 
when the note 4 is going to be launched
so<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:55.060> seems<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.780> note<00:02:56.019> 4<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.500> gonna<00:02:56.650> be

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
so it seems that the note 4 is gonna be

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.349 
so it seems that the note 4 is gonna be
the<00:02:56.889> next<00:02:57.010> foe<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.639> curve<00:02:57.879> display<00:02:58.299> so

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
the next foe with a curve display so

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.360 
the next foe with a curve display so
let's<00:02:59.109> hope<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.439> get<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.739> one<00:02:59.950> right<00:03:00.129> but

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
let's hope they get this one right but

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.649 
let's hope they get this one right but
anyways<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:01.060> makes<00:03:01.239> me<00:03:01.299> see<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> question

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
anyways that makes me see the question

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.080 
anyways that makes me see the question
of<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> day<00:03:01.989> how<00:03:02.519> important<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.700> curb

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
of the day how important is a curb

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.210 
of the day how important is a curb
