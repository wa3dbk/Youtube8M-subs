on our decorative floors or walls for
that<00:00:17.699> matter<00:00:17.940> we'll<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> tool<00:00:19.170> that's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that matter we'll use this tool that's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.580 
that matter we'll use this tool that's
called<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.939> HVLP<00:00:20.939> high<00:00:21.420> volume<00:00:21.930> low<00:00:22.080> pressure

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
called a HVLP high volume low pressure

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.830 
called a HVLP high volume low pressure
sprayer<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> means<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.390> simply

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
sprayer and what that means is simply

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120 
sprayer and what that means is simply
you<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> large<00:00:25.500> volume<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.010> material

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you have a large volume of material

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
you have a large volume of material
that's<00:00:26.609> coming<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> tip<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.199> you're

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that's coming out of the tip but you're

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
that's coming out of the tip but you're
spraying<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.279> low<00:00:29.460> pressure<00:00:29.760> now<00:00:30.330> why

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
spraying at a very low pressure now why

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
spraying at a very low pressure now why
is<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.779> important<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.130> spray<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.460> too

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is that important if you spray it too

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.160 
is that important if you spray it too
high<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> pressure<00:00:33.420> especially<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.020> you're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
high of a pressure especially if you're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990 
high of a pressure especially if you're
working<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.860> finished<00:00:35.190> environment<00:00:35.730> inside

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
working in a finished environment inside

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
working in a finished environment inside
somebody's<00:00:36.360> home<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.020> example<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.829> can't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
somebody's home for example you can't

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000 
somebody's home for example you can't
have<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> lot<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> airborne<00:00:39.360> dust<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
have a lot of airborne dust going it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
have a lot of airborne dust going it
could<00:00:41.070> contaminate<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> cabinets<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.719> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
could contaminate all the cabinets so we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
could contaminate all the cabinets so we
try<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> spray<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.559> low<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.890> possible<00:00:43.950> now

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
try to spray as low as possible now

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
try to spray as low as possible now
typically<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.570> somewhere<00:00:45.899> around<00:00:46.050> 10

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
typically that's somewhere around 10

pounds pressure depending on the type of
material<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.469> using<00:00:49.710> I'll<00:00:50.100> spray

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
material that you're using I'll spray

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.930 
material that you're using I'll spray
water-based<00:00:51.210> stains<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.460> water-based<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
water-based stains and water-based and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.900 
water-based stains and water-based and
solvent<00:00:54.570> based<00:00:54.750> dies<00:00:55.489> typically<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> won't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
solvent based dies typically I won't

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
solvent based dies typically I won't
spray<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.390> acid<00:00:57.750> stain<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.260> through<00:00:58.620> here

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
spray an acid stain here through here

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
spray an acid stain here through here
because<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> don't<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> acid<00:00:59.760> stain<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
because I don't want the acid stain to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.830 
because I don't want the acid stain to
corrode<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.320> metal<00:01:02.250> components<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> way

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
corrode the metal components now the way

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
corrode the metal components now the way
that<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.260> gun<00:01:04.530> works<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.189> basically<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that this gun works is basically you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.060 
that this gun works is basically you
have<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.540> air<00:01:06.780> feed<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> connect<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.770> air

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have an air feed you connect your air

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
have an air feed you connect your air
feed<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
feed right here and then you have a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
feed right here and then you have a
trigger<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.189> you've<00:01:11.430> ever<00:01:11.610> watched<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
trigger now if you've ever watched a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
trigger now if you've ever watched a
good<00:01:12.330> airbrush<00:01:12.780> artist<00:01:13.049> whether<00:01:13.770> they're

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
good airbrush artist whether they're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
good airbrush artist whether they're
painting<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.460> high<00:01:14.880> end<00:01:15.060> car<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> motorcycle

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
painting a high end car or a motorcycle

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
painting a high end car or a motorcycle
tank<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.650> example<00:01:17.070> they'll<00:01:17.430> always<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
tank for example they'll always have the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
tank for example they'll always have the
air<00:01:18.270> pressure<00:01:18.540> spring<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.890> what

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
air pressure spring and then what

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
air pressure spring and then what
they'll<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> they'll<00:01:20.670> gently<00:01:21.270> spray<00:01:21.630> back

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
they'll do is they'll gently spray back

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.830 
they'll do is they'll gently spray back
or<00:01:22.350> pull<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.390> releases

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
or pull back and that's what releases

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
or pull back and that's what releases
the<00:01:24.960> material<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.500> you've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.340> your

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the material out you've got your

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
the material out you've got your
pressure<00:01:26.850> valve<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
pressure valve here that's going to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
pressure valve here that's going to
dictate<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.180> pressure<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.720> spray<00:01:30.990> with

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
dictate how much pressure you spray with

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340 
dictate how much pressure you spray with
and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.520> you've<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.350> spray

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and then back here you've got the spray

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
and then back here you've got the spray
pattern<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.610> adjust<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.180> clockwise<00:01:36.540> all

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
pattern so if I adjust it clockwise all

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
pattern so if I adjust it clockwise all
the<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> spray<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.610> conical

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the way it's going to spray in a conical

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
the way it's going to spray in a conical
fashion<00:01:39.509> whereas<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.650> counterclockwise

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
fashion whereas if I go counterclockwise

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
fashion whereas if I go counterclockwise
it's<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> spray<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> fan<00:01:42.659> pattern

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it's going to spray in a fan pattern

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.149 
it's going to spray in a fan pattern
this<00:01:43.920> device<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.149> simply<00:01:46.159> determines

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this device right here simply determines

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 
this device right here simply determines
how<00:01:47.369> far<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> squeeze<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
how far back you're going to squeeze the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.770 
how far back you're going to squeeze the
trigger<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> regulates<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.780> it's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
trigger so this regulates that it's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350 
trigger so this regulates that it's
threaded<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> comes<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
threaded on so when it comes time to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
threaded on so when it comes time to
