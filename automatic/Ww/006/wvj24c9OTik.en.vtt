00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.310
 in another video tutorial we explain 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.250
 how to use the lines are manipulated in the technical drawing 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.669
 now let's see an example 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.820
 one piece 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.460
 It is a cube 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.269
 and that has a draft 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.099
 a drill through 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.949
 then represent it here we can see the piece represented in that I type 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:30.659
 here 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.900
 each piece 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.070
 let's start drawing the tracks of the piece 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.219
 the first 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.740
 know what 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.200
 the edges this 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 they will see to present themselves online it is not 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 p 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130
 in section 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.130
 we have here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.080
 we have represented the edges seen in northwest line 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 in the left profile 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 we have 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.670
 the edges are also represented 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.600
 n in the Huesca 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.160
 we have here 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.600
 been soloists in this one and be here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 which also has a correct line because they are an exception 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.650
 of the piece to be eaten later a piece was made here to see 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.660
 these two edges 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.480
 and then the plant 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.900
 the plant as we select nothing simply looks 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.140
 the contrast edge of the outline that is a rectangle what you saw from 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.900
 up in the piece 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.070
 that is, if we place ourselves up here 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.110
 we read 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.110
 this time either 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.860
 now 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.520
 we have represented 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 the drill that is through 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 in the plant 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 I do not represent the drill 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.979
 online 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.849
 China 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.849
 There are those who ran over girl 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:27.739
 China 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.709
 the edges or with hidden tournaments in this case is an outline because there is no 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.119
 a sight 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.510
 I remember a list is the intersection of two 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.660
 surfaces such as taring is a single surface we are representing a 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.229
 contour 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.549
 the outline that was seen from the piece's aspirates 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.059
 the control would be seen from here and if we had an edition 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.069
 war and that is that we could see through the piece we would see this point 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.099
 that we have represented online china 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.889
 discontinuous 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
 the final idea is point 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.909
 cessation 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.760
 the cessation of the piece of symmetry power revolution of the drill 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:37.059
 cd he represents fine line back and point here we have them represent 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.559
 to be better statesman must 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.999
 East 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.929
 neither online 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 so as not to finish the angels 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.879
 normally local at the point ends at the final line eta 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.999
 on the point 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 While 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:07.059
 we also remember that trajectories are also represented with fine line 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.429
 back and point 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.069
 here the trajectory 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
 the trajectory 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.479
 i 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.509
 is where to cut in one piece and what will allow me to see 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.210
 the sectioned piece 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.740
 here we have the sectioned piece 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.879
 and it is indicated 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.389
 with the letters tiie 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.509
 is the trajectory 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.509
 one behind the trajectory of nÃ­jar 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.110
 the striped 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.949
 that is, when we cut the piece the new surfaces that are generated 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.689
 must fail 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.180
 that's why cut surfaces 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.210
 not so much these surfaces here 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.009
 CD 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.009
 grating with fine line continues 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.110
 now to dimension the pieces 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.759
 to put the measurement of the piece we will need a reference line 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.759
 The feve reference line are continuous fine lines 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.889
 here we do it 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.110
 drawn 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.539
 and we also see 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.699
 we'll see what we can indicate lucifer as reference lines 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.210
 axes 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.249
 symmetry pose voices of revolution 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.759
 I will be here 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.539
 this axis 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.960
 we will use it 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.509
 support on him 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.509
 the lines of elevation 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.930
 and to 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.430
 Finalize 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.699
 we have drawn the coastline that is also drawn 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.520
 on line without to continue and on them we will put the measurement of the piece by 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
 good example 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.539
 5 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.539
 whatever the measures affect the piece 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.900
 here we will start 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.900
 the depth while the set of goods 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.240
 and this depth will be 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.960
 followed the track from above this company shortened us 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.779
 this view 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.400
 who this time well 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.229
 we started the piece from above, they forgive me the left profile 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.930
 will be this measure therefore here we do not put the coastline 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.759
 because it would be 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.189
 from 10 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.460
 is 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.889
 it's the same 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.360
 this measure 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.770
 and well, everything I hope to see 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.270
 given a small example on which rotated standardized theory illustrated 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.270
 that no longer in him 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:09.879
 tutorial 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.960
 costoya 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.860
 and after the story 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.680
 the presentation
