00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 pinching 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.020

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.020
 string and fourth string 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:05.680
 and here the intro is played so twins 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.670
 I clamp the second string on the third fret 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 this one 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.680
 the verse goes on 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.940
 Spring 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660
 what 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.470
 means the first first chord of us 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.460
 keep losing that is after 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460
 intro you play 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.840
 and drove after this last you 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.910
 let go of your little finger and tight gives out 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.370
 the chord is played like this 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.470
 very simple such you pinch over 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.570
 first in the first fret clamp the first and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.000
 the second side and the second fret 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 pinch the third string with your middle finger 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 next chord c 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 chord will collect as follows you 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.280
 clamp on the first fret the second string 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.350
 on the 2 fret clamp the fourth string 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 middle finger and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.400
 on 5 on 3 fret, you pinch the fifth string 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.790
 you can take a chord more correctly 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.040
 that is, you can hold it even if 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.170
 ring finger can hold the sixth 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 side of the little finger hold down 5 but this is not 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.260
 basically you can play 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 first time showed dense 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.440
 oars 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.630
 not cucumbers and the last one in this box 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.400
 apartment will play as follows in 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.069
 first fret you pinch the third string 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.220
 in the second fret you pinch the fourth and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.220
 fifth 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.090
 the next square of the couplet 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800
 go 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.530
 bars are played chord f he is a master 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.530
 to be taken not as boreal 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.330
 but I will show you the principle of action now 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.010
 in general in the first fret 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.630
 you can either hold a pointer to a pair 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.540
 totally sister on either 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.950
 hold down if you just get the name 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.170
 little knack there is no 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.700
 professionalism is not necessary but in 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.940
 first fret you pinch the first and second 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.330
 the side 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.330
 second mode you have a third country and and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.400
 the third fret is 4 and 5 that is 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:06.220
 mezina 4 untitled 5 can clamp 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:10.430
 to understand I will not take distinguished what 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.580
 there will be d m and playing as follows 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.250
 in the first way in clamping the first string 2 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.290
 fret you clamp the third string 3 frets 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.290
 clamping the second string 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:31.060
 what you 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.480
 datacore I think this is the most cunning 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.510
 the song 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 the most difficult to take it by the way is not difficult 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.620
 Now I will explain how if you already know how 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.700
 play the guitar and know some 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.860
 main chords have such a chord 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.900
 called v.d. 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.590
 where are you the same as yes only on 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.000
 one string higher and if you slept three 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.100
 finger then in this chord you will have 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.010
 use also the little finger and insert 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.360
 its him on the second string 3 frets 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.939
 Well, in order means after the chord dm. 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.469
 leave choose fingers and middle finger 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.129
 so it will be easier to play this song 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:10.090
 leave on the third string 2 frets here 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:13.199
 here you hold the index finger 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.189
 on the fifth string 2 lived up too 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.639
 carry the ring finger on 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:20.949
 fourth string 3 frets have already turned out 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:27.669
 I donâ€™t have this before 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:30.659
 and little finger you clamp on the third fret 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.659
 second string 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:41.840
 there you carry ahead and again 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.830
 all the years we have chorus played very 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.700
 he just consists of chords which he 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:58.700
 already showed a md n and e 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.700
 all vectors will snow with rain that gift 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.880
 na'vi again I 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.880
 I can't see where 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.160
