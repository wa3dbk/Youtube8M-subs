00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.940
 hey main are how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.740
 a new video in this video les 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.870
 I will show how you can install maps of 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.730
 minecraft pocket edition and good what 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.410
 first you need to have is any 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.169
 of those three programs can be iphone 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.540
 box itunes or explorer actually the most 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.390
 popular now is to explorer but I for 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.710
 I usually use itunes then after 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.690
 that they have any of these three 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.850
 what we will do is go to the internet and 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.740
 download any map in the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.420
 description of the video I'll leave you some 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.700
 pages so you can download them though 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.039
 the most famous is minecraft forms point 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.019
 net I've got other pages that 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.519
 they are very very good then we are here 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.949
 and we give in download not really 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:43.800
 matter they will always send us to mediafire 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.800
 grup box I guess then we wait 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 whatever 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 Well, well, we are already 540 and I think we are 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.040
 on channel 547 I'm very happy for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.190
 that, but good, let's stop talking about 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.940
 that and let's continue with the tutorial 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.739
 after this what we will do is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.900
 download what I just do not understand by 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 what is so slow that it throws me so many 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 I guess it was like 15 fps I do not know 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 too much too slow so like 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.290
 can see now he launches me the download and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.170
 mediafire we click there 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.390
 and will launch us mediafire we hope that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 enter to mediafire andrús box in reality 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.630
 they do not have it 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.860
 At this moment what you can see is that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.870
 the files that tell me that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.510
 We unload the ones we download 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.770
 they are points that are compressed in 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.290
 this video will also show you how 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.690
 can decompress them normally with 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.270
 he and he should download this map 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.420
 it weighs something but it is not so much reality but 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.759
 a little more serious others 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.720
 and we hope you download it will be 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.720
 fast download 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.130
 changing I understand why fuck no 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 it starts starts already loaded myers fast 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.940
 it was then after this what 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.510
 will do is be here control jotas and is 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 in chrome and they will show you in folder 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.230
 It usually shows it to us 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.560
 downloads then give in show in 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.080
 folder we can close as I do not know 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 are using to download the maps and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 then you can see that here we have 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.080
 this but bring us this little zipper 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.820
 here showing us that it is compressed 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 so what do we do to decompress 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.490
 we double- click it and after that what 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.200
 what we have to do is drag this 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.660
 to the very very easy desktop 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.870
 unzip a file here I already have 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.520
 one compressed but it would do better that way and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.090
 ready we have the file 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.010
 decompressed and very important mainer 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.440
 inside this folder what you have to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.970
 have these files also has 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.070
 that being songs that is the most important 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.630
 of mainer is this can not be missing since 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.480
 is the one that weighs 21 mb 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.920
 this entity of nothing these are 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.970
 important but not as many as this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.940
 then if you do not have this 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.470
 definitely the map will not work or 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.570
 that after this what we have to 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.460
 to do is enter itunes iphone box or 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.230
 explorer or do not know what they are using to 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.000
 see your files will enter and will be 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.850
 applications after this will search 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 Minecraft 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.720
 although minecraft and give him in brouzés 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 all the same marines is simply a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.570
 different view and as follows and what 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.070
 we will now tell us to documents game 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.010
 mobile computing jiang home mobile point 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.960
 yang minecraft words and after this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.270
 what we have to do is not wait 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.520
 that you experience is simply going to 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.570

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.640
 easy 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.320
 we can open the desk and here 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.240
 we have the maps that we have attached 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.430
 there although we can move to folders 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.590
 as I have at that moment but the bla 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.340
 blah we look for and here is the file 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.410
 example of the match we drag 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.780

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.670
 he is going to copy it 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.830
