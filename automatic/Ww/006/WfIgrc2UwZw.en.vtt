stacking those bleeds he's up to like 10
stacks<00:02:05.390> right<00:02:05.750> now<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.880> that's<00:02:07.880> pretty<00:02:08.269> much

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
stacks right now and that's pretty much

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.999 
stacks right now and that's pretty much
the<00:02:08.450> whole<00:02:08.629> goal<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.080> what<00:02:09.500> he's<00:02:09.679> doing<00:02:09.979> right

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
now throwing up vulnerabilities throwing

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.520 
now throwing up vulnerabilities throwing
out<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> few<00:02:12.590> extra<00:02:12.879> hits<00:02:13.879> here<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.480> there<00:02:14.659> but

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
out a few extra hits here and there but

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.070 
out a few extra hits here and there but
his<00:02:15.830> spec<00:02:16.250> revolves<00:02:17.000> around<00:02:17.120> getting<00:02:17.690> bleeds

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
his spec revolves around getting bleeds

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.309 
his spec revolves around getting bleeds
out<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.040> what<00:02:19.310> he's<00:02:19.550> doing

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
out and that is what he's doing

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.940 
out and that is what he's doing
and<00:02:21.310> uh<00:02:21.489> not<00:02:22.480> too<00:02:22.749> much<00:02:22.930> support<00:02:23.379> for<00:02:23.530> his<00:02:23.650> team

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
and uh not too much support for his team

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.220 
and uh not too much support for his team
unless<00:02:24.159> he's<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.609> a<00:02:24.700> sword<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.150> shield<00:02:25.450> but

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
unless he's in a sword and shield but

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.229 
unless he's in a sword and shield but
again<00:02:26.349> it's<00:02:26.889> something<00:02:27.310> different<00:02:27.819> for<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
again it's something different for the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.300 
again it's something different for the
damage<00:02:28.659> spec<00:02:29.049> warriors<00:02:29.590> other<00:02:29.889> than<00:02:30.159> that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
damage spec warriors other than that

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.360 
damage spec warriors other than that
hundred<00:02:30.700> blades<00:02:30.999> which<00:02:31.359> is<00:02:32.349> really<00:02:33.010> annoying

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
hundred blades which is really annoying

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 
hundred blades which is really annoying
if<00:02:33.639> you're<00:02:33.790> playing<00:02:34.090> against<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.689> but<00:02:35.049> then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
if you're playing against it but then

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
if you're playing against it but then
again<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.769> really<00:02:36.340> boring<00:02:36.579> expect<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.299> watch

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
again is really boring expect to watch

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.110 
again is really boring expect to watch
and<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.109> see<00:02:38.349> he<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:38.829> used<00:02:39.430> his<00:02:39.700> sword<00:02:39.969> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and you see he just used his sword and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.119 
and you see he just used his sword and
shield<00:02:40.329> there<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.689> do<00:02:40.840> some<00:02:41.079> extra<00:02:41.349> damage<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
shield there to do some extra damage and

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.129 
shield there to do some extra damage and
get<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:43.030> guy<00:02:43.239> knocked<00:02:43.510> down<00:02:43.689> get<00:02:43.959> some

control<00:02:44.730> gets<00:02:45.730> food<00:02:46.000> real<00:02:46.269> quick<00:02:46.299> but<00:02:46.719> that's

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
control gets food real quick but that's

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.470 
control gets food real quick but that's
no<00:02:47.139> problem<00:02:47.469> so<00:02:47.829> he<00:02:48.069> pulls<00:02:48.819> out<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> sword<00:02:49.359> and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
you're a warrior just so much slow on

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.120 
you're a warrior just so much slow on
that<00:04:31.210> thing<00:04:31.539> it<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.870> crazy<00:04:32.229> switches<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:33.099> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that thing it is crazy switches to a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.890 
that thing it is crazy switches to a
sword<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.550> shield<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:33.969> finish<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.449> guy<00:04:34.690> off

really doesn't have to do much tumbling
dodging<00:04:43.570> or<00:04:43.690> anything<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.949> team<00:04:45.190> is

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
dodging or anything because the team is

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.719 
dodging or anything because the team is
a<00:04:46.199> not<00:04:47.199> really<00:04:47.500> focusing<00:04:48.099> him<00:04:48.310> which<00:04:48.520> is

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
a not really focusing him which is
