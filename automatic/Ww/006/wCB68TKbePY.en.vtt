gameplay on the US air force the mill
jet<00:00:19.009> in<00:00:20.009> some<00:00:20.759> really<00:00:20.970> big<00:00:21.029> plane<00:00:21.859> guessing

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
jet in some really big plane guessing

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.339 
jet in some really big plane guessing
it's<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.070> private<00:00:23.429> jet<00:00:23.669> so<00:00:24.150> let's<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.050> ahead<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
it's a private jet so let's go ahead and

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.600 
it's a private jet so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:30.439> features<00:00:31.439> cover<00:00:31.859> hold<00:00:32.310> up<00:00:32.460> at

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
get in it features cover hold up at

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.320 
get in it features cover hold up at
least<00:00:32.759> 10<00:00:33.000> people<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.620> more<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.790> um

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.860 

apparently<00:00:39.330> is<00:00:39.480> pretty<00:00:39.900> slow<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.560> ground

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.720 

yeah<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.380> really<00:00:46.860> slow<00:00:47.070> plane<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
yeah it is a really slow plane it's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.450 
yeah it is a really slow plane it's
pretty<00:00:48.000> big<00:00:48.300> -<00:00:51.830> let's<00:00:52.830> go<00:00:52.980> ahead<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> test

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pretty big - let's go ahead and test

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.110 
pretty big - let's go ahead and test
this<00:00:55.700> speed

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this speed

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
this speed
there<00:00:57.450> goes<00:00:57.660> best<00:00:57.870> possible<00:00:58.670> monster<00:00:59.670> that's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there goes best possible monster that's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.160 
there goes best possible monster that's
how<00:01:00.150> good<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.420> turns<00:01:02.300> I'm<00:01:03.300> fast<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.870> goes<00:01:03.990> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
how good it turns I'm fast it goes it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.490 
how good it turns I'm fast it goes it's
spinning<00:01:05.510> imma<00:01:06.510> testing<00:01:06.900> different<00:01:07.650> ways<00:01:07.980> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
spinning imma testing different ways and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:21.989 
spinning imma testing different ways and
to<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.830> he<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.010> do

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.300 

yeah<00:01:22.999> that's<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.719> pretty<00:01:24.020> good<00:01:24.170> turning<00:01:24.679> it's<00:01:25.039> a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
yeah that's a pretty good turning it's a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:38.139 
yeah that's a pretty good turning it's a
little<00:01:25.609> slow<00:01:25.909> but

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.010 

I'm<00:01:38.689> not<00:01:38.810> gonna<00:01:38.990> make<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:40.210> only<00:01:41.210> share<00:01:41.750> me

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I'm not gonna make that only share me

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.310 
I'm not gonna make that only share me
dead<00:01:42.289> I<00:01:43.240> don't<00:01:44.240> make<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:44.899> need<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
dead I don't make that but I need it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.510 
dead I don't make that but I need it
well<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.429> really<00:01:46.670> good<00:01:46.759> plan<00:01:47.000> BAM<00:01:52.840> I

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
well this is a really good plan BAM I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.300 
well this is a really good plan BAM I
wasn't<00:01:55.520> paying<00:01:55.909> attention<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.569> that<00:01:57.310> but

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
wasn't paying attention to that but

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.529 
wasn't paying attention to that but
whatever

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
whatever

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:08.229 
whatever
so<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:02.569> turning<00:02:03.049> is<00:02:03.170> not<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.619> great<00:02:07.239> can't

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
so this turning is not that great can't

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:20.850 
so this turning is not that great can't
fly<00:02:08.420> backwards<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:09.319> kind<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.590> tough

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.869 

alright<00:02:21.860> guys<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.370> let's<00:02:22.400> give<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.790> another

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
alright guys so let's give it another

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.500 
alright guys so let's give it another

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
I'm kind of Christ and I make Bank Arena

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.360 
I'm kind of Christ and I make Bank Arena
first<00:02:26.989> drive<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> shouldn't<00:02:27.980> better<00:02:28.250> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
first drive so I shouldn't better this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.610 
first drive so I shouldn't better this
time

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
time

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.069 
time
alright<00:02:30.620> on<00:02:31.120> take<00:02:32.120> some<00:02:32.239> height<00:02:32.480> some<00:02:32.780> speed

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
alright on take some height some speed

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:42.900 
alright on take some height some speed
and<00:02:34.180> let's<00:02:35.180> test<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.629> bad<00:02:35.840> boy<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.370> spinning

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.759 

KS<00:02:43.910> takes<00:02:44.299> more<00:02:44.569> speed<00:02:46.269> good<00:02:47.269> night<00:02:47.660> -<00:02:47.959> oh<00:02:50.260> hey

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
KS takes more speed good night - oh hey

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.490 
KS takes more speed good night - oh hey
alright<00:02:52.220> let's<00:02:52.549> test<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.780> how<00:02:53.930> much<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.290> can

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
alright let's test it see how much I can

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.390 
alright let's test it see how much I can
do<00:02:56.920> two<00:02:58.239> three<00:02:59.620> four<00:03:01.239> five<00:03:02.680> six<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.160> that

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
do two three four five six and that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.559 
do two three four five six and that
should<00:03:04.639> be<00:03:04.790> enough<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.239> could<00:03:05.359> have<00:03:05.450> done

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
should be enough I could have done

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.740 
should be enough I could have done
probably<00:03:06.260> eight<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> don't<00:03:07.700> want<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.940> risk

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
probably eight but I don't want to risk

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.449 
probably eight but I don't want to risk
it<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.620> don't<00:03:10.459> know<00:03:10.549> mr.<00:03:10.730> plain<00:03:11.030> already<00:03:11.299> huh

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
it I don't know mr. plain already huh

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:23.670 
it I don't know mr. plain already huh
it's<00:03:13.459> also<00:03:13.669> about<00:03:15.370> eight<00:03:16.370> from<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.389> height

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.280 

so<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.460> strong<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:28.240> previous<00:03:29.240> plane<00:03:29.540> that

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
so the strong is a previous plane that

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.420 
so the strong is a previous plane that
was<00:03:30.530> originally<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.970> first<00:03:32.510> updated<00:03:33.020> GTA

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
was originally in the first updated GTA

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.810 
was originally in the first updated GTA
the<00:03:35.650> bad<00:03:36.650> black<00:03:36.980> jet<00:03:39.130> it's<00:03:40.130> about<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.610> same

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
the bad black jet it's about the same

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.510 
the bad black jet it's about the same
size<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.209> little<00:03:41.480> bit<00:03:41.690> bigger<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:42.800> almost<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
size a little bit bigger it's almost a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:55.720 
size a little bit bigger it's almost a
strong<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.230> up<00:03:45.320> for<00:03:45.530> landing<00:03:54.670> it's<00:03:55.670> a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
strong just it up for landing it's a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.090 
strong just it up for landing it's a
pretty<00:03:56.000> good<00:03:56.150> landing<00:03:59.440> all<00:04:00.440> right<00:04:00.709> let's<00:04:00.950> see

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
pretty good landing all right let's see

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.660 
pretty good landing all right let's see
how<00:04:01.250> good<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.610> could<00:04:01.820> turn<00:04:02.090> on<00:04:02.360> ground

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
how good it could turn on ground

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:23.110
