the other hand the loss of minerals are

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
the other hand the loss of minerals are
going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> allow<00:00:43.200> Savior<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.920> expand<00:00:44.430> which<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
going to allow Savior to expand which is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.110 
going to allow Savior to expand which is
what<00:00:44.940> he's<00:00:45.059> doing<00:00:45.270> right<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.539> because

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
what he's doing right now because

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
what he's doing right now because
because<00:00:48.120> silver<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:49.140> lost<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.590> good

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because silver is not has lost a good

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
because silver is not has lost a good
number<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> minerals<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> those<00:00:50.789> two<00:00:51.000> static

number of minerals to those two static

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
number of minerals to those two static
defenses<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> he's<00:00:53.010> still<00:00:53.219> pumping<00:00:53.460> out

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
defenses and he's still pumping out
scourge<00:00:53.789> probably<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.420> he's<00:00:54.600> lacking<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
scourge probably because he's lacking in

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.569 
scourge probably because he's lacking in
minerals<00:00:55.469> he's<00:00:55.649> building<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> lot<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> Ling's

minerals he's building a lot of Ling's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
minerals he's building a lot of Ling's
he's<00:00:57.239> building<00:00:57.570> he<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.079> those<00:00:58.230> two<00:00:58.379> sport

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
he's building he got those two sport

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
he's building he got those two sport
colony<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.100> he's<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.940> fewer

it's really not going to help him attack

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's really not going to help him attack
and<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:15.000> able<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.180> help<00:02:15.240> him

take down the Sabres expansion certainly

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.730 
take down the Sabres expansion certainly
where<00:02:18.660> our<00:02:18.750> saviors<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> allmine<00:02:19.530> more

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
where our saviors going to allmine more

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.690 
where our saviors going to allmine more
gas<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.190> eventually<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> bigger<00:02:21.240> economy

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
gas and eventually get a bigger economy

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.660 
gas and eventually get a bigger economy
and<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.100> Savior<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.520> with<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and so we see Savior here with a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.180 
and so we see Savior here with a
significant<00:02:27.210> force<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:28.130> music<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.160> think

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
significant force of music I think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.520 
significant force of music I think
Silver's<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.210> good<00:02:30.810> ideas<00:02:31.050> purse<00:02:31.200> over<00:02:31.410> here

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
Silver's a good ideas purse over here

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.140 
Silver's a good ideas purse over here
would<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.740> try<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.130> sneak<00:02:32.580> around<00:02:32.760> his

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
would be to try to sneak around his

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.850 
would be to try to sneak around his
middle<00:02:33.270> looks<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:34.230> into<00:02:34.410> Savior's

mineral line and try to take down some
drones<00:02:36.780> which<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.650> looks<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.950> he's<00:02:38.190> going<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
drones which it looks like he's going to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.590 
drones which it looks like he's going to
be<00:02:38.490> able<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.820> right<00:02:38.970> now<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.300> oval

be able to do right now but this oval
it's<00:02:39.720> gonna<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> better<00:02:40.020> spot<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
it's gonna be better spot that out I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's gonna be better spot that out I
think<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:43.260> saber<00:02:43.530> unfortunate<00:02:44.040> can't<00:02:44.250> do

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
think and the saber unfortunate can't do

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.060 
think and the saber unfortunate can't do
much<00:02:44.550> damage<00:02:44.760> two<00:02:45.290> silvers<00:02:46.290> main<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
much damage two silvers main because of

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.970 
much damage two silvers main because of
those<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.610> sport<00:02:47.970> colonies<00:02:48.410> all<00:02:49.410> around<00:02:49.830> that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
those for sport colonies all around that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.770 
those for sport colonies all around that
place<00:02:50.250> there's<00:02:50.850> no<00:02:51.000> way<00:02:51.120> he<00:02:51.240> can<00:02:51.270> break<00:02:51.540> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
place there's no way he can break and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050 
place there's no way he can break and
easily<00:02:52.260> without<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.220> ground<00:02:53.430> support<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
easily without some ground support and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
easily without some ground support and
it's<00:02:54.690> interesting<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.230> may<00:02:55.500> I'm<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.490> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it's interesting we may I'm not sure you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.180 
it's interesting we may I'm not sure you
know<00:02:56.850> Dirk<00:02:57.450> vs<00:02:57.780> zerg<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.110> almost<00:02:58.470> always<00:02:58.770> on

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
know Dirk vs zerg is almost always on

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.640 
know Dirk vs zerg is almost always on
the<00:02:59.280> top<00:02:59.400> level<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.970> mule<00:03:00.810> ascend<00:03:01.290> zerglings

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the top level it's mule ascend zerglings

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.560 
the top level it's mule ascend zerglings
but<00:03:01.860> I'm<00:03:02.340> thinking<00:03:02.730> right<00:03:02.850> now<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.180> maybe

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
but I'm thinking right now that maybe

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.730 
but I'm thinking right now that maybe
one<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.810> these<00:03:03.900> players<00:03:04.080> might<00:03:04.320> switch<00:03:04.530> attack

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
one of these players might switch attack

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.960 
one of these players might switch attack
may<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:04.980> saviors<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> switch<00:03:05.760> tech

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
may be saviors going to switch tech

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.790 
may be saviors going to switch tech
because<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.360> all<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.690> sport<00:03:06.959> colonies<00:03:07.260> he<00:03:07.650> may

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
because of all the sport colonies he may

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.170 
because of all the sport colonies he may
go<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.070> hydros<00:03:08.459> we<00:03:08.580> might<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.030> higher

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
go for hydros we might go for higher

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.199 
go for hydros we might go for higher
level<00:03:09.480> tech<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.310> because<00:03:11.790> he<00:03:11.970> can't

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
level tech and you know because he can't

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.540 
level tech and you know because he can't
break<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.630> very<00:03:12.840> easily<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.770> those<00:03:13.800> mule

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
break in very easily with those mule

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.180 
break in very easily with those mule
escs<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.000> well<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.840> while<00:03:16.650> he's<00:03:16.800> sort<00:03:17.160> of

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
escs and well I while he's sort of

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.880 
escs and well I while he's sort of

break in with me while taking heavy
heavy<00:03:21.660> losses<00:03:21.930> against<00:03:22.350> those<00:03:22.470> spores<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
able to get to silver saviors base

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.720 
able to get to silver saviors base
before<00:03:32.489> Savior<00:03:33.420> returns<00:03:34.160> there<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.430> racing

degree of air superiority as he had

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.270 
degree of air superiority as he had
before<00:04:12.209> because<00:04:12.769> silver<00:04:13.769> managed<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.160> get

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280

to see if save your spot without i'm not
sure<00:05:04.560> if<00:05:04.650> we<00:05:04.710> spotted<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.099> out<00:05:05.250> yet<00:05:05.490> oh<00:05:05.900> now

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
sure if we spotted that out yet oh now

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.990 
sure if we spotted that out yet oh now
yes<00:05:07.200> now<00:05:07.229> he<00:05:07.500> has<00:05:07.740> spotted<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.130> out<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.430> that's

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
yes now he has spotted it out and that's

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.170 
yes now he has spotted it out and that's
going<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.390> hard<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.200> silver<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.970> hold

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
going to be hard for silver to to hold

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.870 
going to be hard for silver to to hold
because<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.919> savior<00:05:13.919> saw<00:05:14.099> is<00:05:14.220> more<00:05:14.400> mule<00:05:14.580> escs

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
because a savior saw is more mule escs

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.550 
because a savior saw is more mule escs
and<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.180> area<00:05:15.510> obviously<00:05:15.660> isn't<00:05:16.080> defended

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
and that area obviously isn't defended

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.850 
and that area obviously isn't defended
from<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.770> ground<00:05:16.950> yet<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.590> know<00:05:19.680> once

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
from the ground yet and you know once

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.520 
from the ground yet and you know once
again<00:05:20.039> i<00:05:20.070> feel<00:05:20.520> like<00:05:20.900> sober<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.110> onus<00:05:22.320> is<00:05:22.410> on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
again i feel like sober the onus is on

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.380 
again i feel like sober the onus is on
silver<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.950> do<00:05:23.070> something<00:05:23.520> offensive<00:05:24.150> here

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
silver to do something offensive here

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.940 
silver to do something offensive here
instead<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:24.930> just<00:05:25.080> sending<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.530> couple<00:05:25.919> of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
instead of just sending in a couple of

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.560 
instead of just sending in a couple of
wings<00:05:26.250> or<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> couple<00:05:26.849> of<00:05:26.910> scourge<00:05:27.180> at<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.360> time

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
wings or a couple of scourge at a time

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.350 
wings or a couple of scourge at a time
needs<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.200> coordinate<00:05:29.039> as<00:05:29.160> tax<00:05:29.490> so<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.180> mule

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
needs to coordinate as tax so the mule

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.240 
needs to coordinate as tax so the mule
lists<00:05:30.660> are<00:05:30.750> kept<00:05:30.930> busy<00:05:31.110> while<00:05:31.560> his<00:05:31.830> legs<00:05:32.070> do

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
lists are kept busy while his legs do

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.100 
lists are kept busy while his legs do
some<00:05:32.430> serious<00:05:32.640> damage<00:05:32.789> because<00:05:33.360> wings<00:05:33.900> will

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
some serious damage because wings will

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.990 
some serious damage because wings will
get<00:05:34.229> destroyed<00:05:34.380> eventually<00:05:35.220> after<00:05:35.669> picking

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
get destroyed eventually after picking

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.240 
get destroyed eventually after picking
off<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.240> food<00:05:36.360> drones<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.840> looks<00:05:37.410> like<00:05:37.590> the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
off the food drones and looks like the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.620 
off the food drones and looks like the
Savior's<00:05:38.580> going<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.760> go<00:05:38.849> in<00:05:38.970> for<00:05:39.150> attack<00:05:39.360> here

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
Savior's going to go in for attack here

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.690 
Savior's going to go in for attack here

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
so we're desperately trying to put up a

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.130 
so we're desperately trying to put up a
sport<00:05:42.210> colony<00:05:42.570> but<00:05:42.660> that's<00:05:42.810> not<00:05:42.900> going<00:05:43.050> to

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
sport colony but that's not going to

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.500 
sport colony but that's not going to
work<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.669> looks<00:05:44.669> like<00:05:44.880> silver<00:05:45.270> is<00:05:45.330> going<00:05:45.450> to

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
work and looks like silver is going to

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.650 
work and looks like silver is going to
lose<00:05:45.630> this<00:05:45.810> expansion<00:05:46.500> Hatcher<00:05:46.800> here<00:05:47.190> and

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
these middle is killing the spire and

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.030 
these middle is killing the spire and
looks<00:07:25.270> like<00:07:25.480> silver<00:07:26.320> me<00:07:26.440> but<00:07:26.620> I'm<00:07:26.770> prepared

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
looks like silver me but I'm prepared

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.110 
looks like silver me but I'm prepared
for<00:07:27.100> that<00:07:27.190> I<00:07:27.430> was<00:07:27.610> unprepared<00:07:27.760> for<00:07:28.030> that

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
for that I was unprepared for that

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.850 
for that I was unprepared for that
because<00:07:28.360> I<00:07:28.480> thought<00:07:28.750> for<00:07:29.110> sport<00:07:29.410> colonies<00:07:29.740> is

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
because I thought for sport colonies is

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.200 
because I thought for sport colonies is
enough<00:07:30.040> to<00:07:30.160> hold<00:07:30.280> off<00:07:30.400> any<00:07:30.580> music<00:07:31.000> attack

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
enough to hold off any music attack

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.850 
enough to hold off any music attack
because<00:07:31.750> more<00:07:31.900> conscious<00:07:32.260> just<00:07:32.410> so<00:07:32.560> strong

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
because more conscious just so strong

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.770 
because more conscious just so strong
during<00:07:33.160> 15<00:07:33.370> damage<00:07:33.760> per<00:07:33.880> hit<00:07:33.910> and<00:07:34.180> looks<00:07:34.630> like

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
during 15 damage per hit and looks like

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.660 
during 15 damage per hit and looks like
Savior<00:07:35.170> is<00:07:35.350> gonna<00:07:35.590> take<00:07:35.860> this<00:07:36.040> up<00:07:36.220> because<00:07:36.340> he
