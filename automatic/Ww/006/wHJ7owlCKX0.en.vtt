really no place to hook it guess it's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.480 
really no place to hook it guess it's
supposed<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.540> hook<00:02:28.720> down<00:02:28.870> there<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
supposed to hook down there and I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.040 
supposed to hook down there and I
haven't<00:02:30.760> really<00:02:30.910> used<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.870> let<00:02:32.020> it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
haven't really used it I just let it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.580 
haven't really used it I just let it
hang<00:02:32.290> inside<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:34.170> doesn't<00:02:35.170> seem<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.470> hurt

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
hang inside and doesn't seem to hurt

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.190 
hang inside and doesn't seem to hurt
much<00:02:35.709> I'll<00:02:35.920> probably<00:02:36.070> get<00:02:36.220> bigger<00:02:36.430> bolts<00:02:36.790> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
much I'll probably get bigger bolts and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.110 
much I'll probably get bigger bolts and
try<00:02:38.200> holding<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.590> flap<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.370> really<00:02:39.880> don't

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
try holding the flap but really don't

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.890 
try holding the flap but really don't
need<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:42.180> when<00:02:43.180> I'm<00:02:43.300> done<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:43.750> now

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
need it and when I'm done right now

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 
need it and when I'm done right now
probably<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.470> hose<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.800> off<00:02:44.890> I've<00:02:45.190> done<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
probably just hose it off I've done that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.330 
probably just hose it off I've done that
two<00:02:45.730> or<00:02:45.850> three<00:02:46.060> times<00:02:46.770> pose<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.980> thing<00:02:48.190> off

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
store it in the garage and it's a really

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.699 
store it in the garage and it's a really
good<00:02:51.910> machine<00:02:52.060> took<00:02:52.630> about<00:02:52.870> two<00:02:53.050> hours<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.530> put

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
around me right around the edge where

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.430 
around me right around the edge where
the<00:03:29.690> Machine<00:03:30.690> leaves<00:03:30.900> off<00:03:32.989> but<00:03:33.989> there's<00:03:34.230> some

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the Machine leaves off but there's some

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
the Machine leaves off but there's some
highs<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.829> lows<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.069> this<00:03:35.310> yard<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.940> have

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
highs and lows in this yard if you have

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.580 
highs and lows in this yard if you have

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
probably not going to pick them up but

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.990 
probably not going to pick them up but
for<00:03:39.510> example<00:03:39.599> this<00:03:40.019> area<00:03:40.410> up<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.650> here<00:03:41.000> this

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
for example this area up in here this

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.479 
for example this area up in here this
came<00:03:42.269> out<00:03:42.360> real<00:03:42.629> well<00:03:42.980> if<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.340> have

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
came out real well if you just have

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.460 
came out real well if you just have
perfectly<00:03:44.940> flat<00:03:45.269> grass<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.959> go<00:03:46.140> over<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
perfectly flat grass you can go over it

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.759 
perfectly flat grass you can go over it
and<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.890> will<00:03:47.010> really<00:03:48.470> really<00:03:49.470> pick<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and it will really really pick the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.479 
and it will really really pick the
leaves<00:03:49.920> up<00:03:50.160> almost<00:03:50.760> like<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.420> hundred<00:03:51.810> percent

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
leaves up almost like a hundred percent

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.030 
leaves up almost like a hundred percent
and<00:03:54.200> here's<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.410> little<00:03:56.400> Bank<00:03:56.640> up<00:03:56.849> here<00:03:58.040> and

completely wet it's a little bit messy
would<00:05:40.639> probably<00:05:40.940> want<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.180> hose<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.509> thing

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
would probably want to hose the thing

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.719 
would probably want to hose the thing
off<00:05:41.960> I<00:05:42.289> don't<00:05:42.830> see<00:05:43.039> any<00:05:43.190> reason<00:05:43.460> why<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.610> can't

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729

off I don't see any reason why you can't
the<00:05:44.330> directions<00:05:44.780> say<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.960> decreased<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.680> axles

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
the directions say a decreased the axles

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.730 
the directions say a decreased the axles
once<00:05:46.639> a<00:05:46.789> year<00:05:47.090> if<00:05:47.240> I'm<00:05:47.360> not<00:05:47.509> mistaken<00:05:47.960> which<00:05:48.620> I

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
once a year if I'm not mistaken which I

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.620 
once a year if I'm not mistaken which I
don't<00:05:48.800> think<00:05:48.949> will<00:05:49.190> be<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.340> problem<00:05:49.610> I<00:05:49.970> did<00:05:50.449> read

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
don't think will be a problem I did read

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.110 
don't think will be a problem I did read
to<00:05:50.780> people<00:05:51.370> they<00:05:52.370> might<00:05:52.520> have<00:05:52.669> had<00:05:52.759> a<00:05:52.789> gear<00:05:53.090> or

to people they might have had a gear or
something<00:05:53.210> strip<00:05:53.840> out<00:05:53.990> after<00:05:54.919> two<00:05:55.099> years<00:05:55.370> one

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
something strip out after two years one

something strip out after two years one
guy<00:05:55.820> read<00:05:56.060> he<00:05:56.690> was<00:05:56.810> able<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.080> get<00:05:57.199> the<00:05:57.320> parts

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
guy read he was able to get the parts

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.200 
guy read he was able to get the parts
and<00:05:57.770> repair<00:05:58.070> it<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.990> I'll<00:05:59.990> probably<00:06:00.199> just

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
and repair it and I'll probably just

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.640 
and repair it and I'll probably just
once<00:06:02.210> I'm<00:06:02.389> done<00:06:02.570> for<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.199> season<00:06:03.410> I'll

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
once I'm done for the season I'll

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.409 
once I'm done for the season I'll
probably<00:06:03.830> just<00:06:04.039> take<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.940> apart<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.300> make

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
probably just take it apart and make

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.640 
probably just take it apart and make
sure<00:06:05.539> all<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.690> gears<00:06:05.960> are<00:06:06.139> okay<00:06:06.440> and<00:06:06.590> if

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
sure all the gears are okay and if

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.670 
sure all the gears are okay and if
there's<00:06:06.919> any<00:06:07.900> strip<00:06:08.900> teeth<00:06:09.169> or<00:06:09.410> if<00:06:09.470> there's

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
any damage to the gears just replace

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.719 
any damage to the gears just replace
them<00:06:11.660> so<00:06:11.930> absolutely<00:06:12.919> incredible<00:06:13.340> I<00:06:13.430> used<00:06:13.610> to

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
them so absolutely incredible I used to

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.189 
them so absolutely incredible I used to
take<00:06:14.240> for<00:06:15.080> five<00:06:15.289> hours<00:06:15.320> to<00:06:16.130> do<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.400> yard<00:06:16.550> and

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
take for five hours to do the yard and

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.550 
take for five hours to do the yard and
zip<00:06:18.199> right<00:06:18.349> around<00:06:18.620> on<00:06:19.780> on<00:06:20.780> my<00:06:20.960> tractor<00:06:21.260> with

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
zip right around on on my tractor with

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.149 
zip right around on on my tractor with
this<00:06:21.740> thing<00:06:22.659> and<00:06:23.659> I<00:06:24.260> actually<00:06:24.740> look<00:06:25.130> forward

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
this thing and I actually look forward

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.010 
this thing and I actually look forward
to<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.669> leaves<00:06:25.820> if<00:06:26.030> you<00:06:26.120> believe<00:06:26.360> it<00:06:26.510> it's

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
to the leaves if you believe it it's
