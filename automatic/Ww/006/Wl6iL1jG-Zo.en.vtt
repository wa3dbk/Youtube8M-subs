the axis component and say the temple
side<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.200> things<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.890> allow<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.209> deliver

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
side of things and allow you to deliver

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.000 
side of things and allow you to deliver
what<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.769> wanted<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.400> me<00:02:20.930> six<00:02:21.930> seconds

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.290 

it's<00:02:26.010> no<00:02:26.220> biggie

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
it's no biggie

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.200 
it's no biggie
so<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> way<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.340> said<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> application<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
so this way I said the application is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.420 
so this way I said the application is
very<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.750> important<00:02:31.350> because<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:32.310> know

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
very very important because you know

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
very very important because you know
