00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 what makes you smile in the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.140
 product but cap jean raimbault bluff or 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.129
 daily is to take a frappuccino 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 with bah my buddy stone rabbit a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.489
 song that you listen in loop 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.840
 so you have to make fun of because 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.489
 I land a little after the battle 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.020
 but right now I'm really listening 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.610
 finally an album I listen in loop is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 the 2006 album I think it's 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 really rock rock rock bottom it's 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.379
 hyper insolent and 1 can finally get 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 was really punk like we like 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.829

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.829
 a lot of that no 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.970
 it really reminds me of superbus and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.300
 it was really something that I love 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:20.400
 girl and what makes you crack 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.410
 in a boy I would say his smile 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 forest that makes me laugh and finally yeah 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.160

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.080
 thing in a good friend what a friend 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.460
 boys it's really that we spend 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.290
 accomplices together and all that is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.479
 really hyper important the recipe that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.910

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 think one day on my channel otherwise 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.810
 recently I did sushi 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.920
 is the video somewhere his match no6 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.800
 very successful 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.710
 the favorite piece of your closet I 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.820
 would say the v neck american apparel 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.200
 it's really a basic frozen in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.009
 all colors a holiday place 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.660
 to uncompress 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.160
 here I would say without hesitation 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.410
 it's really a big session 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.580
 shopping in london from three 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.770
 days with a weight all a girlfriend 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.119
 it's really deadly 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.860
 what are there really people there they 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.060
 do not judge, you can dress like you 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.290
 want the girls and sabine no matter 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.910
 how everyone is really hyper 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.560
 respectful and tolerant it changes 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.000
 really really paris so yeah I 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.920
 should go for a walk to notting 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.630
 hill and then I do not even know the evening 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.220
 I like the so-called thing thing that 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.630
 there there are a few punks and a 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.430
 little hipster and everything and that's really 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.750
 finally here it is really long for 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.950
 me it is the ideal destination for 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.540
 so much more decompress when I 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.590
 go there I'm sure no one 's 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.420
 recognize me nilmar were in the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.340
 street so it's really the people a 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 very scary place for you bats 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.700
 direct like that I would say the subway in 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.820
 did not learn so I spent changed 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.780
 since but I take it at the word either 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.239
 for that I move myself exclusively 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.019

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.730
 really super convenient 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.230
 an advice to the paulette who dreams of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.210
 the only advice I can give you 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.980
 do not expect to become 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.390
 hyper known as we big 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.520
 youtube because we are already there 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.960
 for a long time and good here we have 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.860
 really worked for that but if you 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.690
 want to do it because you have it 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.130
 need health said it can be 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410
 well I do not know if you want that can 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.490
 give the opportunity to talk to someone 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.110
 it's always nice to talk to 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.640
 his home hungry camera so that can 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.900
 really serve as a little therapy in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.250
 basically I can give you 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.820
