 Hello everyone and welcome back to this one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.960
 new episode of the computer museum 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.870
 today I will explain how to connect and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.780
 hear the computer's audio with this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.090
 type of cable the jack to rca cable that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.939
 in this case the RCAs are these objects 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.640
 is this ok at this point let's start 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.189
 immediately then we need one first 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.970
 computer with obviously connected 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.489
 joe vga cable connected to the TV 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:43.129
 and now let's connect it to the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 to the audio then we must first 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:52.760
 obviously connect the jack to the computer 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 in this way ok 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 and then the rest of the cable behind protects 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 at this point we find ourselves one thing 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 such 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 if used in these types of audio cables 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.549
 in and audio out 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 we 're going to put it in audio in in 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.770
 this way as if it were more a stereo 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 ok this point is already over 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 installation and we are ready immediately 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 to try our audio ok at this 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 point we send a video for example 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 and if everything goes well it will start the videos 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.270
 [Music] 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 ok the test is completed as you hear 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.450
 the audio comes directly from the for 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.619
 speakers 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 the TV and everything is working 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.680
