00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.359 

Goodson<00:00:15.839> Chapel<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> westbrook

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
Goodson Chapel is in the westbrook

building of the Divinity School opened

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.029 
building of the Divinity School opened
in<00:00:19.880> 2005<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:22.140> has<00:00:22.289> always<00:00:22.470> been<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> plan

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in 2005 and it has always been a plan

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.460 
in 2005 and it has always been a plan
for<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> grand<00:00:24.150> organ<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.660> part<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
for there to be a grand organ as part of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.970 
for there to be a grand organ as part of
the<00:00:26.130> chapel<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.599> project<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.859> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the chapel so this project is one of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.500 
the chapel so this project is one of
many<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.369> will<00:00:29.550> help<00:00:29.640> complete<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> space

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
many that will help complete the space

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350 
many that will help complete the space
and<00:00:30.840> perhaps<00:00:31.679> even<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.099> importantly<00:00:32.550> help

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and perhaps even more importantly help

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.810 
and perhaps even more importantly help
facilitate<00:00:34.320> worship

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.790 

we<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> homestretch<00:00:45.720> for<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
we are in the homestretch for the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
we are in the homestretch for the
installation<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.790> new<00:00:48.000> organ<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> goods

installation of the new organ and goods

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.920 
installation of the new organ and goods
in<00:00:48.690> chapel<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> each<00:00:50.040> pipe<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.360> Oregon<00:00:51.720> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
in chapel and each pipe of the Oregon is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.790 
in chapel and each pipe of the Oregon is
being<00:00:52.520> custom<00:00:53.520> voiced<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> acoustics

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
being custom voiced for the acoustics

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.220 
being custom voiced for the acoustics
that<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.670> specific<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> Goodson<00:00:57.570> Chapel<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that are specific to Goodson Chapel a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.960 
that are specific to Goodson Chapel a
pipe<00:00:58.920> only<00:00:59.280> produces<00:01:00.230> one<00:01:01.230> tone<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.850> order

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
pipe only produces one tone so in order

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.920 
pipe only produces one tone so in order
to<00:01:03.150> have<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.870> stop<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.770> says<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to have a stop that says that it's a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
to have a stop that says that it's a
flute<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.650> one<00:01:10.650> flute<00:01:11.220> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
flute you actually have one flute for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
flute you actually have one flute for
each<00:01:11.760> key<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.420> keyboard

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
each key on the keyboard

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.350 
each key on the keyboard
or<00:01:13.190> 58<00:01:14.190> fluids<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> art<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> voicing<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
or 58 fluids so the art of voicing is

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
or 58 fluids so the art of voicing is
causing<00:01:18.360> each<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> sound<00:01:19.830> similar<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.399> its

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
causing each one to sound similar to its

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.370 
causing each one to sound similar to its
neighbors<00:01:21.149> you<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> scale<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> ascends

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
neighbors you get a scale that ascends

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
neighbors you get a scale that ascends
smoothly<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> top<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.030> bottom<00:01:27.149> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
smoothly from the top to the bottom of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
smoothly from the top to the bottom of
the<00:01:27.600> keyboard<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:31.580> process<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.729> achieved<00:01:33.180> by

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the keyboard that process is achieved by

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.100 
the keyboard that process is achieved by
manipulating<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.190> different<00:01:35.610> parts<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.149> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
manipulating the different parts of the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.029 
manipulating the different parts of the
pipe<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.180> adjusting<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> wind<00:01:39.509> flow<00:01:40.039> through
