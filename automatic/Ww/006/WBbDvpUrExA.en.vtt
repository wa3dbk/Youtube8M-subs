00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 and everyone I hope you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.890
 okay so I 'm coming back today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.140
 in a video that will be a routine 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 hair is a video I think it 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.650
 I've been asked the most since the beginning 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.719
 from my channel and in the last video 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 you said that I promised that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.080
 I'll do it I just have three 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 products that I do not have here at hand 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
 but that I filmed you apart so I 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.580
 assures you and the visuals in the video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.529
 like that it will be really more practical 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.029
 for you before you introduce all 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.070
 the products I have to see do a little 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 topo on my hair nature and so on 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 then my hair is of normal types 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.660
 I would say they are not especially dry 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 neither fat nor anything I find 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.719
 that they are normal 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.790
 after that, for sure, they are a little bit 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 fat trend i will say one day 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 before I wash my hair 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 example but I have some small 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 hints for that i'm going to show you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 just now if not I can say that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 I have a lot of hair but they are 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 not especially neither end nor sword 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 they are also normal we will say then 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.930
 I will broadcast this video in four 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.850
 small parts I first make the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 part the vase and hair then the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 part drying the part all that is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.570
 mask oil etc and the part we will say 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.369
 between the shampoos not how it's 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.990
 so with the wave part then there 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.700
 I get a first shampoo 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.830
 present like this so it's a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.280
 shampoo in the form of waste pebble 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.080
 lunch 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.490
 so that's just the base I've 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 added biston le gall and introduces himself 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.119
 really like those here and there it's 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 really a brand that I love and for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.729
 hair products still 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.710
 the more I find that we are far from 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.060
 first awesome including this one I know 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 more if I say it is johnny 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.390
 johnny scary I think it's called 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.829
 like that I could not tell you the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 ingredients and that's all I 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.250
 will stay links on guard to foded all 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 sites where we could find the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.530
 products 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.909
 price level it really does not cost much 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.259
 thing it seems to me that it costs to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.000
 around 8 euros something like 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.320
 that and it's really very profitable because 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.180
 that it lasts forever 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 it's been a few months that I use and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 I really do not feel like he's 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 move there with the diminish so here we go 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.049
 that's if you want to invest in these 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.159
 championships alesi because he kills 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.980
 really very very long 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.900
 second shampoo is 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.910
 at l'oréal professionnel it is the 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 purifying shampoo or just for 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.510
 purify and actually if you want between 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.100
 be it all the shampoos that I you 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.380
 present I alternate each time for 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.760
 to change to vary and so that's it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.870
 this one is really very good and the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.460
 roofs very well too 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.690
 and for those who make tables on 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.610
 blonde I think you're going 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.890
 understand what I'm talking about 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.080
 so for montaya die so I think so 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.300
 that the husband pgm tie and dye for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.360
 maintain my blond so he does not read 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.220
 too orange to blond a little yellow etc 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.390
 I use a silver shampoo so 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.550
 it was a shampoo that is colored 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 blue if you do not know blue 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.730
 neutralize the yellow color so that's 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.980
 perfect for removing everything that is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.450
 orange glare et cetera and it's really going 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 revive the world gave it a beautiful 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.050
 blonde color what is it called 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.330
 silver shampoo and that's also the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.010
 L'Oréal professional range and this one 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
 I used it really occasionally 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.690
 that is to say once or twice a month 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.880
 if it's not once because these 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.780
 services still enough hair c1 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.520
 it's aggressive 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.230
 so that's really it to give back 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.040
 a little sparkle it's not used 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.140
 every week 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.820
 then we will go to the drying part 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.070
 hair so you have to know 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.350
 that I almost never use 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.850
 straightener if I do it's very 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.530
 occasionally as for lebouc 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.850
 time for all after heating 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.290
 in quotation marks the only bait 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.850
 reichshoffen that I use it's 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.500
 really dry hair because I have 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.489
 the hair they really know very 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.050
 very very gently 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.510
 for me to dry them in the open air 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.950
 simply unimaginable would never 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.660
 weight and several projectors of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 heat to present to you it depends in 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.390
 renders that I want on my 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.739
 hair so now I'm doing a 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.750
 blow dry to have smooth hair 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.459
 I use a product is protective of 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 heat that is having hair 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.010
 smooth what then this is it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.590
 from the range 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.720
 osys is called smoothing emission 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.190
 heat producers so who 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.780
 implies a format like this and it 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 is almost empty I use every time 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.590
 that I'm doing a smooth blow-dry and if 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.959
 I do not really want a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.310
 nice pike I use the an icon that 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.420
 is also a very heat producer 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.940
 very well so I do not have it handy 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.500
 I would put you like a visual here and 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.870
 when I finish my blow dry I put a 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.850
 finishing serum so antifreeze and 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 this is tight the same range as the 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.150
 heat protector from just now 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.140
 of the osys range in fact almost all 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.280
 the products I present you face 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.859
 hidden my hairdresser 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.570
 so that's the anti freeze serum and 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.280
 brilliant so that really comes as 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.380
 his name tells him to avoid frizz 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.609
 and make the hair a brighter 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.859
 so now we'll go to the 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.510
 part oil mark et cetera so he 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.769
 must know that I use a lot of 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.510
 products like this for my hair 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.859
 you are not all my passions the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.090
 video where would really reign 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.040
 long the day really the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.049
 essential products we will say first 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.300
 1-2 sheshukov day that comes up 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.210
 like this so it's making him lose 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.620
 it's really an anti-breakup treatment for 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.440
 dry hair and abysses 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.240
 I still find it quite effective and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 January alain second that I have not under 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 hand is the home of the rafistoller 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.360
 ch and that's my caraman's blow in 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.900
 mask material for hair 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.300
 damaged 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.710
 it 's not really great it's 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.720
 really do natural things and 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.490
 that's why I like it all the more 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.260
 this product and I find it does 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.750
 really good job it really repairs 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.310
 damaged hair dry especially when I 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.830
 sense that my hair is a little dry 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.300
 especially on the spikes here I do this 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.830
 mask it and frankly they stand out 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.020
 sweet and a moment with a 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.820
 hair hair print repair 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.040
 what you are I use a lot a lot 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.440
 the oils so first I use from 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.030
 the argan oil that I apply in the evening 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.350
 for example really a little small 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.270
 hazelnut in the palm of my hand I 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.950
 warms up and I apply makes sure but 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.560
 tip for example evening before going to me 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.540
 bedtime or the days where and where 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.130
 soils when the hair needs it 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.810
 they really absorb very quickly the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.760
 product it does not make a fat effect or 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.040
 anything and when I lover their 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.090
 make a candy argan oil mask 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.650
 I take some 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.270
 will say before my shampoo if I have the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.010
 time and I close it mask it 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.290
 especially you put length one say to 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.520
 from here I really like all my 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.990
 argan oil hair and I leave 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.449
 ask a few hours and it's really 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.560
 very very very effective I find 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.570
 you have to know that you can use 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.280
 any oil on your hair 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.199
 whether it's 2.8 to connect two oils of 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.750
 sunflower that I have here to show you 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.479
 its eight organic sunflower oil 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.060
 olive oil castor oil 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.250
 finally no matter the oil all used 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.760
 I want to say it will be a good one for 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.320
 your hair 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.850
 I rarely use anything 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.240
 which I'm going small and I have them 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.940
 all 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.290
 but here I alternate each time it is 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.060
 the same when I feel that my hair 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.310
 are a little static it was a little 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.870
 breaking like this applies a little bit 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.030
 in my hand and I'm going like that on my 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.410
 tips before going to bed this the most 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.700
 most often and I find that 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.930
 really feeds very well 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.729
 hair sometimes it's even more effective 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.440
 that it is a product we buy at 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.820
 barber and they really cost more 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.020
 dear there for that they want to test 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.789
 I recommend you highly 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.380
 to try that for me anyway 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.880
 really works really well 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.410
 so that I can keep my 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.200
 healthy hair in quotation marks 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.180
 and spaced ben the appointments to 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.130
 fears and when I want to give a 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.080
 little shot of my own hair between 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.639
 the shampoos I use a shampoo 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.160
 dry and it's really very very very 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.750
 useful I recommend to my % for the 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.389
 girls who have hair on sandstone 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.470
 fast enough and who do not want to get 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.479
 wash your hair every day that 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.979
 would like to space their shampoo and 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.750
 who do not really know how to do 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.250
 frankly finally I'm not going to say that 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.050
 it saved my life because I did not 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.000
 this problem there and it's really very 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.710
 very very useful for having the 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.990
 clean hair a day for example 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.880
 when he starts to become front room 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.830
 the shampoo is really very very 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.349
 effective then for my part I tested 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.450
 the Baptists and that's really where I 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.310
 I stayed we'll say in this range 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.750
 this is really m 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.760
 because I think they already have a 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.290
 really very very wide range does for 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.150
 blondes for brunettes as I 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.590
 here so that is a little bit 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.490
 colorful of the coup we do not see the 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.430
 white particles 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.690
 it's really very very very useful and 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.460
 I just find that they do 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.470
 very good job and costs less 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.880
 5 euros So there must frankly 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.470
 more hesitant to go buy them 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.060
 they are available everywhere 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.970
 now I know I always have 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.560
 monoprix I saw at the leclerc here it is 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.720
 even on the internet if ever a little 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.700
 everywhere if you want to get them 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.140
 so here is my hair routine is 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.310
 now over I hope in any case 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.200

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.580
