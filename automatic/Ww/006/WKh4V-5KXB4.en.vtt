00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
into this thing this area and I ground

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.170 
into this thing this area and I ground
it<00:02:10.649> clean<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.459> did<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.150> things

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
it clean and I did all of the things

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
it clean and I did all of the things
that<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> repaired<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that you can do and then I repaired the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.110 
that you can do and then I repaired the
metal<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.310> leaded<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.270 

but<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> problem<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.280> original

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
but the problem is is that the original

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.570 
but the problem is is that the original
rust<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.810> still<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:30.110> do<00:02:30.379> as<00:02:30.590> good<00:02:30.890> as<00:02:31.129> you<00:02:31.280> can

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
rust was still you do as good as you can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.589 
rust was still you do as good as you can
and<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.150> still<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.700> try<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.150> kill

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
and it's still there so you try to kill

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.479 
and it's still there so you try to kill
it<00:02:35.629> with<00:02:35.900> sulfuric<00:02:36.500> acid<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.069> all<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.340> those

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
it with sulfuric acid and all of those

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.710 
it with sulfuric acid and all of those
kinds<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.030> things<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:39.290> he<00:02:39.709> had<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.250> had<00:02:40.720> Russ

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
kinds of things but he had I had Russ

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
then I would have put the rust bullet on

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.350 
then I would have put the rust bullet on
and<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.090> would

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
put it on both sides of the metal and I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.180 
put it on both sides of the metal and I
would<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.820> never<00:02:55.090> had<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.780> rust<00:02:56.200> under
