00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
ends like I did there and then you're

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.600 
ends like I did there and then you're
going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> staple<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:47.390> into<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> other

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
going to staple them into the other

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.600 
going to staple them into the other
piece<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> cardboard<00:00:51.860> it's<00:00:52.860> better<00:00:53.129> off<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
piece of cardboard it's better off to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.220 
piece of cardboard it's better off to
use<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> cereal<00:00:54.870> box<00:00:55.110> part<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.860> use<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.930> part<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
use a cereal box part i use a part of a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
use a cereal box part i use a part of a
schedule<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.489> special<00:00:59.910> k<00:01:00.090> arm<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.940> because

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
schedule of a special k arm but because

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.020 
schedule of a special k arm but because
regular<00:01:03.660> cardboard<00:01:04.260> um<00:01:04.589> it'll<00:01:04.949> break<00:01:05.280> more

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
regular cardboard um it'll break more

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
regular cardboard um it'll break more
easily<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:07.080> cereal<00:01:08.070> box<00:01:08.310> cardboard<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
easily because cereal box cardboard is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
easily because cereal box cardboard is
actually<00:01:09.420> sturdier<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.549> harder<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> break<00:01:13.310> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
actually sturdier and harder to break so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.469 
actually sturdier and harder to break so
then<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:14.909> main<00:01:15.299> table<00:01:15.600> point<00:01:16.530> um

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
then you have your main table point um

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.070 
then you have your main table point um
but<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:20.689> stall<00:01:21.689> figure

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
but then you want to stall figure

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
but then you want to stall figure
through<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> few<00:01:22.560> times<00:01:22.820> as<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
through it a few times as you can see it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.130 
through it a few times as you can see it
it'll<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:27.110> now<00:01:28.110> it's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it'll go down like this and now it's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.270 
it'll go down like this and now it's
your<00:01:28.560> choice<00:01:28.890> um<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.380> staples<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.070> put

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
your choice um the more staples you put

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
your choice um the more staples you put
in<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> easier<00:01:33.570> it'll<00:01:33.810> stand<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.439> what

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
in this the easier it'll stand up what

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.710 
in this the easier it'll stand up what
the<00:01:35.189> less<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:36.020> I'll<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.229> able<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.590> break<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
the less you do I'll be able to break to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.639 
the less you do I'll be able to break to
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.439> full<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.829> did<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
you can see they full so I did that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:55.069 
you can see they full so I did that
that's<00:01:46.649> tough<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> rug<00:01:51.439> so<00:01:52.439> um<00:01:54.079> that's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that's tough to the rug so um that's

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.590 
that's tough to the rug so um that's
really<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:56.729> also<00:01:57.770> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.600> if

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
too much on put staples in it um because

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.240 
too much on put staples in it um because
if<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:09.899> staples<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> middle<00:02:11.069> where

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
if you put staples in the middle where

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.030 
if you put staples in the middle where
it's<00:02:11.370> already<00:02:11.700> dented<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.470> still<00:02:13.739> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's already dented on they can still go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.069 
it's already dented on they can still go
but<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.549> just<00:02:14.760> won't<00:02:15.030> break<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.569> that's<00:02:19.109> it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
but it just won't break so that's it
