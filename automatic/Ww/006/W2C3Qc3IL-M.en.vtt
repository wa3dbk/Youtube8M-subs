00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the finger technique we're gonna add to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
the finger technique we're gonna add to
that<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.280> exercise<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> finger

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that little exercise the finger

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
that little exercise the finger
technique<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.840> basically<00:00:58.079> holding<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> first

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
technique is basically holding the first

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.569 
technique is basically holding the first
fulcrum<00:01:00.230> let<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.410> stick<00:01:01.680> bounce<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.430> then

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
fulcrum let they stick bounce and then

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
fulcrum let they stick bounce and then
embrace<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.180> stick<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.870> other

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
embrace they stick with the other

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.780 
embrace they stick with the other
fingers<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.920> moving<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> six<00:01:05.880> such<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
fingers and moving the six such as this

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.859 
fingers and moving the six such as this
no<00:01:08.790> rest<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> warm<00:01:09.900> involve<00:01:11.299> okay<00:01:12.299> with

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
no rest and the warm involve okay with

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
no rest and the warm involve okay with
this<00:01:13.049> hand<00:01:13.760> would<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.060> those<00:01:15.180> two

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this hand would be with those two

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.520 
this hand would be with those two
fingers<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.200> traditional<00:01:16.680> grip<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
fingers if your traditional grip and you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.160 
fingers if your traditional grip and you
have<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.909> finger<00:01:21.299> control<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.930> case

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
have this so finger control in this case

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:32.170 
have this so finger control in this case
would<00:01:22.350> be

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.790 

so<00:01:33.180> let's<00:01:33.390> add<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.050> routine<00:01:34.500> where

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
so let's add that to that routine where

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.050 
so let's add that to that routine where
we<00:01:34.920> had<00:01:35.130> wrists<00:01:38.090> housed<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.340> fingers
