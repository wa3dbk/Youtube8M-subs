00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
demo so in a sense it can actually be

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
demo so in a sense it can actually be
harder<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.360> demo<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.810> e3<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.590> boss
