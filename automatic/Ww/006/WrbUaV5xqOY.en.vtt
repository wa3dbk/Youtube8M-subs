00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
obviously just full of pollen but I'll

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.170 
obviously just full of pollen but I'll
let<00:02:30.120> those<00:02:30.300> sit<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> while<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.060> it

let those sit for a while and it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.880 
let those sit for a while and it
releases<00:02:33.480> more<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.019> pollen<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
releases more of the pollen and then I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.199 
releases more of the pollen and then I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.870 

but<00:03:48.610> fairly<00:03:49.030> decent<00:03:49.450> amount<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.840> flour<00:03:50.880> look

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880

at<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.150> there<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.310> still<00:03:54.520> have<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.670> slip

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
at that there so I still have to slip

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.330 
at that there so I still have to slip
through<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.240> there's<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.510> couple<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:56.340> like

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
through it there's a couple of like

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
these flour things will come loose

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.330 
these flour things will come loose
there's<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.440> little<00:03:59.710> bit<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.070> in<00:04:00.220> there

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
there's a little bit of that in there

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.950 
there's a little bit of that in there
but<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.550> can<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.090> tell<00:04:01.270> what<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.690> I'm

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
but you can you can tell what it is I'm

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.260 
but you can you can tell what it is I'm
going<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.170> pull<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.320> out<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:03.550> that's<00:04:03.880> not<00:04:04.060> bad

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
going to pull it out but that's not bad

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.230 
going to pull it out but that's not bad
I<00:04:04.510> say<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:05.050> is<00:04:05.170> really<00:04:05.500> good<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:07.060> it's

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
I say that is really good and it's

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.900 
I say that is really good and it's
really<00:04:07.480> fine<00:04:07.900> fine<00:04:08.320> flour<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.610> means

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
really fine fine flour so that means

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.040 
really fine fine flour so that means
that<00:04:10.120> we're<00:04:10.270> going<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.420> take<00:04:10.600> off<00:04:10.780> we're<00:04:10.960> gonna

it's not a big lake by any means but the

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.240 
it's not a big lake by any means but the
whole<00:04:25.750> entire<00:04:26.199> perimeter<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.770> surrounded<00:04:26.949> by

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
whole entire perimeter is surrounded by

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.909 
whole entire perimeter is surrounded by
