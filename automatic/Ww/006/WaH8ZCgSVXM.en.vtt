00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740
 2 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.480
 Euro 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.570
 45 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
 O 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.340
 yes it was incredibly difficult for us 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.199
 come are well stocked inventory 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.830
 not really so constant in 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.780
 the other one very much this time 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.500
 it wobbled at the end then back 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.880
 after being torn down 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.050
 yes I go now was the 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.050
 decisive point is only the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 not start at the beginning there has 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.830
 robert one properly put in the witness we 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.830
 are quite prone to the whole game 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.040
 ran after were pure emotions 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 the hall whipped up the audience 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.900
 look forward to many spectators and 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.639
 then it is a really cool game and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.350
 he knows the cl of one of our advantages 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.090
 strictly speaking , not at all 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.039
 own fault the simple markup errors 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.120
 you have to say against the concert 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.729
 big risk with the pace we stop 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.889
 to give everything and then comes easy 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.210
 sometimes to errors 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.770
 did not manage to work it out 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.479
 actually managed to get us out of there 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.919
 work well in the end everything 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.729
 works and that everything matters 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.150
 Although we are watching, we have now 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.630
 right 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 at the end are not the today's game 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.220
 Table Leader to stay what you still have 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.780
 a whole excitement as well as in berlin 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.129
 The table leader is not our goal 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.869
 but would like so much 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.119
 she can take her son on a hike 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:32.459
 we have little change possibilities 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:34.379
 But that's something we are aware of as a team and 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:37.739
 that makes me really proud of that 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.209
 whole team the guys is that we 

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:40.229
 We can work together as well 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.800
 if you do not run up at one 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.849
 our at 226 in the field not 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360
 managed to work our out the thing 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.360
 to dazzle
