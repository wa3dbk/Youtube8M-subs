00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
little bit messed up when she was

little bit messed up when she was
shipping<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> guess<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
shipping it I guess but it's just a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.429 
shipping it I guess but it's just a
plain<00:01:13.830> gold<00:01:14.460> bow<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.900> big<00:01:16.170> um

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
plain gold bow and this is really big um

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.370 
plain gold bow and this is really big um
but<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> plain<00:01:18.180> gold<00:01:18.659> bow<00:01:19.020> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
but it's just like a plain gold bow with

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.480 
but it's just like a plain gold bow with
like<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:21.030> holographic<00:01:21.810> kinda<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like this holographic kinda and this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
like this holographic kinda and this
Center<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.909> silver<00:01:24.540> sparkly<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> guess<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Center is silver sparkly but I guess it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
Center is silver sparkly but I guess it
got<00:01:25.740> messed<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.759> shipping

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
got messed up on it when it was shipping

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.630 
got messed up on it when it was shipping
