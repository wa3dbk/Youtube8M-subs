doesn't<00:01:51.990> won't<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.200> searching<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.320> hit

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
doesn't won't be searching and so I hit

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.929 
doesn't won't be searching and so I hit
the<00:01:56.390> Eclipse<00:01:57.390> wyvern<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> graefe

the Eclipse wyvern with the graefe

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
the Eclipse wyvern with the graefe

it with tour guide then just hit for a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.160 
it with tour guide then just hit for a
clean<00:02:03.149> 3000<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.189> than<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.960> would

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
clean 3000 which is more than I would

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.660 
clean 3000 which is more than I would
have<00:02:07.200> been<00:02:07.380> able<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.619> hit<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.340> had<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
have been able to hit for if I had to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.350 
have been able to hit for if I had to
deal<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.140> Eclipse<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.349> burn

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
deal with that Eclipse why burn

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.660 
deal with that Eclipse why burn
and<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.230> bounce<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.710> brow<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.250> graph<00:02:13.430> up

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and I bounce the brow for the graph up

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.150 
and I bounce the brow for the graph up
now<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.570> have<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.900> trench<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.290> set<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:15.950> just

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
now I have to trench all set and so just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.040 
now I have to trench all set and so just
like<00:02:16.280> attack<00:02:16.700> over<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> extra<00:02:17.600> Gannett<00:02:17.870> with

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
like attack over the extra Gannett with

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.830 
like attack over the extra Gannett with
1,300<00:02:18.890> attack<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.880> 1200<00:02:20.300> defense<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
1,300 attack or it's 1200 defense and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.440 
1,300 attack or it's 1200 defense and
then<00:02:21.410> swing<00:02:21.740> directly<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.250> graph<00:02:22.490> up<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:22.820> 3000

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
then swing directly we graph up for 3000

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.720 
then swing directly we graph up for 3000
and<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:24.620> ends<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:24.950> working<00:02:25.160> out<00:02:25.430> nicely

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
and it all ends up working out nicely

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.780 
and it all ends up working out nicely
and<00:02:26.150> I'm<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.260> oh<00:02:27.590> let<00:02:28.190> me<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.490> card

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
soon as the Pulsar hits the field I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.770 
soon as the Pulsar hits the field I
torrential<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:53.060> he<00:02:53.300> summons<00:02:53.690> an

stuff so he someone's Herald of creation

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.009 
stuff so he someone's Herald of creation
and<00:03:31.280> he<00:03:32.120> pitches<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.660> blue<00:03:33.080> eyes<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:34.640> add<00:03:35.019> res

darkness<00:03:36.470> mel<00:03:36.590> back<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.890> him<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.280> i<00:03:37.610> tell<00:03:37.820> him

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
darkness mel back to him and i tell him

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.640 
darkness mel back to him and i tell him
that<00:03:37.940> he<00:03:38.090> can't<00:03:38.120> do<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:39.200> for<00:03:39.500> some

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
that he can't do it because for some

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.900 
that he can't do it because for some
reason<00:03:39.680> i<00:03:39.950> thought<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.250> hell<00:03:40.400> recreation

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
reason i thought the hell recreation

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.150 
reason i thought the hell recreation
only<00:03:41.150> added<00:03:41.390> lights<00:03:41.660> low<00:03:42.200> 7<00:03:42.560> or<00:03:42.650> higher<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.130> I

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
only added lights low 7 or higher so I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280 
only added lights low 7 or higher so I
thought<00:03:43.340> he<00:03:43.430> was<00:03:43.549> going<00:03:43.670> for<00:03:43.790> pulsar<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:44.989> it

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
thought he was going for pulsar but it

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.780 
thought he was going for pulsar but it
actually<00:03:45.470> adds<00:03:45.799> anything<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.370> just<00:03:46.549> didn't

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
actually adds anything I just didn't

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.310 
actually adds anything I just didn't
have<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.120> read<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.480> card<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.230> know

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
have it read the card because you know

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.910 
have it read the card because you know
cards<00:03:48.680> bad<00:03:48.860> but<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.360> he<00:03:50.540> summons<00:03:51.019> pulsar<00:03:51.769> by

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
cards bad but so he summons pulsar by

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.710 
cards bad but so he summons pulsar by
discarding<00:03:52.190> another<00:03:52.430> blue<00:03:52.850> eyes<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.360> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
discarding another blue eyes and a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.449 
discarding another blue eyes and a
darkness<00:03:54.019> metal<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.739> he<00:03:54.860> decided<00:03:55.100> back<00:03:55.340> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
darkness metal that he decided back to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.350 
darkness metal that he decided back to
his<00:03:55.580> hand<00:03:56.680> for<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.769> pulsar<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.370> then<00:03:58.970> he<00:03:59.060> ends

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
his hand for the pulsar and then he ends

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.630 
his hand for the pulsar and then he ends
turn<00:03:59.600> because<00:04:00.410> there's<00:04:00.620> no<00:04:00.890> play<00:04:01.130> he<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.489> do

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
turn because there's no play he can do

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.430 
turn because there's no play he can do
and<00:04:01.850> that's<00:04:02.299> my<00:04:02.450> last<00:04:02.480> turn<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.260> can't

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and that's my last turn that I can't

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.509 
and that's my last turn that I can't
draw<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.799> reckless<00:04:05.019> then<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:07.040> i<00:04:07.070> remove

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
draw on reckless then so i remove

no freckles or no to discard graefe and
draw<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.280> there's<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.970> card<00:04:17.239> destruction

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
draw and there's that card destruction

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.529 
draw and there's that card destruction
now<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.470> destroy<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.130> prime<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.820> Pulsar

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
now I destroy the prime of the Pulsar

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.540 
now I destroy the prime of the Pulsar
that<00:04:21.440> gets<00:04:21.650> him<00:04:21.770> back<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.099> darkness<00:04:22.250> metal

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
that gets him back the darkness metal

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.980 
that gets him back the darkness metal
but<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.910> doesn't<00:04:23.210> matter<00:04:23.300> because<00:04:23.450> he<00:04:23.780> can't

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
but it doesn't matter because he can't

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.240 
but it doesn't matter because he can't
bring<00:04:24.169> my<00:04:24.289> pulsar<00:04:24.710> or

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
bring my pulsar or
