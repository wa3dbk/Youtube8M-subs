in is probably in a cylindrical
container<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.090> then<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.719> put<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.200> some

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
again they're all carefully measured

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.139 
again they're all carefully measured
well<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.460> measured<00:00:41.700> B<00:00:42.059> hallway

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
well we have actually measured B hallway

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.520 
well we have actually measured B hallway
popping<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.390> mustard<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.989> gives<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
popping some mustard this gives it a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.400 
popping some mustard this gives it a
really<00:00:47.100> nice<00:00:47.309> flavor<00:00:48.110> like<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> pepper

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
and then you finish it off with the oil

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.340 
and then you finish it off with the oil
so<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.320> oil<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:59.010> ten<00:00:59.399> fluid<00:01:00.030> ounces<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.140> egg
