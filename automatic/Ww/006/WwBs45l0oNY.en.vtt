right<00:05:55.990> these<00:05:56.230> are<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.740> three<00:05:56.980> things<00:05:57.160> that

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
right these are the three things that

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.480 
right these are the three things that
every<00:05:57.760> website<00:05:57.970> should<00:05:58.450> try<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.690> achieve<00:05:58.840> and

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
every website should try to achieve and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.130 
every website should try to achieve and
that's<00:06:00.490> what<00:06:00.790> I<00:06:00.820> feel<00:06:01.210> makes<00:06:01.630> a<00:06:01.750> good<00:06:01.900> website

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
that's what I feel makes a good website

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.980 
that's what I feel makes a good website
and<00:06:02.560> if<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:02.980> do<00:06:03.160> that<00:06:03.400> you're<00:06:04.060> as<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.480> designer

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
and if you do that you're as a designer

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.750 
and if you do that you're as a designer
if<00:06:05.170> you<00:06:05.260> focus<00:06:05.590> on<00:06:05.710> those<00:06:05.830> three<00:06:06.010> things<00:06:06.220> you

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
if you focus on those three things you

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.510 
if you focus on those three things you
will<00:06:06.880> become<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.150> solid<00:06:07.480> web<00:06:07.780> designer<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.520> so

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
will become a solid web designer and so

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.490 
will become a solid web designer and so

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
I say focus on those three things and as

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.230 
I say focus on those three things and as
a<00:06:11.530> web<00:06:11.740> designer<00:06:12.010> right<00:06:12.760> these<00:06:13.000> three<00:06:13.210> things
