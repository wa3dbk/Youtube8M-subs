00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.990
 [Music] 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.830
 and then I do not have time for all 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.820
 doubts that have sometimes writing you 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.199
 can one explain what in advance 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.340
 I really appreciate the facebook people 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.390
 that follows us 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.650
 enough followers and enough friends 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.380
 let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.780
 raising my way of seeing 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.100
 of the people my sisters and the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.440
 people that work here should the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.090
 parenting as we see it does not want 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.890
 to say that it is a dogma a truth 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
 absolute that in your point of view 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.680
 only and I do it to share with 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.380
 the people who are interested 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.170
 next they ask me a lot hey is that 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.400
 I have a hatch cock with which I cross it in 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.410
 reality for me is one is a question 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.230
 that you can not answer 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.660
 all the caches from one breeder to another 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.310
 They are different every Thursday a 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.320
 creator to another are different us 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.020
 we take off that bandage that for me is 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.880
 a bandage on the races that in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 actually the races are names of races 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.729
 they should only be used in my 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.850
 way to see yes as a kind of talk 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.310
 of a family to identify it and it's 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.540
 why we during the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.520
 course the time that we take 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.070
 creating that we have some families that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.690
 they contract 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
 fifteen 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.460
 we have created our line of fire rex 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.830
 and it contains a little oriental blood to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.040
 what I'm going is the following as the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 we stopped we did not want to 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.500
 the cançó leaves for x or e with 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.860
 X, what we do is the following 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.270
 we have identified such 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.450
 families as descendants of walqa that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 like the clear the cheeses this families 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.720
 leave those that can on the floor and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.180
 families of turns that are like 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 animals that are on the floor we could 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.860
 say that a part of breeding for 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.130
 us in their lines that we preserve 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 play walk that's the right word 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.550
 are several world warriors dumb 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.340
 showers this type of blood see this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.500
 is a part of our breeding itself 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.800
 we look for in that form we look for fund 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.990
 resistance fighting and that gives 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.660
 constitution to the family that gives the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.390
 form the family and we have other 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.090
 families that have speed like those 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.480
 wingate wheat sera if those families 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.490
 that we look for in it speed yes to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.130
 also integrate our cocktail of 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.230
 raising a little bit of them and we have 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.600
 another family that we place on 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.140
 graduates of oriental or some kind of 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.580
 Oriental descendant as 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.450
 They break, so he brunner lazy cowan 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.180
 There are many families d 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.069
 more than looking for families like me 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 I'm saying as names there are 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.180
 look for the individuals with the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.099
 we seek the skills we have a 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.760
 family that we are going to swell 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.430
 castellfort other speed and other 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.590
 skill family and cut what 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.760
 we do is just combine 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.410
 the three families and try to take out 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.380
 a hybrid that is complete 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.170
 that has all the qualities more 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.300
 desirable would be that but that will bind to 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.270
 this whole family of birds are 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.190
 different families because there may be 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.840
 a scatter of characters if you do not 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.210
 we do correctly and leave chile 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.710
 mole sweet what is going to gather all 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.950
 families will do that they are 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.100
 carriers and the other one that is very 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.710
 important that all the bloods that 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.480
 use to get the Indian to hit him what 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.870
 we tell the monkey to hit the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.840
 monkey that is he had not tried throws 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.330
 that do not get anywhere that they use 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.080
 more the wings than the legs each one 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.150
 you can create how you want that is the way 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.970
 in which we see each year 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.590
 our families that require yes 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 they require a little more defense and 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.240
 we put a little more oriental if 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.200
 Some are declining the fort we are not 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.840
 a little oriental 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.670
 some family needs more speed 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.260
 I was looking for 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.770
 if the animals need more 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.310
 constitution plus strength plus conviction 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.320
 We are looking for the right family 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.150
 for saying something I will mention them only 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.270
 a cross so as not to make it too extensive 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.190
 this year we are creating if hens 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.660
 cardinals of the cholito is saw 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.630
 which is a family of construction very 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.790
 strong we are giving those females with 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.780
 animals that brings the percentage of 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.100
 oriental blood the speed we believe that 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.010
 it's very good 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.220
 because it would be accused we have done it but 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.290
 next year we want you to have had 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.920
 some of our clients that has been 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.070
 Excellent 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.010
 to these females that we are going so much 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.940
 put him on tour if it's a crossroads that has 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.400
 worked very well in combat 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.310
 everything that is once not completely 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.630
 an animal of show speed but 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.250
 that the shots he hits are strong 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.400
 effectiveness is what we are enjoying 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.750
 see you in the next and visit the 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.300
