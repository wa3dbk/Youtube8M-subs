the optimum nutrition performance way a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.350 
the optimum nutrition performance way a
lot<00:00:13.070> of<00:00:13.130> people<00:00:13.220> were<00:00:13.430> confused<00:00:13.820> when<00:00:14.090> up<00:00:14.210> in

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
lot of people were confused when up in

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.280 
lot of people were confused when up in
nutrition<00:00:14.720> came<00:00:14.840> out<00:00:14.960> with<00:00:15.080> his<00:00:15.110> whey

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
nutrition came out with his whey

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.440 
nutrition came out with his whey
proteins<00:00:15.740> well<00:00:15.950> I<00:00:15.980> already<00:00:16.280> have<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.700> 100%

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
proteins well I already have the 100%

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.480 
proteins well I already have the 100%
whey<00:00:17.510> gold<00:00:17.630> standard<00:00:18.230> well<00:00:18.410> this<00:00:19.160> is<00:00:19.279> a<00:00:19.310> more

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
whey gold standard well this is a more

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.550 
whey gold standard well this is a more
economical<00:00:19.700> whey<00:00:20.210> protein<00:00:20.600> simple<00:00:21.439> as<00:00:21.529> that

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
economical whey protein simple as that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560 
economical whey protein simple as that
that's<00:00:21.980> why<00:00:22.100> they<00:00:22.250> came<00:00:22.369> out<00:00:22.550> with<00:00:22.610> it<00:00:22.820> the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
that's why they came out with it the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.600 
that's why they came out with it the
market<00:00:24.080> with<00:00:24.230> way<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.710> protein<00:00:25.250> is<00:00:25.369> kind<00:00:25.550> of

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
market with way and protein is kind of

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.010 
market with way and protein is kind of
jumped<00:00:25.850> up<00:00:25.940> and<00:00:26.060> down<00:00:26.150> in<00:00:26.390> terms<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.660> pricing

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
jumped up and down in terms of pricing

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.150 
jumped up and down in terms of pricing
so<00:00:27.110> they<00:00:27.200> put<00:00:27.380> out<00:00:27.470> something<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.860> little<00:00:27.980> bit

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
so they put out something a little bit

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.760 
so they put out something a little bit
more<00:00:28.220> economical<00:00:29.230> pretty<00:00:30.230> much<00:00:30.410> what's<00:00:30.650> in

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
more economical pretty much what's in

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.049 
more economical pretty much what's in
here<00:00:30.920> is<00:00:31.039> it's<00:00:31.160> going<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.340> be<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.460> blend<00:00:31.730> its

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
protein now that's for the chocolate

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.850 
protein now that's for the chocolate
flavor<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.640> when<00:00:47.600> considering<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.620> just

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
flavor so when considering this you just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.770 
flavor so when considering this you just
have<00:00:48.979> to<00:00:49.010> take<00:00:49.309> into<00:00:49.460> account<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:50.449> know<00:00:50.570> do<00:00:50.720> I

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
have to take into account you know do I

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.689 
have to take into account you know do I
care<00:00:51.110> if<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.559> extra<00:00:51.830> carbs<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.460> fat

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
care if there's the extra carbs and fat

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.799 
care if there's the extra carbs and fat
in<00:00:52.820> there<00:00:52.940> does<00:00:53.089> that<00:00:53.120> really<00:00:53.360> bother<00:00:53.449> you

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
in there does that really bother you

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.299 
in there does that really bother you
that's<00:00:54.290> something<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:54.620> consider<00:00:54.769> you<00:00:55.220> know

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
that's something to consider you know

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.610 
that's something to consider you know
that's<00:00:55.489> part<00:00:55.729> of<00:00:55.820> why<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:56.210> cheaper<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.500> know

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
that's part of why it's cheaper you know

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.439 
that's part of why it's cheaper you know
typically<00:00:57.979> the<00:00:58.070> best<00:00:58.250> way<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.519> rate<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:58.970> protein

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
typically the best way to rate a protein

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.789 
typically the best way to rate a protein
in<00:00:59.629> terms<00:00:59.839> of<00:00:59.960> cost<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.290> not<00:01:00.440> only<00:01:00.589> look<00:01:00.739> at

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
in terms of cost and not only look at

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.289 
in terms of cost and not only look at
the<00:01:00.920> type<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.220> protein<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.640> said<00:01:01.790> about<00:01:01.940> how

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
the type of protein that said about how

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.090 
the type of protein that said about how
much<00:01:02.540> protein<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.140> can<00:01:03.260> take<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.530> grams<00:01:03.799> per

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
much protein you can take the grams per

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.280 
much protein you can take the grams per
serving<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.610> multiply<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.570> by<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
serving and multiply that by the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.440 
serving and multiply that by the
servings<00:01:06.890> per<00:01:06.950> container<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.150> find<00:01:08.390> a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
servings per container so you find a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.030 
servings per container so you find a
product<00:01:08.659> is<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:09.200> 60<00:01:09.500> grams<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.830> protein

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
product is a it's 60 grams of protein

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.490 
product is a it's 60 grams of protein
per<00:01:10.250> serving<00:01:10.460> well<00:01:11.390> check<00:01:11.900> out<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.229> see<00:01:12.380> how

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
per serving well check out and see how

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.960 
per serving well check out and see how
many<00:01:12.560> servings<00:01:12.860> are<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.280> there<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.610> also

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
many servings are in there and also

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.120 
many servings are in there and also
compare<00:01:14.510> how<00:01:15.020> much<00:01:15.230> of<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.410> powder<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.950> being

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
compare how much of that powder is being

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.640 
compare how much of that powder is being
taken<00:01:16.370> up<00:01:16.550> by<00:01:16.610> fat<00:01:17.000> or<00:01:17.240> carbohydrates<00:01:17.650> because

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
taken up by fat or carbohydrates because

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.990 
taken up by fat or carbohydrates because
that's<00:01:18.920> going<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.130> play<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> key<00:01:19.580> role<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.790> there

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
that's going to play a key role in there

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.020 
that's going to play a key role in there
as<00:01:20.180> well<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.250> terms<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.550> quality<00:01:22.760> like<00:01:23.000> I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
as well so in terms of quality like I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.550 
as well so in terms of quality like I
said<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.390> about<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.570> step<00:01:23.810> down<00:01:24.020> from<00:01:24.230> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
said it's about a step down from the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.670 
said it's about a step down from the
gold<00:01:25.130> standard<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:26.150> basically<00:01:26.960> whey<00:01:27.200> protein

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
gold standard and basically whey protein

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.630 
gold standard and basically whey protein
just<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:27.980> guys<00:01:28.070> know<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.490> byproduct

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
just so you guys know it's a byproduct

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.420 
just so you guys know it's a byproduct
of<00:01:29.150> cheese<00:01:29.390> manufacturing<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.890> became<00:01:31.160> invoke

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
of cheese manufacturing it became invoke

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.790 
of cheese manufacturing it became invoke
is<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:31.760> very<00:01:31.820> rich<00:01:32.150> in<00:01:32.330> bcaa's<00:01:32.900> it's<00:01:33.500> pretty

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
is it's very rich in bcaa's it's pretty

there<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> protein<00:02:17.470> because<00:02:17.650> they

there with the protein because they

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.110 
there with the protein because they

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960

you need some better probiotics in your

you need some better probiotics in your
system<00:04:01.120> because<00:04:01.300> they<00:04:01.390> should<00:04:01.540> actually<00:04:01.690> be

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
breaking down the lactose for you most

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.370 
breaking down the lactose for you most
of<00:04:03.640> us<00:04:03.700> don't<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.330> ability<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.930> of

of us don't have the ability and of

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.690 
of us don't have the ability and of
ourselves<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.830> actually<00:04:06.100> break<00:04:06.310> down<00:04:06.370> lactose

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
ourselves to actually break down lactose

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.310 
ourselves to actually break down lactose
that's<00:04:07.210> just<00:04:07.390> an<00:04:07.480> indication<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.960> gut<00:04:08.170> flora

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
that's just an indication of gut flora

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.590 
that's just an indication of gut flora
so<00:04:08.740> that's<00:04:09.550> something<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.850> consider<00:04:10.000> if<00:04:10.420> you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
so that's something to consider if you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.900 
so that's something to consider if you
have<00:04:10.780> an<00:04:10.870> allergy<00:04:11.020> issue<00:04:11.440> way<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.490> usually

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
have an allergy issue way is usually

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.000 
have an allergy issue way is usually
less<00:04:13.210> responsible<00:04:13.840> for<00:04:14.080> milk<00:04:14.410> allergies<00:04:14.830> it's

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
less responsible for milk allergies it's

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.620 
less responsible for milk allergies it's
usually<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.280> casein<00:04:15.760> protein<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.450> is<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
usually the casein protein this is a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.690 
usually the casein protein this is a
100%<00:04:17.290> whey<00:04:17.320> protein<00:04:17.770> if<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.520> those

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
100% whey protein if you have those

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.210 
100% whey protein if you have those
allergies<00:04:19.150> you're<00:04:19.299> probably<00:04:19.510> going<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.810> know

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
allergies you're probably going to know

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.830 
allergies you're probably going to know
so<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.520> think<00:04:21.640> answer<00:04:22.000> only<00:04:22.120> affects<00:04:22.420> questions

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
so I think answer only affects questions

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.750
