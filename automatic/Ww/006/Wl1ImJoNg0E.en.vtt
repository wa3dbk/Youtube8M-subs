today<00:00:05.880> I'm<00:00:06.029> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> teach<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:06.840> to

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
today I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.740 
today I'm going to teach you how to
solve<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.380> Rubik's<00:00:07.410> cube<00:00:08.130> using<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.240> keyhole

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
solve the Rubik's cube using the keyhole

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.379 
solve the Rubik's cube using the keyhole
method<00:00:10.460> now<00:00:11.630> and<00:00:12.860> two<00:00:13.860> before<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.880> teach<00:00:15.179> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
method now and two before I teach you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.179 
method now and two before I teach you
this<00:00:15.540> you'll<00:00:15.809> obviously<00:00:16.110> need<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.950> have

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
this you'll obviously need to know have

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.500 
this you'll obviously need to know have
already<00:00:17.759> solve<00:00:18.150> every<00:00:18.689> with<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:20.359> know<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
already solve every with you and know it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.790 
already solve every with you and know it
fluently<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.260> check<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.439> tutorial

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
fluently and so check out my tutorial

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.339 
fluently and so check out my tutorial
here's<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> ink<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> basically<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.349> Keele

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
here's the ink so basically the Keele

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.000 
here's the ink so basically the Keele
method<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> way<00:00:32.400> of<00:00:32.669> solving<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> second

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
method is way of solving the second

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
method is way of solving the second
layer<00:00:36.559> faster<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> way<00:00:38.910> faster

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
layer faster and it is way faster

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.490 
layer faster and it is way faster
so<00:00:40.550> let's<00:00:41.550> scramble<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.809> think

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so let's scramble with you then I think

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.970 
so let's scramble with you then I think
now<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:44.010> start<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> teach<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.870> first<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
now I can start to teach you so first of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
now I can start to teach you so first of
all<00:00:47.040> solve<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> bottom<00:00:47.969> row<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
all solve the bottom row which I'm just

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.100 
all solve the bottom row which I'm just
going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:53.899> okay

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
going to do okay

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.660 
going to do okay
and<00:00:56.239> here<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> done<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.559> next<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and here it's done and then next so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.460 
and here it's done and then next so
three<00:01:00.570> corners<00:01:01.190> not<00:01:02.190> awful<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.780> flick<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:06.470> do

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
three corners not awful just flick so do

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
three corners not awful just flick so do
that<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:12.020> that's<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:15.049> that's<00:01:18.590> three<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that one that's two that's three so now

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
that one that's two that's three so now
if<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.479> look<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> bottom<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> your

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
if you look at the bottom side of your

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.170 
if you look at the bottom side of your
cube<00:01:23.460> you'll<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.360> three<00:01:24.930> corners<00:01:25.560> solved

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
cube you'll have three corners solved

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
cube you'll have three corners solved
and<00:01:28.310> one<00:01:29.310> corner<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.500> self

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and one corner that's not so on on self

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.039 
and one corner that's not so on on self
corner<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.549> call<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.000> unsolved<00:01:33.689> corner

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
corner we will call this unsolved corner

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
corner we will call this unsolved corner
the<00:01:34.259> key<00:01:34.500> hole<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.490> called<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the key hole that's what it's called the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.140 
the key hole that's what it's called the
key<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.009> let's<00:01:38.310> solve<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> edge

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
key on it so now let's solve the edge

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.399 
key on it so now let's solve the edge
snow<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:40.200> find<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.740> edge<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.990> has<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.259> go

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
snow let's find one edge that has to go

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
snow let's find one edge that has to go
in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> second<00:01:44.009> layer<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.460> example<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.939> one

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
in the second layer for example this one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.340 
in the second layer for example this one
blue<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> red<00:01:46.650> so<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> has<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:48.350> rather

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
blue and red so it has to go here rather

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.710 
blue and red so it has to go here rather
lining<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.520> red<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
lining it up with red like you would in

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
lining it up with red like you would in
the<00:01:51.840> beginners<00:01:52.290> method<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the beginners method and then do the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240 
the beginners method and then do the
algorithm<00:01:53.720> I'm<00:01:54.720> depending<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.890> whether

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
algorithm I'm depending with to whether

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.840 
algorithm I'm depending with to whether
it<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> go<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.149> rest<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:58.170> over<00:01:58.409> left

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it has to go on the rest which over left

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.280 
it has to go on the rest which over left
you're<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.210> make<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.509> line<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you're going to make it line up with the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.719 
you're going to make it line up with the
other<00:02:01.500> color<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.340> we'll<00:02:02.579> blue<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.579> what

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
other color so we'll blue so now what

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
other color so we'll blue so now what
you're<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> bring<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.049> keel

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you're going to do is bring the keel

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.310 
you're going to do is bring the keel
underneath<00:02:08.009> where<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.340> has<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> go<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
underneath where it has to go in this

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.470 
underneath where it has to go in this
case<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.709> already<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.810> turn<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:14.280> side

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
case you already is and turn the side

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.710 
case you already is and turn the side
where<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.620> edge<00:02:16.860> isn't<00:02:17.819> up<00:02:18.510> turn<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.409> up<00:02:19.650> now

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
where the edge isn't up turn it up now

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.140 
where the edge isn't up turn it up now
line<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.200> edge<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:24.170> bring<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> down

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
line up the edge and bring it down

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.979 
line up the edge and bring it down
you've<00:02:27.150> got<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.510> edge<00:02:27.599> sold<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:29.580> let<00:02:30.510> me<00:02:30.720> give

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
you've got the edge sold now let me give

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.130 
you've got the edge sold now let me give
you<00:02:31.080> another<00:02:31.110> example<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:33.510> there's<00:02:33.870> another

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
you another example here there's another

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.059 
you another example here there's another
edge<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.129> line<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.489> with<00:02:35.760> green<00:02:36.830> us<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
edge so we line it up with green us to

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.330 
edge so we line it up with green us to
go<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:38.879> bring<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.360> key<00:02:39.629> hold<00:02:39.870> hand

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
go here so we bring the key hold hand

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.530 
go here so we bring the key hold hand
bring<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.549> side<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:43.670> line<00:02:44.670> up<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.000> edge<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
bring this side up line up the edge and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.360 
bring this side up line up the edge and
bring<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.930> back<00:02:46.079> down<00:02:46.290> when<00:02:46.920> you're<00:02:47.069> going<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
bring it back down when you're going to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:57.050
