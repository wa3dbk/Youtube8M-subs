00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
elements of this project was to make

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.050 
elements of this project was to make
sure<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:31.110> new<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.620> old<00:03:32.060> worked

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
sure that that new and old worked

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.910 
sure that that new and old worked
together<00:03:33.329> rather<00:03:33.900> than<00:03:34.049> against<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:34.650> another

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
together rather than against one another

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.560 
together rather than against one another
so<00:03:35.910> from<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> outset<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:37.079> had<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.519> pretty<00:03:38.570> good

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
so from the outset we had a pretty good

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.270 
so from the outset we had a pretty good
dialogue<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.230> with<00:03:40.560> English<00:03:40.829> heritage

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.580

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.750 
and with Camden as a local authority to
get<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.950> balance<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.730> old<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.360> new<00:03:45.709> right

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
get that balance of old and new right

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
get that balance of old and new right
and<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:48.720> they<00:03:48.900> really<00:03:49.230> appreciated<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
and I think they really appreciated the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.710 
and I think they really appreciated the
fact<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.430> were<00:03:50.580> working<00:03:50.970> hard<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.569> we

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
fact that we were working hard as we

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.559 
fact that we were working hard as we
could<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.959> get<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> old<00:03:52.590> station<00:03:53.569> restored

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
could to get the old station restored

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.170 
could to get the old station restored
and<00:03:54.900> repaired<00:03:55.230> but<00:03:56.129> also<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:57.000> new

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and repaired but also that the new

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.410 
and repaired but also that the new
elements<00:03:57.780> would<00:03:58.560> sort<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.860> relate<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.760> an

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
elements would sort of relate in an

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.570 
elements would sort of relate in an
appropriate<00:04:01.110> way<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.769> old<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.370> for

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
appropriate way to the old so for

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.430 
appropriate way to the old so for
instance<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.150> scale<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> Concorde<00:04:04.260> this

instance the scale of the Concorde this

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.520 
instance the scale of the Concorde this
new<00:04:04.650> piece<00:04:04.920> although<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.150> looks<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:07.379> know

new piece although it looks you know

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.009 
new piece although it looks you know
incredible<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.519> its<00:04:08.670> scale<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.150> actually<00:04:09.629> sits

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
incredible in its scale it actually sits

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.309 
incredible in its scale it actually sits
below<00:04:10.500> them<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.640> eve<00:04:11.849> site<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.870> Western

below them the eve site of the Western

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.589 
below them the eve site of the Western
range<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.670> means<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.209> from<00:04:15.360> all

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
range and it means that from all

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.199 
range and it means that from all
external<00:04:16.079> positions<00:04:16.829> you<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.190> still<00:04:17.489> see<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
external positions you can still see the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.659 
external positions you can still see the
historic<00:04:18.750> building<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:20.340> think<00:04:20.370> that's

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
historic building and I think that's

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.370 
historic building and I think that's
hard<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.030> believe<00:04:21.120> when<00:04:21.389> you're<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:22.139> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
hard to believe when you're in it but I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.810 
hard to believe when you're in it but I
think<00:04:22.650> that's<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.250> keep<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.729> other

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
think that's that's a keep on the other

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.450 
think that's that's a keep on the other
of<00:04:24.030> course<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.539> you<00:04:24.690> reveal<00:04:25.460> this

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
of course is that you reveal this

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.180 
of course is that you reveal this
historic<00:04:27.000> facade<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.660> western<00:04:28.110> facade<00:04:28.740> of

historic facade the western facade of
the<00:04:29.310> western<00:04:29.729> range<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.800> think

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
the western range and you know I think

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.980 
the western range and you know I think
that<00:04:32.160> combination<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.850> revealing<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
that combination of revealing it and and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.560 
that combination of revealing it and and
and<00:04:34.729> juxtapose<00:04:35.729> that<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.180> adjust<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and juxtapose that can adjust the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.939 
and juxtapose that can adjust the
position<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.169> with<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> new<00:04:37.650> piece

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.529 
position of that with the new piece
