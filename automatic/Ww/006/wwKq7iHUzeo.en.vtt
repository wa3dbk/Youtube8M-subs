00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.760
 hello friends we have such 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.340
 small statistical analysis 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.000
 September 9, that is, not another 3 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.540
 months 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.900
 well, close to September 9, then I 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.250
 said that here we have 20 thousand 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.800
 subscribers and in the contest there is a video 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.770
 staged and so there was some kind of activity 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.470
 about this means today is tuesday 3 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.760
 December today we have quantity 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.329
 subscribers became 28 thousand crossed 28 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.420
 thousand mark and somehow it is 40 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.670
 percent i want to say that 40 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.430
 percent increase in less than three months 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.540
 this is something hard to believe in that 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.259
 it happens and I on the one hand as if in 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.450
 delighted in such in purely in human 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.560
 here on the other hand I wanted with you too 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.359
 share and there is still interesting 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.579
 once i have some video like this 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:21.289
 posted by some statistics 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.889
 data just subscription we have there 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.819
 visiting this views for here in this 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:28.100
 in this moment 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.889
 some people unsubscribe 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.859
 such as a sharp increase in activity by 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:36.049
 from cheating here that is a man 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.539
 so why am I there how to start 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.179
 some kind of alien is not statistics but 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.060
 the most interesting is that the same video 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.740
 this same day is causing more 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.459
 subscribers there are people who 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.079
 how to look necessary but not signed and 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.419
 some say I signed need to unsubscribe 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.359
 from others they say I am not signed 

00:01:53.419 --> 00:02:01.009
 sign up here I mean those who are in 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:03.439
 the second part of them is more so we have 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.349
 more subscribers in general I still want 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.220
 say that due to the fact that here is clearly 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:17.150
 the other day here the video hung well some such 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.490
 with an expression of sympathy for our viewers 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 who are now on the Maidan and somehow 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.160
 there are actively involved in this in all and 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 there was some unusual amount there 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.140
 the number of dizlaikov there type there 15 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.570
 percent so usually we sit up to three 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.320
 So I think it's interesting how it is 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.990
 will affect the statistics on ours there from 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
 cheating from the channel is also the same 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.120
 to the previous two days and then completely 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.610
 there is no splash and I kind of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.300
 in a sense 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.490
 Well, how would you be proud of our audience ? 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.740
 for people who look at that 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.890
 how could there be all this differently 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.470
 see but in general something of us so 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.860
 combines more than some 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.850
 there is disagreement on specific issues of 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.850
 or other so 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.299
 I wanted to tell you thanks to those who 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.849
 despite the fact that may not be very 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.060
 it was nice to hear what he said but 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:27.890
 general and we are like on the same platform we 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.940
 one blood you me yes how we have fairy tales 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.940
 says so 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.780
 we have a lot more to come 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 enemies and 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.319
 excursion on stanford and now we 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.080
 We are starting a new construction cycle in 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.000
 united states he literally through 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.020
 an hour will come to my home 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 marrying it 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.370
 contract we will remove him today 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.530
 a couple may already be small ticks 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.569
 he is such a serious contractor already in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.520
 America has been doing this for 20 years 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.480
 of this he worked for many years in the USSR 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.800
 Russia in Moscow in Ukraine therefore I 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.019
 I think that he has something to tell and yours 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.390
 questions will also be marked with 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.209
 by gratitude that is, here it is somehow 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.220
 interested in order to connect to 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.490
 the work of our channel and i think that we 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.940
