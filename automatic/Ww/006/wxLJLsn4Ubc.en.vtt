reality<00:01:07.130> if<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.580> create<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.270> technology<00:01:08.570> if

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
reality if we create this technology if

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.860 
reality if we create this technology if
things<00:01:10.070> are<00:01:10.310> exponentially<00:01:11.150> getting<00:01:11.450> better

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
things are exponentially getting better

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.390 
things are exponentially getting better
and<00:01:12.080> better<00:01:12.140> better<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.770> processor<00:01:13.310> our

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
and better better the processor our

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.550 
and better better the processor our
computers<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.090> if<00:01:14.540> we<00:01:14.750> create<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.260> from<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
computers and if we create it from the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.770 
computers and if we create it from the
ground<00:01:15.740> up<00:01:16.010> can<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.640> take<00:01:16.820> over<00:01:17.060> hasn't<00:01:17.659> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
ground up can it take over hasn't the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.360 
ground up can it take over hasn't the
movies<00:01:18.140> taught<00:01:18.380> us<00:01:18.500> anything<00:01:18.680> wouldn't<00:01:19.220> we

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
movies taught us anything wouldn't we

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.370 
movies taught us anything wouldn't we
have<00:01:19.520> like<00:01:19.700> an<00:01:19.850> off<00:01:20.060> switch<00:01:20.300> or<00:01:20.780> an<00:01:20.870> override

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
have like an off switch or an override

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.530 
have like an off switch or an override
how<00:01:21.979> would<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.370> happen<00:01:22.940> could<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.300> happen

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
how would this happen could this happen

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.030 
how would this happen could this happen
and<00:01:23.900> that's<00:01:24.050> what<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.409> discussion<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:24.950> about

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
and that's what the discussion is about

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.610 
and that's what the discussion is about
hockey-stick<00:01:25.850> robots<00:01:26.570> could<00:01:26.780> take<00:01:27.050> over<00:01:27.290> it

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
hockey-stick robots could take over it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.200 
hockey-stick robots could take over it
does<00:01:27.800> happen<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.100> movies<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.580> if<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> humans

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
does happen the movies and if the humans

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.240 
does happen the movies and if the humans
are<00:01:29.390> very<00:01:29.750> destructive<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.740> was<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
are very destructive that was one of the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.800 
are very destructive that was one of the
arguments<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.940> robots<00:01:32.240> made<00:01:32.450> he<00:01:32.660> was<00:01:32.750> a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
arguments of the robots made he was a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.150 
arguments of the robots made he was a
destructive<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.470> we're<00:01:33.590> trying<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.830> save<00:01:34.040> you

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
destructive so we're trying to save you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.740 
destructive so we're trying to save you
from<00:01:34.190> yourselves<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.880> think<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.300> that's<00:01:35.480> kind

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
from yourselves I think that that's kind

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.790 
from yourselves I think that that's kind
of<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.900> fair<00:01:36.080> point<00:01:36.320> there's<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.710> many

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
of a fair point there's so many

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.190 
of a fair point there's so many
ridiculous<00:01:37.310> wars<00:01:37.700> over<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.150> most<00:01:38.300> stupid

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
ridiculous wars over the most stupid

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.350 
ridiculous wars over the most stupid
reason<00:01:39.590> ever<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.220> mean<00:01:40.370> we<00:01:40.520> are<00:01:40.640> stupid<00:01:41.210> as<00:01:41.300> a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
reason ever I mean we are stupid as a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.120 
reason ever I mean we are stupid as a
human<00:01:41.690> race<00:01:41.840> by<00:01:42.020> are<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.230> that<00:01:42.440> stupid<00:01:42.920> Jews

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
human race by are we that stupid Jews

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.670 
human race by are we that stupid Jews
for<00:01:43.550> those<00:01:43.700> robots<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.390> exist<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:45.110> stupid

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
for those robots to exist as stupid

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.590 
for those robots to exist as stupid
people<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.160> make<00:01:46.310> them<00:01:46.550> right<00:01:46.820> exactly

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
people have to make them right exactly

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.060 
people have to make them right exactly
and<00:01:47.690> that's<00:01:47.870> my<00:01:48.290> point<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:48.800> might<00:01:48.890> be<00:01:48.950> a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
and that's my point there might be a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.830 
and that's my point there might be a
glitch<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.580> robots<00:01:49.910> might<00:01:50.090> try<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.540> hurt

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
glitch and the robots might try to hurt

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.900 
glitch and the robots might try to hurt
us<00:01:51.080> or<00:01:51.290> fight<00:01:51.530> back<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.400> called<00:01:52.640> any

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
us or fight back what is this called any

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.720 
us or fight back what is this called any
black<00:01:53.240> ops<00:01:53.480> 2<00:01:53.750> yeah<00:01:54.350> in<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.860> game<00:01:55.160> basically

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
black ops 2 yeah in that game basically

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.610 
black ops 2 yeah in that game basically
somebody<00:01:56.210> takes<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.660> controller<00:01:57.110> away<00:01:57.320> from

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
somebody takes the controller away from

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.590 
somebody takes the controller away from
the<00:01:57.710> government<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.550> controls<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.240> robot

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the government and it controls the robot

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180 
the government and it controls the robot
drones<00:01:59.960> first<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.470> all<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.620> think<00:02:00.680> that's<00:02:00.980> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
drones first of all I think that's the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.190 
drones first of all I think that's the
stupidest<00:02:01.820> storyline<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.660> Call<00:02:02.870> of<00:02:02.900> Duty

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
stupidest storyline in a Call of Duty

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.030 
stupidest storyline in a Call of Duty
game<00:02:03.380> ever

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
game ever

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.990 
game ever
I<00:02:04.070> think<00:02:04.370> that<00:02:04.520> if<00:02:04.670> they're<00:02:04.790> gonna<00:02:04.910> make

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
I think that if they're gonna make

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.970 
I think that if they're gonna make
robots<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.050> they<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.710> these<00:02:06.920> things

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
robots and they do all of these things

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.070 
robots and they do all of these things
like<00:02:07.640> maybe<00:02:07.850> cook<00:02:08.149> us<00:02:08.300> dinner<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.660> clean<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
like maybe cook us dinner and clean the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680 
like maybe cook us dinner and clean the
carpets<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.709> whatnot<00:02:10.099> I<00:02:10.340> don't<00:02:10.910> see<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.269> future

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
carpets and whatnot I don't see a future

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.520 
carpets and whatnot I don't see a future
where<00:02:11.989> these<00:02:12.230> robots<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:13.099> become<00:02:14.170> dangerous

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.890 

unless<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.489> how

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
unless I know how

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080 
unless I know how
unless<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> government<00:02:22.560> starts<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.610> use<00:02:23.820> this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
unless the government starts to use this

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.480 
unless the government starts to use this
technology<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> government<00:02:26.100> dumb<00:02:26.310> enough

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
technology is the government dumb enough

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.520 
technology is the government dumb enough
to<00:02:26.640> put<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.060> nuke<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> hands<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to put a nuke in the hands of one of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.980 
to put a nuke in the hands of one of
these<00:02:28.650> robots<00:02:28.920> yet<00:02:29.340> has<00:02:29.550> its<00:02:29.760> own<00:02:29.910> technology

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.320 

through<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.110> computer<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.740> already<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.330> know

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
through a computer it's already you know

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
through a computer it's already you know
but<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> computer<00:02:36.960> itself<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.770> making

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
but the computer itself is not making

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.010 
but the computer itself is not making
the<00:02:38.250> decision<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> show<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.270> or<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.540> probably

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
the decision to show it or not probably

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.360 
the decision to show it or not probably
by<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.350> putting<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.980> ball<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
by now that putting that a ball on a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
by now that putting that a ball on a
drone<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:41.940> something<00:02:42.300> yeah<00:02:42.510> yes<00:02:42.870> they're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
drone or something yeah yes they're

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
drone or something yeah yes they're
controlling<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.340> happens<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.330> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
controlling it but what happens is a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.090 
controlling it but what happens is a
glitch<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.500> has<00:02:46.620> nothing<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.070> with

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
glitch and that has nothing to do with

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.410 
glitch and that has nothing to do with
the<00:02:47.280> robot<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.060> error

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the robot I'm in error

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
the robot I'm in error
what<00:02:48.570> does<00:02:48.660> no<00:02:48.840> no<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.200> anything<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.520> an

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
what does no no if anything it's you an

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
what does no no if anything it's you an
error<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.450> could<00:02:51.630> say<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.960> about

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
error but you could say that about

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.050 
error but you could say that about
everything<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.770> robot<00:02:53.190> does<00:02:53.490> because<00:02:53.880> we

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
everything a robot does because we

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
everything a robot does because we
created<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.690> yeah<00:02:54.990> maybe<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.500> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
created it yeah maybe there was a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.080 
created it yeah maybe there was a
problem<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.950> programming<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.610> AI<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
problem in the programming of the AI and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.810 
problem in the programming of the AI and
the<00:02:57.180> robot<00:02:57.570> itself<00:02:58.459> discovered<00:02:59.459> new<00:02:59.790> things

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
the robot itself discovered new things

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.440 
the robot itself discovered new things
well<00:03:00.510> yeah<00:03:00.690> that's<00:03:00.870> what<00:03:01.140> AI<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.700> really<00:03:02.700> up

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
well yeah that's what AI is really up

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
well yeah that's what AI is really up
until<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:03.870> simulated<00:03:04.620> right<00:03:04.770> exactly<00:03:05.250> so

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
until now simulated right exactly so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
until now simulated right exactly so
everything<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.090> they're<00:03:06.240> doing<00:03:06.270> right<00:03:06.660> now

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
everything that they're doing right now

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620 
everything that they're doing right now
in<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> robot<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:08.070> all<00:03:08.370> us<00:03:08.610> still<00:03:09.000> big<00:03:09.300> blue

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
in the robot is all us still big blue

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.470 
in the robot is all us still big blue
beat<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> human<00:03:11.010> at<00:03:11.130> chess<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:11.910> programmed

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
beat a human at chess but we programmed

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.660 
beat a human at chess but we programmed
it<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:13.110> do<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> go<00:03:14.160> off<00:03:14.400> and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
it to just do that can it go off and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.550 
it to just do that can it go off and
learn<00:03:14.730> how<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.940> make<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.450> pasta<00:03:15.690> primavera<00:03:16.080> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
learn how to make like pasta primavera I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.710 
learn how to make like pasta primavera I
don't<00:03:16.920> know<00:03:17.040> probably<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.209> think<00:03:18.540> when

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
don't know probably not I think when

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.540 
don't know probably not I think when
this<00:03:18.900> does<00:03:19.140> happen<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.709> will<00:03:19.950> happen<00:03:20.400> when

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
this does happen and will happen when

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.880 
this does happen and will happen when
computers<00:03:21.030> get<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.240> smart<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.020> will<00:03:22.530> start

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
computers get so smart that will start

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.710 
computers get so smart that will start
asking<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.430> questions<00:03:23.459> sorry<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:24.480> home

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
asking it questions sorry I'm home

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.759 
asking it questions sorry I'm home
turned<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.200> lights<00:03:25.410> cook<00:03:25.680> me<00:03:25.830> dinner

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
turned on the lights cook me dinner

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.920 
turned on the lights cook me dinner
well<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:29.550> stuff<00:03:29.820> already<00:03:30.120> exists<00:03:30.570> it's<00:03:30.750> just

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
well that stuff already exists it's just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.720 
well that stuff already exists it's just
not<00:03:31.110> cheap<00:03:31.560> enough<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:32.070> all<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.310> us<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.580> use

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
not cheap enough for all of us to use

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.970 
not cheap enough for all of us to use
but<00:03:33.150> my<00:03:33.510> point<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.800> make<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but my point here is you have to make a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370 
but my point here is you have to make a
choice<00:03:35.220> B<00:03:35.670> with<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.940> technology<00:03:36.600> or<00:03:36.870> get<00:03:37.170> left

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
choice B with the technology or get left

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.960 
choice B with the technology or get left
behind<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:37.890> we<00:03:37.920> actually<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.489> implant

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
behind where we actually have to implant

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.430 
behind where we actually have to implant
yourself<00:03:39.360> with<00:03:39.540> certain<00:03:39.810> things<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:40.080> they'e

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
yourself with certain things like they'e

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.320 
yourself with certain things like they'e
sex<00:03:40.739> human<00:03:41.010> revolution<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:41.760> there<00:03:42.120> will

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
sex human revolution I think there will

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.240 
sex human revolution I think there will
be<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.600> war<00:03:42.900> people<00:03:43.230> who<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:43.620> all<00:03:43.800> for<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
be a war people who are all for the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.340

about I realize how broad this talk do
you<00:04:50.620> think<00:04:50.800> technology<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.280> going<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.580> so

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
you think technology is going to get so

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.460 
you think technology is going to get so
advantage<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.780> gonna<00:04:52.900> be<00:04:53.050> able<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.260> take

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
advantage it's gonna be able to take

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.710 
advantage it's gonna be able to take
over<00:04:53.710> us<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.340> human<00:04:54.639> race<00:04:54.820> tell<00:04:55.449> us<00:04:55.540> what<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
over us the human race tell us what you

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.689 
over us the human race tell us what you
guys<00:04:55.870> think<00:04:56.199> it's<00:04:56.350> impossible<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.070> even<00:04:57.310> answer

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
guys think it's impossible I even answer

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:57.840 
guys think it's impossible I even answer
it

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
it

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.629 
it
do<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.240> yes<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.530> think<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.860> but<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.040> think<00:05:03.130> we'll

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
do you yes I think but but I think we'll

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.190 
do you yes I think but but I think we'll
be<00:05:03.760> able<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:04.030> stop<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.720> think<00:05:05.110> that

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
be able to stop it I think that

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.110 
be able to stop it I think that
eventually<00:05:05.440> AI<00:05:06.250> will<00:05:06.610> gets<00:05:06.790> right<00:05:06.940> enough

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
eventually AI will gets right enough

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.760 
eventually AI will gets right enough
that<00:05:07.300> potentially<00:05:07.810> it'll<00:05:08.139> decide<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.590> we

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
that potentially it'll decide that we

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.530 
that potentially it'll decide that we
are<00:05:08.800> hurting<00:05:09.520> ourselves<00:05:09.639> too<00:05:10.030> much<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.389> want

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
are hurting ourselves too much and want

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.780 
are hurting ourselves too much and want
to<00:05:10.600> help<00:05:10.720> us<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.229> not<00:05:11.530> do<00:05:11.740> that<00:05:11.889> let's<00:05:12.460> say<00:05:12.610> you

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
to help us to not do that let's say you

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.170
