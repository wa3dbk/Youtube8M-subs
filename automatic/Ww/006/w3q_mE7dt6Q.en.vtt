00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
little trouble spotting him through the

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.950 
little trouble spotting him through the
fog<00:00:20.199> and<00:00:20.410> everything<00:00:20.740> but<00:00:20.920> uh<00:00:20.980> I<00:00:21.869> didn't<00:00:22.869> get

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
fog and everything but uh I didn't get

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.529 
fog and everything but uh I didn't get
that<00:00:23.230> much<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.860> do<00:00:24.010> but<00:00:24.610> I<00:00:24.670> think<00:00:25.240> our<00:00:25.360> DS

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
that much to do but I think our DS

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.980 
that much to do but I think our DS
played<00:00:25.990> real<00:00:26.590> good<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.039> I<00:00:27.520> felt<00:00:28.510> confident

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
played real good and I felt confident

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.140 
played real good and I felt confident
with<00:00:29.199> him<00:00:29.289> basically<00:00:30.279> my<00:00:30.430> philosophy<00:00:31.000> for

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
with him basically my philosophy for

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.790 
with him basically my philosophy for
this<00:00:31.300> game<00:00:31.480> was<00:00:31.660> just<00:00:31.810> you<00:00:32.020> know<00:00:32.079> jump<00:00:32.529> on<00:00:32.680> them

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
this game was just you know jump on them

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.410 
this game was just you know jump on them
quick<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.250> just<00:00:33.280> do<00:00:33.460> whatever<00:00:33.609> I<00:00:33.760> can<00:00:33.879> just<00:00:34.239> to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
quick and just do whatever I can just to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.119 
quick and just do whatever I can just to
you<00:00:34.960> know<00:00:35.020> be<00:00:35.230> good<00:00:35.379> at<00:00:35.500> both<00:00:35.680> ends<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.100> ice

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
you know be good at both ends of the ice

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.180 
you know be good at both ends of the ice
so<00:00:37.019> you<00:00:38.019> know<00:00:38.109> my<00:00:38.289> first<00:00:38.440> goal<00:00:38.710> was<00:00:38.800> basically

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
so you know my first goal was basically

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.950 
so you know my first goal was basically
just<00:00:39.550> I<00:00:39.760> couldn't<00:00:40.059> really<00:00:40.239> see<00:00:40.420> cuz<00:00:40.659> the<00:00:40.749> fog

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
just I couldn't really see cuz the fog

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.599 
just I couldn't really see cuz the fog
was<00:00:41.109> pretty<00:00:41.350> bad<00:00:41.559> but<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.039> park<00:00:42.219> started<00:00:42.460> just

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
was pretty bad but the park started just

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.009 
was pretty bad but the park started just
squirted<00:00:42.940> out<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.239> me<00:00:43.329> and<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.449> just<00:00:43.479> put<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.899> in

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
squirted out to me and I just put it in

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.959 
squirted out to me and I just put it in
so<00:00:44.319> cam<00:00:44.979> was<00:00:45.100> actually<00:00:45.399> pretty<00:00:45.519> good<00:00:45.789> you<00:00:45.940> know

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
so cam was actually pretty good you know

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.759 
so cam was actually pretty good you know
it<00:00:46.449> was<00:00:46.569> pretty<00:00:46.719> tiring<00:00:47.050> for<00:00:47.229> the<00:00:47.409> most<00:00:47.559> part

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
it was pretty tiring for the most part

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.950 
it was pretty tiring for the most part
but<00:00:47.979> uh<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.449> game<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.780> just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
but uh not just the game to just

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.989 
but uh not just the game to just
practices<00:00:50.499> and<00:00:50.679> you<00:00:51.309> know<00:00:51.399> just<00:00:51.429> coming<00:00:51.909> up

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
practices and you know just coming up

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.369 
practices and you know just coming up
for<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.210> OHL<00:00:52.539> for<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.749> first<00:00:52.989> time<00:00:53.139> and

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
for the OHL for the first time and

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.110 
for the OHL for the first time and
playing<00:00:53.559> with<00:00:53.710> their<00:00:53.829> speed<00:00:54.069> was<00:00:54.370> was<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:54.940> bit

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
playing with their speed was was a bit

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.729 
playing with their speed was was a bit
of<00:00:55.239> an<00:00:55.329> adjustment<00:00:55.420> at<00:00:55.929> first<00:00:56.199> but<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.499> thought

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
of an adjustment at first but I thought

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.169 
of an adjustment at first but I thought
I<00:00:56.769> liked<00:00:57.129> by<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.459> game<00:00:57.639> I<00:00:57.699> thought<00:00:57.940> he<00:00:58.030> did

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
I liked by this game I thought he did

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.180 
I liked by this game I thought he did
pretty<00:00:58.299> well<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.870> while<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.589> new<00:00:59.739> guys<00:00:59.949> were

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
pretty well so while the new guys were

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.979 
pretty well so while the new guys were
certainly<00:01:00.549> a<00:01:00.670> draw<00:01:01.059> many<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.569> the<00:01:01.659> people<00:01:01.899> in
