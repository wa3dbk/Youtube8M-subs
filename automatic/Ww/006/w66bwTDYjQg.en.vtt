00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.650
 Y 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 ale as they are I am Nancy and today they 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.400
 I'm going to show you how I made this shirt 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.469
 I have, I was and I feel 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 absolutely no money is fine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.150
 in sauber because I'm addicted to sandler and 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.220
 everyone has their pineapple shirt 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 in you maybe I have the kilo too 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 so I looked for different ways of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
 do it myself but all day cool 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 What I found was with transfer paper vos 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 transfer paper that the truth does not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.879
 I have no idea everything is achieved here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.769
 Bogota and I thought that if to do my 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.750
 shirt or want who knows where 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.520
 get a paper and who knows how much 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.380
 slope and collection print an image 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.660
 super expensive because it has to be the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.219
 excellent quality better I go to a center 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 commercial that simply buy the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.000
 shirt but that was not the idea and if 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 something I have learned in my life is that the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 nail polish stain absolutely 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 everything and does not fall off the clothes and as they have given 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.789
 the bad has something good then I gave myself 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 he realized that it was a very good option for 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.960
 make my shirt so if you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.809
 interesting to see how this 5 challenge me 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.640
 pineapple then you stay watching the future and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 The first thing you will need is a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 shirt I recommend you to be white 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 and as you can see here I have on a paper 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 the figure of the pineapple in which the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.730
 description 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.710
 berlin this figurine 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.780
 Now I'm going to put the paper inside the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.580
 first shirt to trace the pineapple and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.290
 second to prevent the enamel from 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.620
 go to transfer to the back of your 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.620
 T shirt 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.820
 As you can see in the image we are going to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.800
 start tracing the dark parts of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.230
 the pineapple and for this you can use enamel 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.330
 coffee in orange or copper and we're going to do 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.460
 a few dots in the middle of the pictures 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.460
 to simulate the spines of the pineapple 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 then with yellow enamel let's go 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 fill in all the squares 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.820
 finally I'm going to take green glaze and 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.590
 you are going to trace the leaves of the pineapple this 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.360
 It may take a little time depending on 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.870
 how many details have the figure that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.870
 you have chosen 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.710
 when you have finished the first sketch 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.720
 start filling I wanted to do with 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.550
 rustic finish so how can you see 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 here in the image I am leaving spaces 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.800
 whites that serve to create effects of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800
 brightness 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 I wanted to add some lines with 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.660
 green light to create the illusion of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.340
 shadows and ready when you're finished 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.340
 you will have something like this 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.040
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.590

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.420
 this shirt when washing it so you 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.860
 avoid problems better do it in a 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.200
 shirt that you do not like anymore 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.240
 have you thought about voting and in this way you 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.520
 you give a different touch and you can use it 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.350
 for a longer time if you liked it 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.720
