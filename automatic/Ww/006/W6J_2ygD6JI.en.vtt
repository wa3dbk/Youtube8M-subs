is<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.109> processor<00:00:19.830> does<00:00:20.670> not<00:00:20.880> include

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
is that this processor does not include

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.820 
is that this processor does not include
a<00:00:21.210> heatsink<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.490> previous

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
a heatsink so like some previous

a heatsink so like some previous
processors<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> past<00:00:26.340> although<00:00:26.789> it's

processors in the past although it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630 
processors in the past although it's
never<00:00:27.029> been<00:00:27.240> done<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.539> Intel<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.920> CPU

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640

assumes<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> get-go<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.550> are

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
assumes from the get-go that you are

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.470 
assumes from the get-go that you are
going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.149> using<00:00:33.540> aftermarket<00:00:34.170> cooling

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
going to be using aftermarket cooling

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.209 
going to be using aftermarket cooling
however<00:00:36.480> Intel<00:00:37.079> does<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.710> cooling<00:00:37.980> options

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
however Intel does have cooling options

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.680 
however Intel does have cooling options
available<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.910> actually<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> two

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
available they actually have two

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
available they actually have two
different<00:00:39.719> cooling<00:00:40.260> options<00:00:40.500> available<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
different cooling options available that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
different cooling options available that
you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.579> buy<00:00:41.760> separately<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.530> an

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you can buy separately and that is an

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.830 
you can buy separately and that is an
air<00:00:44.070> cooling<00:00:44.460> heatsink<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.719> buy

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
air cooling heatsink which you can buy

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
air cooling heatsink which you can buy
okay<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.010> go

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
okay there you go

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
okay there you go
you're<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> pretty<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.480> what

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you're pretty that this pretty much what

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270 
you're pretty that this pretty much what
used<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> come<00:00:49.320> included<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> extreme

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
used to come included with the extreme

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
used to come included with the extreme
editions<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:52.050> buy<00:00:52.410> their

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
editions and then you can also buy their

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
editions and then you can also buy their
water<00:00:52.890> cooler<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.610> used<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> previous

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
water cooler which we used in a previous

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
water cooler which we used in a previous
video<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:55.020> installed<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> case<00:00:55.680> right

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
video and is installed in the case right

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.810 
video and is installed in the case right
now<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> hard<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.730> me

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now it's going to be kind of hard for me

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.779 
now it's going to be kind of hard for me
to<00:00:56.910> drag<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.680> find<00:00:58.789> inside

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to drag it out so what do we find inside

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.900 
to drag it out so what do we find inside
the<00:01:00.120> actual<00:01:00.510> box<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:02.100> even<00:01:02.370> less<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.820> an

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the actual box I have even less of an

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
the actual box I have even less of an
excuse<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.629> an<00:01:03.750> unboxing<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.290> a

three year warranty tell you about Intel

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.800 
three year warranty tell you about Intel
hyper-threading<00:01:26.970> technology<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
hyper-threading technology and

hyper-threading technology and
virtualization<00:01:28.320> technology<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> has

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
virtualization technology and this has

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
virtualization technology and this has
pretty<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.960> Intel<00:01:31.290> technology

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pretty much all of the Intel technology

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
pretty much all of the Intel technology
because<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> extreme<00:01:33.030> edition<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
because this is the extreme edition this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.249 
because this is the extreme edition this
is<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> cream<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> crop<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
is the cream of the crop and it is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.149 
is the cream of the crop and it is
expensive<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.970> LGA<00:01:39.479> 2011<00:01:39.770> CPU<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> very

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
expensive so an LGA 2011 CPU is very

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
expensive so an LGA 2011 CPU is very
large<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.820> has<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.780> thousand<00:01:43.439> zero<00:01:44.130> hundred

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
large it has two thousand zero hundred

while slick takes a very close look at
really<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.670> booklet<00:02:03.630> you've<00:02:04.110> got<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> be

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
really the booklet you've got to be

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
really the booklet you've got to be
kidding<00:02:04.710> me<00:02:04.740> okay<00:02:05.579> oh<00:02:05.729> he<00:02:06.090> says<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.270> was

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
kidding me okay oh he says he was

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.150 
kidding me okay oh he says he was
looking<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> CPU<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.740> fine

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
looking at the CPU all right fine

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.430 
looking at the CPU all right fine
okay<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.390> an<00:02:09.569> LGA<00:02:10.400> 1155<00:02:11.400> CPU<00:02:12.290> then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
okay so this is an LGA 1155 CPU then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.850 
okay so this is an LGA 1155 CPU then
is<00:02:13.620> an<00:02:13.740> LGA<00:02:14.070> 1366<00:02:14.550> CPU<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> therefore<00:02:16.560> scale

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
is an LGA 1366 CPU and therefore scale

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.820 
is an LGA 1366 CPU and therefore scale
next<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.460> them<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.850> your<00:02:18.060> LGA<00:02:18.390> 2011<00:02:18.560> CPU<00:02:19.560> so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
next to them is your LGA 2011 CPU so

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.430 
next to them is your LGA 2011 CPU so
basically<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.850> beast<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:22.110> from

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
basically it is a beast and here from

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.520 
basically it is a beast and here from
AMD<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.100> their<00:02:23.550> am3+<00:02:24.150> socket<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.350> kind

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
AMD is their am3+ socket so you can kind

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.970 
AMD is their am3+ socket so you can kind
of<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.770> how<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:25.980> compares<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.970> well<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.830> it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
of see how that compares as well so it's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
of see how that compares as well so it's
by<00:02:29.280> far<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.240> biggest<00:02:30.950> desktop<00:02:31.950> CPU<00:02:32.880> out<00:02:33.330> there

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
by far the biggest desktop CPU out there

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.900 
by far the biggest desktop CPU out there
in<00:02:34.080> terms<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.620> share<00:02:34.800> size<00:02:35.040> which<00:02:35.400> obviously

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
in terms of share size which obviously

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.580 
in terms of share size which obviously
equates<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.720> performance

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
equates to performance

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.700 
equates to performance
well<00:02:38.160> doesn't<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.510> case<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.870> does<00:02:40.050> so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
well doesn't but in this case it does so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.920 
well doesn't but in this case it does so
