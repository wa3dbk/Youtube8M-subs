00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.099
 hackintosh I have two days ago 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.690
 made to work 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 and yes that 's actually a windows me 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 windows box I also got here on the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.130
 second position windows 8 are running here 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.320
 Do you see the windows all the folders 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.330
 my programs in everything but i have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:36.120
 on my second partition sixx hd 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:38.270

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.350
 gigabyte ram from kingston quite normal 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 I have an assist mainboard 1 877 vl 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 and yes still on the geforce gtx 560 with 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.629
 1024 mb gddr5 ram so everything no 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.390
 problem with my own in one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 box priced quite cheap 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.109
 meanwhile leaving the box 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 I'd build you can write the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.030
 components in the description fits 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.299
 about 700 euro and yes is called mac 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 so I've stated quite well 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.299
 even with cinebench a few 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.860
 However, benchmarks often made room 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.060
 36 with my configuration so 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 really good with mine 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 graphics card has nothing to complain about 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.659
 normal full hd screen with hdmi 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.329
 everything is going very well hosts 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:34.770
 then it does not work around so now 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.890
 I also have quite normal with app store 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.070
 in all this is not a fake that works 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.070
 really 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.039
 of course I have this again 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.250
 for screen mode the new Bishop 3 too 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.880
 no problem has only until the loading her 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.609
 Look very normal mac app store is running 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 I already have all the purchases 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:03.929
 so only freeware is one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.640
 clipped together 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.640
 well that's not so important to me right now 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.680
 Of course I have everything out of them 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.370
 come here is especially since the usa was 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.950
 I already gamble on occasion 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.940
 surprisingly good on the a ligist 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.579
 shortcuts hereby f12 and everything is running 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.950
 I can not beat everything super 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.150
 is synonymous gamble no problem 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.410
 I'll just show it here with canoes 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.410
 track as donna anna bligh 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.670
 okay, believe me , if it is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.920
 it really does not mean that it really helps 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:09.270
 but i have no other game where on 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:22.110
 The mac also shows that you open 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:23.240
 gambling can be live in concert best 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.270
 demonstrate 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.270
 Just go mist it too 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.580
 so i can do it on the highest 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.470
 Resolving turkish graphic settings 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.080
 jerking like on a windows pc goes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:51.070
 work perfectly facebook i want 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.070
 demonstrate 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.400
 I hope it works smoothly too 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.290
 would not have to go record 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:10.820
 okay maybe you know record me 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:13.120
 but I actually have that too 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.120
 high 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.150
 Definitely see 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.210

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:52.330

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.240

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.900
 all internet no problem 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.530
 a plan does not buy you full in spite of how 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.360
 this works out 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.060
 if you are interested or maybe 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.820
 that's just how i show you this 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.729
 extra video as the culprit so me 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.610
 must be safe as I did before 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.870

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.870
