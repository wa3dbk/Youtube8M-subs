00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 serve the shaft today congratulations to the pies 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.309
 With this success, Amkar returns to the zone 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.070
 European Cup Amkar is gaining 23 points 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.889
 as much dynamo is left him white 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 depths and just will fight with 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.350
 leaders for the league zone chippers which 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 probably the dynamo especially based on 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.430
 of its composition 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.980
 should aim 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 [music] 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.899
 we saw the goals of Vasiliev and Belorukov and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.960
 happened the first half after that yet 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.210
 there were moments with amkar and look at mars 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.559
 could have ended very badly if 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.309
 would score 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.010
 for example Kolomeytsev and Pikuschak as was on 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.180
 halftime first in the first half 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.030
 played a great tension Kolomeytsev 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.690
 hit the target then exactly the same 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.420
 the moment already the beginning of the second half was and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.719
 Igor Picuschak and the most active part 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.719
 dynamo 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.479
 Alexander Kokorin he and beat on goal 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.159
 handed out transfers and in principle myself then 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.260
 probably not what can strengthened cover 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.790
 but partners 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.560
 it is not fully supported here 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.430
 Marien example what a cool attack 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.040
 dynamo turned you heel kokorina and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.009
 Voronin shot past the near corner later 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 still managed to score the dynamo did 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.050
 this is christian set 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.300
 [music] 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.370
 but apparently that in defense anyway 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.640
 White and blue had huge problems 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.300
 Douglas regularly with Anton Shunin 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 staged 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.830
 some kind of strange show brought 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.980
 the most dangerous moment and at your gate here 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.950
 there was a set of douglas all when paid 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.100
 penal and crystal are already empty 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 gate and guided here seemed that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 the dynamo will add a little more and even honey 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.040
 amkar but at that moment just amkar 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.200
 completely pushed the game away from their gates and into 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.970
 principle until the end of the match is already special 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 doubt win Amkar was not 21 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.590
 With this score, this meeting ends 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.380
 sent himself korra in defeat a match with 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.410
 the locomotive recovered disqualification 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.670
 words of the hour in the next class match 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.370
 new will be on the bench 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 statistics amazing up to 10 hits per 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 its own and the other two on target and those 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.220
 and others well amkar twice 40 struck 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.090
 and scored twice in sword possession 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.140
 have a dynamo advantage otherwise 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.330
 equality approximately but correlator only in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.890
 heads are much bigger than the USA 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.209
 21 ended this match with you for 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.209
 This meeting was watched by Pavel Splinters.
