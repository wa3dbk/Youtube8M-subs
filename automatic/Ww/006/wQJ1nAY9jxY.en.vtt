00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110 

ok<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> sagittal<00:00:02.100> slice<00:00:02.399> through<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
ok this is a sagittal slice through the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.539 
ok this is a sagittal slice through the
amygdala<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.160> hippocampus<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.430> I'm

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
amygdala and the hippocampus and I'm

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.690 
amygdala and the hippocampus and I'm
going<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.730> point<00:00:05.970> out<00:00:06.120> various<00:00:06.540> structures

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
going to point out various structures

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.430 
going to point out various structures
starting<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.150> cerebellum<00:00:09.750> here's<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
starting with the cerebellum here's the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.459 
starting with the cerebellum here's the
cerebellum<00:00:10.920> right<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.990> we<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
cerebellum right here and we have the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.630 
cerebellum right here and we have the
anterior<00:00:14.280> lobe<00:00:15.320> should<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
anterior lobe should be right here and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.750 
anterior lobe should be right here and
then<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> primary<00:00:19.050> fissure<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:19.740> would<00:00:20.609> be

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
then the primary fissure which would be

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
then the primary fissure which would be
right<00:00:20.939> there<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> see<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.230> bit

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
right there and we can see a little bit

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.830 
right there and we can see a little bit
of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> dentate<00:00:23.189> nucleus<00:00:24.980> right<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
of the dentate nucleus right here and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.150 
of the dentate nucleus right here and
then<00:00:27.840> I'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.439> off<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.769> pointing

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
then I'm going to start off by pointing

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
then I'm going to start off by pointing
out<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.519> hippocampus<00:00:30.330> which<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> right<00:00:31.050> here

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
out the hippocampus which is right here

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709 
out the hippocampus which is right here
central<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.130> memory<00:00:32.460> processes<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> part

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
central for memory processes and a part

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
central for memory processes and a part
of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> limbic<00:00:34.260> system<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:37.010> right<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.040> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of the limbic system and right here we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
of the limbic system and right here we
have<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> amygdala<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.710> also<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> part

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
have the amygdala which is also a part

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340 
have the amygdala which is also a part
of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> limbic<00:00:41.940> system<00:00:42.390> responsible<00:00:42.960> for

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the limbic system responsible for

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.940 
of the limbic system responsible for
emotions<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.550> fear<00:00:45.410> then<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
emotions and fear then we have the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.209 
emotions and fear then we have the
lateral<00:00:47.550> ventricles<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
lateral ventricles right here and

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
lateral ventricles right here and
choroid<00:00:50.219> plexus<00:00:50.300> which<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> responsible<00:00:51.870> for

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
choroid plexus which is responsible for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
choroid plexus which is responsible for
creating<00:00:52.680> CSF<00:00:53.870> right<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.090> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
creating CSF right here and this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.740 
creating CSF right here and this
structure<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.020> thalamus<00:00:58.859> and<00:01:02.510> just<00:01:03.510> above

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
structure is the thalamus and just above

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.380 
structure is the thalamus and just above
the<00:01:03.809> thalamus<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the thalamus we can see some of the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.440 
the thalamus we can see some of the
caudate<00:01:06.689> nucleus<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> basal<00:01:09.000> ganglia<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia and
this<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> tail<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.619> caudate

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this would be the tail of the caudate

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
this would be the tail of the caudate
and<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.030> start<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.229> head<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and we can start to see the head of the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.030 
and we can start to see the head of the
caudate<00:01:13.979> nucleus<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.470> as<00:01:16.470> its<00:01:16.710> form

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
caudate nucleus right here as its form

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210 
caudate nucleus right here as its form
it<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:18.259> now<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.530> big<00:01:19.830> structure

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it right here now this big structure

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.039 
it right here now this big structure
right<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> putamen<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
right here is the putamen which is a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
right here is the putamen which is a
part<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> basal<00:01:22.830> ganglia<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:25.220> we<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
part of the basal ganglia and we have

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640 
part of the basal ganglia and we have
the<00:01:26.700> Globus<00:01:27.270> pallidus<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the Globus pallidus right here we have

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.550 
the Globus pallidus right here we have
the<00:01:28.799> external<00:01:29.220> segment<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the external segment right here in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.850 
the external segment right here in the
internal<00:01:32.009> segment<00:01:33.409> right<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
internal segment right there which is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
internal segment right there which is
also<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.310> part<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> basal<00:01:36.240> ganglia<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:39.119> we

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
also a part of the basal ganglia then we

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.920 
also a part of the basal ganglia then we
have<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.840> internal<00:01:40.380> capsules<00:01:41.720> which<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
have the internal capsules which are a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.920 
have the internal capsules which are a
bundle<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.740> ascending<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.729> descending

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
bundle of ascending and descending

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.340 
bundle of ascending and descending
fibers<00:01:46.310> right<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
fibers right here and we can see a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.220 
fibers right here and we can see a
little<00:01:49.619> bit<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.189> claustrum

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.550 

right<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:57.050> would<00:01:57.260> be<00:01:57.290> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
right there and this would be the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.740 
right there and this would be the
anterior<00:01:58.130> commissure<00:01:58.400> bundle<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.450> white

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
anterior commissure bundle of white

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.380 
anterior commissure bundle of white
fibers<00:02:00.680> axons<00:02:01.340> connecting<00:02:01.970> both<00:02:02.120> hemispheres

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
fibers axons connecting both hemispheres

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.240 
fibers axons connecting both hemispheres
and<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.810> looks<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.230> that's<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and it looks like that's about all the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.160 
and it looks like that's about all the
major<00:02:07.490> structures<00:02:08.330> I'm<00:02:08.570> going<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> point<00:02:09.020> out

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
major structures I'm going to point out

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.220 
major structures I'm going to point out
in<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.770> section
