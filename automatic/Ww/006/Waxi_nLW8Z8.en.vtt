hey<00:00:02.000> guys<00:00:04.480> I'm<00:00:05.480> trying<00:00:05.810> to<00:00:05.870> learn<00:00:05.990> how<00:00:06.049> to<00:00:06.520> make

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
hey guys I'm trying to learn how to make

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.580 
hey guys I'm trying to learn how to make
these<00:00:07.730> t<00:00:08.029> flip-flops<00:00:09.519> so<00:00:10.519> I<00:00:10.550> tried<00:00:10.910> to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
these t flip-flops so I tried to

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.870 
these t flip-flops so I tried to
consolidate<00:00:12.590> a<00:00:12.620> little<00:00:12.980> bit<00:00:13.190> on<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:13.670> left

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
consolidate a little bit on the left

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.730 
consolidate a little bit on the left
there<00:00:14.090> is<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.360> standard<00:00:14.750> teeth<00:00:15.080> flip-flop

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
there is the standard teeth flip-flop

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.700 
there is the standard teeth flip-flop
and<00:00:16.150> on<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.300> right<00:00:17.509> is<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:18.019> one<00:00:18.199> I<00:00:18.230> came<00:00:18.529> up

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
and on the right is the one I came up

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.669 
and on the right is the one I came up
with<00:00:19.599> on<00:00:20.599> the<00:00:20.749> left<00:00:20.989> here<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:23.810> your<00:00:23.960> input

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
with on the left here it's your input

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.519 
with on the left here it's your input
coming<00:00:24.979> in<00:00:25.189> here<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:25.960> then<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.109> goes<00:00:27.259> to<00:00:27.319> a

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
coming in here and then it goes to a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.999 
coming in here and then it goes to a
couple<00:00:27.859> of<00:00:28.300> loops<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.689> three<00:00:30.169> torches<00:00:30.589> each<00:00:30.800> I

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
couple of loops of three torches each I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.700 
couple of loops of three torches each I
guess<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.489> that<00:00:32.109> too<00:00:33.109> in<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.320> middle<00:00:33.559> there

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
guess and that too in the middle there

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.770 
guess and that too in the middle there
they<00:00:33.859> kind<00:00:34.039> of<00:00:34.269> cancel<00:00:35.269> each<00:00:35.329> other<00:00:35.480> out<00:00:35.629> and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
they kind of cancel each other out and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.950 
they kind of cancel each other out and
then<00:00:36.019> it<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.280> outfit<00:00:37.670> their<00:00:37.960> online

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
then it it's the outfit their online

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.410 
then it it's the outfit their online
I've<00:00:39.530> used<00:00:39.679> this<00:00:39.890> little<00:00:40.879> circuit<00:00:41.210> here<00:00:41.300> on

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
I've used this little circuit here on

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.970 
I've used this little circuit here on
the<00:00:41.510> left<00:00:41.780> that's<00:00:42.350> an<00:00:42.980> RS<00:00:43.250> nor<00:00:43.399> latch<00:00:43.600> with<00:00:44.600> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
the left that's an RS nor latch with a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.860 
the left that's an RS nor latch with a
repeater<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.039> there<00:00:46.160> that<00:00:46.339> acts<00:00:46.910> like<00:00:46.999> a<00:00:47.120> quick

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
repeater in there that acts like a quick

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.229 
repeater in there that acts like a quick
flipper<00:00:48.350> they<00:00:49.129> use<00:00:49.249> that<00:00:49.429> for<00:00:49.609> my<00:00:49.699> door<00:00:49.910> on<00:00:50.120> my

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
flipper they use that for my door on my

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.189 
flipper they use that for my door on my
super<00:00:50.570> booster<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.159> inputs<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.879> on<00:00:53.359> are

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
super booster so that inputs the on are

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.290 
super booster so that inputs the on are
the<00:00:54.379> off<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.800> signal<00:00:55.339> into<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.730> other<00:00:55.879> three

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the off on signal into the other three

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.779 
the off on signal into the other three
are<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.839> two<00:00:57.350> loops<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.949> three<00:00:58.190> torches<00:00:58.489> each

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
are the two loops of three torches each

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.290 
are the two loops of three torches each
and<00:00:59.769> the<00:01:00.769> one<00:01:00.920> side<00:01:01.129> goes<00:01:01.370> into<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:01.730> loop

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
and the one side goes into this loop

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.570 
and the one side goes into this loop
over<00:01:02.539> here<00:01:02.690> one<00:01:02.899> torch<00:01:03.140> there<00:01:03.379> one<00:01:04.129> torch

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
over here one torch there one torch

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.460 
over here one torch there one torch
there<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.329> then<00:01:05.689> let's<00:01:05.899> torch<00:01:06.140> right<00:01:06.380> in

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
there and then let's torch right in

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.190 
there and then let's torch right in
front<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.770> us<00:01:06.920> that's<00:01:07.759> a<00:01:07.909> loop<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.270> three<00:01:08.630> they

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
front of us that's a loop of three they

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.330 
front of us that's a loop of three they
cancel<00:01:09.799> each<00:01:09.860> other<00:01:10.040> out<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:10.899> then<00:01:15.310> over<00:01:16.310> on

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
cancel each other out and then over on

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.440 
cancel each other out and then over on
the<00:01:16.610> other<00:01:16.640> side<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:18.170> same<00:01:18.439> on<00:01:18.860> off<00:01:19.219> on<00:01:19.520> off<00:01:19.759> on

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the other side the same on off on off on

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.749 
the other side the same on off on off on
off<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.939> signal<00:01:23.049> comes<00:01:24.049> over<00:01:24.409> here<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:25.040> this

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
off on signal comes over here to this

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.450 
off on signal comes over here to this
other<00:01:25.969> loop<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.360> three<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.469> there's<00:01:28.070> one<00:01:28.250> down

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
other loop of three and there's one down

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.429 
other loop of three and there's one down
there<00:01:28.759> as<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.149> first<00:01:29.450> one<00:01:29.719> and<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:31.070> turns<00:01:31.369> off

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
there as the first one and it turns off

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.179 
there as the first one and it turns off
the<00:01:33.439> wrong<00:01:33.829> up<00:01:34.250> there<00:01:34.610> on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.119> second<00:01:35.630> block

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
the wrong up there on the second block

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.770 
the wrong up there on the second block
it<00:01:37.189> turns<00:01:37.460> off<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:38.210> right<00:01:38.450> in<00:01:38.539> front<00:01:38.719> of

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it turns off the one right in front of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.499 
it turns off the one right in front of
us<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:41.060> turns<00:01:41.329> off

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
us there this on and that one turns off

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.389 
us there this on and that one turns off
the<00:01:41.689> first<00:01:41.899> one<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.229> those<00:01:42.380> three<00:01:42.619> together

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
the first one so those three together

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.810 
the first one so those three together
and<00:01:43.909> turn<00:01:44.060> each<00:01:44.180> other<00:01:44.359> off<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.579> then<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:46.729> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
and turn each other off and then in the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.090 
and turn each other off and then in the
middle<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.450> its<00:01:47.780> second<00:01:48.350> torch<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.950> each

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
middle that its second torch of each

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.300 
middle that its second torch of each
loop<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:50.270> RS<00:01:50.630> nor<00:01:50.810> latch<00:01:51.189> using<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
loop is this RS nor latch using the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.450 
loop is this RS nor latch using the
vertical<00:01:52.549> design<00:01:53.090> from<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.479> wiki<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.460> they

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
vertical design from the wiki and they

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.020 
vertical design from the wiki and they
cancel<00:01:55.880> each<00:01:55.969> other<00:01:56.149> out<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
cancel each other out and then the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.399 
cancel each other out and then the
output<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:01.359> bottom<00:02:02.359> torch<00:02:02.810> there<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.320> the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
output is the bottom torch there on the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.669 
output is the bottom torch there on the
left<00:02:03.710> that's<00:02:04.009> your<00:02:04.280> your<00:02:05.240> normal<00:02:05.570> output<00:02:05.780> but

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
left that's your your normal output but

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.950 
left that's your your normal output but
there's<00:02:06.859> also<00:02:07.039> an<00:02:07.280> outfit<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:07.939> can<00:02:08.119> take

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
there's also an outfit that you can take

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.930 
there's also an outfit that you can take
on<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.350> top<00:02:10.220> torch<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.810> RS<00:02:12.110> nor<00:02:12.260> latch

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
on the top torch the RS nor latch

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.000 
on the top torch the RS nor latch
and<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:14.990> other<00:02:15.110> way<00:02:15.350> too<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.710> here's<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and go up the other way too so here's a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.199 
and go up the other way too so here's a
first<00:02:16.370> input<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:17.540> first<00:02:17.810> output<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.209> here's

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
first input but first output and here's

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.949 
first input but first output and here's
a<00:02:20.270> second<00:02:20.750> output<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.850> they're<00:02:23.510> opposite

a second output so they're opposite

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.309 
a second output so they're opposite
states<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.910> whichever<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.900> needed<00:02:27.080> to

states so whichever one you needed to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.199 
states so whichever one you needed to
use<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:27.860> foes<00:02:29.260> let's<00:02:30.260> go<00:02:30.730> run<00:02:31.730> through<00:02:32.060> one

not redstone experts I don't know if
I've<00:03:01.400> done<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:01.820> completely<00:03:02.239> right<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.540> like

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
I've done this completely right I like

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.890 
I've done this completely right I like
somebody<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.459> check<00:03:04.670> my<00:03:04.850> work<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.540> make<00:03:05.870> sure

somebody to check my work and make sure

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.550 
somebody to check my work and make sure
it's<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.410> property<00:03:07.040> flip-flop<00:03:08.320> but<00:03:09.320> if<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.530> is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
it's a property flip-flop but if it is

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.110 
it's a property flip-flop but if it is
it's<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.519> lot<00:03:11.209> smaller<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:12.140> not<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:13.040> little<00:03:14.000> bit

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
it's a lot smaller if not a little bit

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's a lot smaller if not a little bit
more<00:03:14.360> complicated<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.430> i<00:03:16.430> will<00:03:17.299> post<00:03:17.540> his

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
more complicated but i will post his

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.479 
more complicated but i will post his
redstone<00:03:18.769> simulator<00:03:19.370> schematic<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:21.489> maybe

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
redstone simulator schematic and maybe

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.330 
redstone simulator schematic and maybe
an<00:03:22.820> MCEdit<00:03:23.600> schematic<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.470> thing<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.220> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
an MCEdit schematic of this thing so you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.569 
an MCEdit schematic of this thing so you
guys<00:03:25.549> can<00:03:25.850> look<00:03:26.120> at<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.900> let<00:03:27.680> me<00:03:27.890> know<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.310> I

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
guys can look at it and let me know if I

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.440 
guys can look at it and let me know if I
got<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.239> got<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.680> size<00:03:33.980> is

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
got what I think I got this size is

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.490 
got what I think I got this size is
considerably<00:03:35.450> smaller<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.810> here<00:03:39.140> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
considerably smaller it's so here the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.580 
considerably smaller it's so here the
the<00:03:40.100> one<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.519> wiki<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:42.100> seven<00:03:43.100> by<00:03:43.340> nine

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
the one on the wiki is seven by nine

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.949 
the one on the wiki is seven by nine
meters<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:47.390> there's<00:03:47.780> two<00:03:48.320> blocks<00:03:48.739> high<00:03:49.190> and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
meters and there's two blocks high and

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.840 
meters and there's two blocks high and
minus<00:03:50.959> 9<00:03:51.440> by<00:03:51.739> 4<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:54.440> wick<00:03:54.620> uses<00:03:55.040> 63<00:03:55.610> square

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
minus 9 by 4 so the wick uses 63 square

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.750 
minus 9 by 4 so the wick uses 63 square
meters<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.570> got<00:03:56.750> 36<00:03:57.320> square<00:03:57.560> meters<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.280> not

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
meters and I got 36 square meters so not

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.050 
meters and I got 36 square meters so not
quite<00:03:58.970> half<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.959> small<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.470> do<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.519> one<00:04:01.549> extra

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
quite half a small I do have one extra

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.390 
quite half a small I do have one extra
block<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:02.750> height<00:04:03.519> yeah<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.950> still<00:04:07.160> got

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
block and height yeah so but I still got

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.199 
block and height yeah so but I still got
less<00:04:08.060> volume<00:04:08.420> than<00:04:08.690> though<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.459> wiki<00:04:10.790> but

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
less volume than though in the wiki but

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.620 
less volume than though in the wiki but
if<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.620> look<00:04:12.799> at<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.130> one<00:04:13.549> block<00:04:13.910> over<00:04:14.180> on

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
if you look at that one block over on

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.870 
if you look at that one block over on
the<00:04:14.750> right<00:04:14.930> side<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.380> top<00:04:15.620> lock<00:04:15.859> there<00:04:16.190> that's

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
the right side the top lock there that's

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.000 
the right side the top lock there that's
actually<00:04:17.269> four<00:04:17.630> blocks<00:04:17.959> high<00:04:18.229> that's<00:04:18.739> not

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
actually four blocks high that's not

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.009 
actually four blocks high that's not
doing<00:04:19.459> anything<00:04:19.700> other<00:04:20.060> than<00:04:20.390> blocking<00:04:20.720> a

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
doing anything other than blocking a

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.090 
doing anything other than blocking a
signal<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:23.530> if<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.770> get<00:04:25.010> real

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
signal so if you go get real

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.590 
signal so if you go get real
all<00:04:26.340> about<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:26.790> suppose<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:27.210> could<00:04:27.330> say

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
all about it I suppose you could say

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.570 
all about it I suppose you could say
it's<00:04:27.720> four<00:04:27.990> blocks<00:04:28.440> higher<00:04:28.800> but<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.400> could

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
it's four blocks higher but that could

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.740 
it's four blocks higher but that could
be<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:31.850> well<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.910> guess<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.090> guess<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.600> would<00:04:33.720> be

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
be the well I guess I guess it would be

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.940 
be the well I guess I guess it would be
four<00:04:34.050> blocks<00:04:34.260> hi<00:04:34.440> guys<00:04:34.620> i<00:04:34.650> get<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.010> does<00:04:35.460> the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
four blocks hi guys i get that does the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.560 
four blocks hi guys i get that does the
desk<00:04:37.950> there<00:04:38.130> too<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.640> i'll<00:04:39.030> take<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.330> back

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
desk there too so i'll take that back

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.230 
desk there too so i'll take that back
it's<00:04:39.780> four<00:04:39.990> blocks<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.700> so<00:04:41.700> it's<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.000> little<00:04:42.120> bit

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
it's four blocks I so it's a little bit

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's four blocks I so it's a little bit
more<00:04:42.570> volume<00:04:42.870> then<00:04:43.350> if<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.430> can't<00:04:44.910> talk<00:04:45.270> that

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
more volume then if you can't talk that

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.970 
more volume then if you can't talk that
out<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:46.550> 126<00:04:47.550> cubic<00:04:48.300> meters<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.470> wiki

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
out it's 126 cubic meters for the wiki

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.770 
out it's 126 cubic meters for the wiki
and<00:04:50.220> mines<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.610> 944<00:04:51.510> cubic<00:04:51.990> meters<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:54.480> it's

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
and mines it 944 cubic meters so it's

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.920 
and mines it 944 cubic meters so it's
less<00:04:55.200> an<00:04:55.530> area<00:04:56.250> slightly<00:04:57.150> more<00:04:57.510> in<00:04:57.600> volume

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
less an area slightly more in volume

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.320 
less an area slightly more in volume
only<00:04:58.170> because<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.530> one<00:04:58.880> little<00:04:59.880> area<00:05:00.150> right

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
only because that one little area right

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.750 
only because that one little area right
there<00:05:00.540> probably<00:05:01.230> could<00:05:01.380> squash<00:05:02.220> that<00:05:02.490> end

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
there probably could squash that end
