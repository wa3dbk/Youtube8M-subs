00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659 

our<00:00:00.659> potato<00:00:01.170> plants<00:00:01.770> have<00:00:01.920> put<00:00:02.100> on<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.280> good

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
our potato plants have put on a good

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.970 
our potato plants have put on a good
amount<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:03.090> growth<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.810> they're<00:00:04.560> ready<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.859> be

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
amount of growth and they're ready to be

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.210 
amount of growth and they're ready to be
healed<00:00:05.549> hilling<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.569> simply<00:00:06.990> pulling<00:00:07.319> soil<00:00:07.950> up

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
healed hilling is simply pulling soil up

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.509 
healed hilling is simply pulling soil up
around<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.059> stems<00:00:09.570> as<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.500> plants<00:00:10.860> elongate

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
around the stems as the plants elongate

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.959 
around the stems as the plants elongate
and<00:00:11.759> what<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.420> does<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.960> create<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.530> ideal

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
and what this does is create an ideal

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
and what this does is create an ideal
environment<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.030> tuber<00:00:15.660> production<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
environment for tuber production the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
environment for tuber production the
loose<00:00:17.250> soil<00:00:17.640> that's<00:00:18.029> pulled<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.480> around<00:00:18.630> there

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
loose soil that's pulled up around there

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.429 
loose soil that's pulled up around there
allows<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.010> tubers<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.430> expand<00:00:21.090> easily<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
allows the tubers to expand easily the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.150 
allows the tubers to expand easily the
soil<00:00:22.710> also<00:00:23.460> creates<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.810> area<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.590> tuber

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
soil also creates more area for tuber

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.230 
soil also creates more area for tuber
production<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:27.029> we're<00:00:27.150> gonna

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
production because we're gonna

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.050 
production because we're gonna
continually<00:00:28.140> add<00:00:28.380> soil<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.699> end<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.939> with

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
continually add soil on and end up with

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.280 
continually add soil on and end up with
a<00:00:30.090> large<00:00:30.390> mound<00:00:30.869> around<00:00:31.289> our<00:00:31.470> plants<00:00:31.980> also

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
a large mound around our plants also

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
a large mound around our plants also
hilling<00:00:34.290> soil<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.829> around<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> plant<00:00:35.460> will

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
hilling soil up around the plant will

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270 
hilling soil up around the plant will
protect<00:00:36.180> those<00:00:36.660> developing<00:00:37.290> tubers<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
protect those developing tubers from the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.810 
protect those developing tubers from the
sunlight

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
sunlight

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.600 
sunlight
when<00:00:39.420> tubers<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:40.020> exposed<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> sunlight<00:00:41.100> they

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
when tubers are exposed to sunlight they

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.479 
when tubers are exposed to sunlight they
produce<00:00:42.140> toxins<00:00:43.140> called<00:00:43.440> glyco<00:00:43.770> alkaloids

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
produce toxins called glyco alkaloids

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.209 
produce toxins called glyco alkaloids
and<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.600> many<00:00:46.140> people<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.590> allergic<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and these many people are allergic to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580 
and these many people are allergic to
but<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.420> they're<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.750> simply<00:00:49.079> eaten<00:00:49.469> in

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
but also if they're just simply eaten in

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
but also if they're just simply eaten in
large<00:00:49.829> quantities<00:00:50.489> they<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:51.030> cause<00:00:51.239> illness

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
large quantities they can cause illness

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
large quantities they can cause illness
so<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> always<00:00:53.070> protect<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.940> tubers

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so we want to always protect our tubers

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.410 
so we want to always protect our tubers
from<00:00:54.449> direct<00:00:54.960> sunlight<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> includes

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
from direct sunlight and that includes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
from direct sunlight and that includes
potatoes<00:00:57.420> after<00:00:58.109> they've<00:00:58.289> been<00:00:58.469> harvested<00:00:59.100> as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
potatoes after they've been harvested as

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
potatoes after they've been harvested as
well<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.699> those<00:00:59.940> growing<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> ground<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
well as those growing in the ground so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
well as those growing in the ground so
our<00:01:01.859> plants<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.430> ready<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.879> heal<00:01:03.149> when

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
our plants are ready to heal when

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
our plants are ready to heal when
they're<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.719> 8<00:01:03.989> inches<00:01:04.290> tall<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
they're about 8 inches tall and if you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.380 
they're about 8 inches tall and if you
have<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.450> plants<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.220> rows<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.610> bare<00:01:08.939> soil

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have your plants in rows with bare soil

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
have your plants in rows with bare soil
around<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> could<00:01:10.140> simply<00:01:10.590> use<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.830> hole

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
around them you could simply use a hole

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
around them you could simply use a hole
and<00:01:11.670> pull<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.049> soil<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.740> around<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.310> plant

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and pull that soil up around your plant

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.149 
and pull that soil up around your plant
but<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.080> intensive<00:01:16.680> bed<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
but because I'm in an intensive bed and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.910 
but because I'm in an intensive bed and
my<00:01:17.310> rows<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.880> mulched<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.900> bringing<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.619> some

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
my rows are mulched I'm bringing in some

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
my rows are mulched I'm bringing in some
compost<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.049> shovel<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
compost and I'm gonna just shovel that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.100 
compost and I'm gonna just shovel that
around<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.759> plants<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> also<00:01:25.770> use<00:01:26.280> straw

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
around my plants you can also use straw

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.920 
around my plants you can also use straw
or<00:01:28.110> other<00:01:28.320> types<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.860> mulch<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:30.299> idea<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
or other types of mulch the idea is to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
or other types of mulch the idea is to
find<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.650> material<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.549> nice<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> loose

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
find a material that's nice and loose

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.179 
find a material that's nice and loose
and<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:35.100> cover<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.670> stems<00:01:36.259> at<00:01:37.259> least<00:01:37.500> halfway

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and to cover the stems at least halfway

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
and to cover the stems at least halfway
and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> nice<00:01:39.780> mound

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and so you can see we have a nice mound

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
and so you can see we have a nice mound
some<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> leaves<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:41.700> still<00:01:41.970> exposed<00:01:42.450> at

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
some of the leaves are still exposed at

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
some of the leaves are still exposed at
the<00:01:42.780> top<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.310> continue<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> grow

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the top and that will continue to grow

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.499 
the top and that will continue to grow
in<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.320> few<00:01:46.619> weeks<00:01:46.860> our<00:01:47.220> plants<00:01:47.939> gonna<00:01:48.119> grow<00:01:48.329> up

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
in a few weeks our plants gonna grow up

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.440 
in a few weeks our plants gonna grow up
another<00:01:49.170> foot<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.250> above<00:01:50.490> our<00:01:50.790> mound<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
another foot or so above our mound and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
another foot or so above our mound and
we're<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> heal<00:01:52.380> again<00:01:52.530> we'll

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
we're going to want to heal again we'll

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
we're going to want to heal again we'll
heal<00:01:53.250> after<00:01:53.750> about<00:01:54.750> three<00:01:55.200> weeks<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> then

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
heal after about three weeks and then

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
heal after about three weeks and then
again<00:01:56.460> two<00:01:56.759> weeks<00:01:56.790> after<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> each<00:01:57.780> time

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
again two weeks after that each time

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.760 
again two weeks after that each time
adding<00:01:58.710> 3<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.189> 4<00:01:59.549> inches<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.960> our<00:02:00.990> soil<00:02:01.469> mound

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
adding 3 or 4 inches to our soil mound

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.639 
adding 3 or 4 inches to our soil mound
around<00:02:02.549> our<00:02:02.729> plants<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.420> want<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> continue<00:02:04.469> to
