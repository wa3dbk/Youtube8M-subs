00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.979
 total repair extreme series from evita 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 this one acts strong parry for the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.400
 active ingredients penetrate to the center of the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.689
 hair before 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.030
 The hair is so inside 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.759
 stabilized and protected against 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 future strains with shampoo and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.939
 Flushing will thus damage your hair 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.939

 he already has I show you this now 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.540
 professional handling with brush and 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.460
 Foehn for a school of endnotes are 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.770
 brushes with different bristles in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 different lengths from ideal 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 Lange has only harlingen at first and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.200
 tips must then only the approach of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.300
 should you at medium heat stage in the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 distance of 25 centimeters 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.140
 This will leave more moisture in the hsh 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.729
 less damaged and gets more 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.180
 Last of all, styling 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.320
 creativity asked hair ties clinging 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.229
 varying at different places 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.910
 to fix as expensive as you see 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.170
 last moment before application 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.670
 It is particularly effective when it melts together 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.360
 just spread in the tips and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.360
