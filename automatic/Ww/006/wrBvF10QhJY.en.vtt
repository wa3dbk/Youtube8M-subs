more<00:00:19.700> awkward<00:00:19.849> one<00:00:20.539> of<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.750> things<00:00:20.990> to

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
more awkward one of the things to

cluster of buds on the top and you can
just<00:00:34.430> see<00:00:34.790> one<00:00:35.150> there<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.260> another<00:00:37.100> one<00:00:37.309> just

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
just see one there and another one just

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.310 
just see one there and another one just
here<00:00:38.269> okay

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
here okay

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.279

leaves<00:00:39.589> are<00:00:40.210> fairly<00:00:41.210> indistinct<00:00:41.780> I<00:00:41.870> guess<00:00:42.079> but

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
leaves are fairly indistinct I guess but

leaves are fairly indistinct I guess but
they're<00:00:42.440> serrated<00:00:42.920> they<00:00:43.039> tend<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.309> have<00:00:43.430> this

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579

nib point on them this particular sample
I<00:00:47.390> think<00:00:47.690> has<00:00:48.160> got<00:00:49.160> one<00:00:49.370> or<00:00:49.489> two<00:00:49.520> cherries

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
I think has got one or two cherries

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.049 
I think has got one or two cherries
still<00:00:50.449> left<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:50.840> it<00:00:51.050> or<00:00:51.829> at<00:00:51.949> least<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.340> fruits

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
still left on it or at least the fruits

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.420 
still left on it or at least the fruits
the<00:00:53.300> stones<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.989> cherry<00:00:54.260> are<00:00:54.949> still<00:00:55.219> left

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the stones of the cherry are still left

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.369 
the stones of the cherry are still left
cherries<00:00:56.359> have<00:00:56.420> been<00:00:56.570> eaten<00:00:56.809> by<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:56.960> birds<00:00:57.260> at

cherries have been eaten by the birds at

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.860 
cherries have been eaten by the birds at
this<00:00:57.530> time<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.890> year<00:00:57.920> latest<00:00:58.820> summer<00:00:59.059> but

this time of year latest summer but

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.959 
this time of year latest summer but
perhaps<00:01:00.530> their<00:01:00.890> characteristic<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.730> tune

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
perhaps their characteristic to tune

as these short secondary stems that
we've<00:01:06.680> seen<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.610> as<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.000> look<00:01:08.210> back<00:01:08.570> down<00:01:08.869> the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
we've seen is as you look back down the

horizontal banding pattern and a lot of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.870 
horizontal banding pattern and a lot of
people<00:01:18.500> are<00:01:18.619> familiar<00:01:19.009> with<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.490> matured

people are familiar with this on matured
cherry<00:01:20.509> trees<00:01:20.869> you'll<00:01:21.320> see<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:21.740> on<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.890> stem

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
cherry trees you'll see it on the stem

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.819 
cherry trees you'll see it on the stem
you'll<00:01:22.520> see<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:23.000> striped<00:01:23.869> banding<00:01:24.439> pattern

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
you'll see a striped banding pattern

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.310 
you'll see a striped banding pattern
horizontal<00:01:25.579> what<00:01:26.479> they<00:01:26.570> call<00:01:26.750> lenticular

horizontal what they call lenticular

wood as it gets older you go down the
tree<00:01:32.990> if<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.799> close-up<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.490> you'll

tree if we get a close-up of that you'll

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.310 
tree if we get a close-up of that you'll
be<00:01:34.759> able<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.000> see<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.270> beginnings<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.900> this

be able to see the beginnings of this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.429 
be able to see the beginnings of this

big positive attributes of cherry is

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.080 
big positive attributes of cherry is
it's<00:01:41.600> relatively<00:01:42.049> fast<00:01:42.439> growing<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.850> means

it's relatively fast growing that means

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.819 
it's relatively fast growing that means
you<00:01:44.210> can<00:01:44.360> produce<00:01:44.630> saw<00:01:44.869> logs<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:45.290> about<00:01:45.560> sort

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
you can produce saw logs in about sort

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.550 
you can produce saw logs in about sort
of<00:01:45.860> 40<00:01:46.369> maybe<00:01:46.549> 45<00:01:46.850> years<00:01:47.540> which<00:01:48.049> sounds<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.439> long
