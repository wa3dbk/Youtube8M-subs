00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you know like many Americans I think it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.090 
you know like many Americans I think it
was<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.279> initial<00:00:33.210> reaction<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.780> shock<00:00:34.100> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
was really initial reaction of shock I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.459 
was really initial reaction of shock I
think<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> Muslim<00:00:36.989> American

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
think that not just as a Muslim American

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.900 
think that not just as a Muslim American
but<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.950> any<00:00:38.879> American<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.910> apparent

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
but as any American it's really apparent

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.720 
but as any American it's really apparent
that<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.660> clear<00:00:43.079> violation<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that this is a clear violation of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.110 
that this is a clear violation of the
ban<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.230> proselytizing<00:00:46.230> by<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> US<00:00:47.700> Armed

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
ban on proselytizing by the US Armed

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.590 
ban on proselytizing by the US Armed
Forces<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.969> fact<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.539> think

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
Forces and so you know in fact I think

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
Forces and so you know in fact I think
it's<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.770> bit<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.640> shocking

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's probably a little bit more shocking

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.049 
it's probably a little bit more shocking
as<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> Christian<00:00:55.050> American<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
as a Christian American to see that you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.869 
as a Christian American to see that you
know<00:00:57.090> gun<00:00:58.020> scopes<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.829> being<00:00:59.219> inscripted

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
know gun scopes are being inscripted

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.840 
know gun scopes are being inscripted
with<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.590> references<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> book<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
killing and and I guess violence of any

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.359 
killing and and I guess violence of any
sort<00:01:08.610> should<00:01:08.880> never<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.860> endorsed<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.070> or

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that are in the field so it is promising

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.069 
that are in the field so it is promising
that<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:02.270> guess<00:02:04.520> action<00:02:05.520> has<00:02:05.909> been

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
that this I guess action has been

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
that this I guess action has been
quickly<00:02:07.079> rectified<00:02:07.530> both<00:02:08.489> by<00:02:08.789> our<00:02:09.390> government

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
quickly rectified both by our government

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.020 
quickly rectified both by our government
and<00:02:10.050> also<00:02:10.379> by<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> defense<00:02:11.190> contractor<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and also by the defense contractor I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
and also by the defense contractor I
think<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:12.900> speak<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
think what it does speak to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.990 
think what it does speak to
is<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:14.069> needs<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> lot<00:02:14.970> more

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
is there really needs to be a lot more

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.520 
is there really needs to be a lot more

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
inscription in a gun scope I think it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.920

you know it's actually really important
I<00:02:52.050> think<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.410> anything<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.400> government

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
I think in anything that the government

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.229 
I think in anything that the government
does<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.600> ensure<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.250> buys<00:02:56.820> by<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
does to ensure that it buys by the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.990 
does to ensure that it buys by the
Constitution<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.440> by<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.370> laws<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.610> this

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
Constitution and by the laws that this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
Constitution and by the laws that this
country<00:03:00.209> was<00:03:00.390> founded<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> don't<00:03:01.860> really

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
country was founded on so I don't really

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.680 
country was founded on so I don't really
think<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.580> political<00:03:02.850> correctness<00:03:03.390> issue

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
think it's a political correctness issue

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.380 
think it's a political correctness issue
i<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.380> an<00:03:05.190> American<00:03:05.760> issue<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.209> make

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
i think it's an American issue to make

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.770 
i think it's an American issue to make
