00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
made to be competitive so the theme of

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.910 
made to be competitive so the theme of
this<00:00:08.670> deck<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.450> use<00:00:09.660> both<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.500> mega

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
know the two mega monarch so that just

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490 
know the two mega monarch so that just
use<00:00:17.820> two<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> each<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:19.080> built<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> deck

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
use two of each and I built the deck

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.310 
use two of each and I built the deck
around<00:00:19.710> having<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.640> two<00:00:20.939> cards<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> then

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
around having these two cards in it then

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
around having these two cards in it then
I<00:00:22.529> cannot<00:00:22.859> take<00:00:23.010> him<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.300> stack

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
I cannot take him out because the stack

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
I cannot take him out because the stack
is<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.660> lot<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:24.990> efficient<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> don't<00:00:25.949> use

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160

with this deck lacks is actual monster

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.529 
with this deck lacks is actual monster
removal<00:06:12.830> so<00:06:13.520> that's<00:06:13.669> why<00:06:13.789> there's<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.240> triple

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
removal so that's why there's the triple

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.820 
removal so that's why there's the triple
Caius<00:06:14.840> because<00:06:15.199> Caius<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.759> best<00:06:17.030> monarch

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830

Caius because Caius is the best monarch
and<00:06:18.830> I<00:06:19.789> just<00:06:20.000> couldn't<00:06:20.210> play<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:21.550> pure<00:06:22.550> mega

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
and I just couldn't play a pure mega

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.089 
and I just couldn't play a pure mega
monarch<00:06:23.360> deck<00:06:23.599> I<00:06:23.810> had<00:06:23.990> ad<00:06:24.229> in<00:06:24.409> Caius<00:06:24.650> because

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
monarch deck I had ad in Caius because

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.649 
monarch deck I had ad in Caius because
there<00:06:25.250> was<00:06:25.370> just<00:06:25.520> no<00:06:25.639> way<00:06:25.759> to<00:06:25.819> destroy<00:06:26.210> actual

monsters<00:06:27.139> on<00:06:27.259> the<00:06:27.289> field<00:06:27.430> so<00:06:28.430> that's<00:06:28.550> why

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
monsters on the field so that's why

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.100 
monsters on the field so that's why
Caius<00:06:28.940> isn't<00:06:29.270> here<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.599> get<00:06:29.780> rid<00:06:29.930> of<00:06:29.990> their
