right<00:01:58.659> was<00:01:58.960> his<00:01:59.080> athleticism<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.040> he's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
right was his athleticism so he's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.250 
right was his athleticism so he's
certainly<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.060> big<00:02:01.270> time<00:02:01.479> factor<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:01.990> think<00:02:02.020> if

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
certainly a big time factor I think if

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.899 
certainly a big time factor I think if
they<00:02:02.350> had<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.560> Heisman<00:02:02.890> boat<00:02:03.070> today<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:03.790> he

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
they had the Heisman boat today if he

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.149 
they had the Heisman boat today if he
probably<00:02:04.150> win<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.600> outright<00:02:04.810> for<00:02:05.770> his<00:02:05.890> first

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.040 
probably win it outright for his first
two<00:02:06.280> weeks<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.610> season<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.210> obviously<00:02:07.900> all
