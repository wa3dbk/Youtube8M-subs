tutorial for you guys today I have a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.230 
tutorial for you guys today I have a
decimal<00:00:13.410> binary<00:00:13.980> counter<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.549> if<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> have

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
decimal binary counter and if you have

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
decimal binary counter and if you have
no<00:00:15.360> idea<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.289> what<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> binary

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
no idea what this is or what a binary

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.800 
no idea what this is or what a binary
counter<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.580> I'll<00:00:18.270> check<00:00:18.570> out<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
counter is I'll check out the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390 
counter is I'll check out the

hamsters video on binary but anyway this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.779 
hamsters video on binary but anyway this
is<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> simple<00:00:24.720> binary<00:00:24.990> counter<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.949> I'll

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
is just a simple binary counter and I'll

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.470 
is just a simple binary counter and I'll
go<00:00:27.000> ahead<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.300> reset<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.199> real<00:00:28.470> quick<00:00:29.480> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
go ahead and reset it real quick and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
go ahead and reset it real quick and
this<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.410> work<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> new<00:00:32.009> snapshot

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this will only work in the new snapshot

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
this will only work in the new snapshot
as<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.270> playing<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.600> 12<00:00:33.809> w<00:00:34.170> 30<00:00:34.440> b

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
as you can see I'm playing in 12 w 30 b

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.940 
as you can see I'm playing in 12 w 30 b
and<00:00:35.300> this<00:00:36.300> action<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.710> point

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and this action will work in one point

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.330 
and this action will work in one point
two<00:00:38.070> point<00:00:38.219> five<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.149> 0<00:00:39.450> &amp;<00:00:39.780> 2<00:00:39.809> access<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
two point five on the 0 &amp; 2 access but

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.330 
two point five on the 0 &amp; 2 access but
because<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.090> piston<00:00:42.480> fixes<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.110> 1.3<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
because of the piston fixes in 1.3 and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.860 
because of the piston fixes in 1.3 and
also<00:00:45.329> works<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.890> three<00:00:47.789> axis<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
also works on the one and three axis so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
also works on the one and three axis so
i'll<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.110> ahead<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.320> show<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.800> both<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.280> them

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
i'll go ahead and show you both of them

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
i'll go ahead and show you both of them
working<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> i'm<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.320> talking

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
working just so you know i'm not talking

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
working just so you know i'm not talking
on<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.340> ass<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.360> anyway<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.500> ahead<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
on my ass so anyway we go ahead and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.580 
on my ass so anyway we go ahead and
press<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> account<00:00:57.590> press

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
press it you can see it account press

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
press it you can see it account press
again<00:00:59.539> as<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> somewhat

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
again as you see and there is somewhat

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.710 
again as you see and there is somewhat
of a<00:01:02.489> delay<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.680> displays<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
of a delay to the displays and that is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.550 
of a delay to the displays and that is
because<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> way<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
because of the way that you have to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.179 
because of the way that you have to
power<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.210> 1.3<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.200> anyway<00:01:13.470> i'm<00:01:14.070> not

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
power these in 1.3 so anyway i'm not

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.320 
power these in 1.3 so anyway i'm not
going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.490> guys<00:01:14.670> suffer<00:01:14.939> through<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going to make you guys suffer through it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
going to make you guys suffer through it
but<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.080> working<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:17.400> i<00:01:17.520> come

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but you can see it's working if i come

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.590 
but you can see it's working if i come
over<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.979> press<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.820> see

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
over here and press this right here see

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
over here and press this right here see
it<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.259> works<00:01:23.600> no<00:01:24.600> mods<00:01:24.920> nothing<00:01:25.920> just

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

it also works no mods nothing just
playing<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.820> latest<00:01:27.390> snapshot<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.100> anyway

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
playing in the latest snapshot so anyway

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
playing in the latest snapshot so anyway
as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.000> counts<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.390> well<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
as you see that counts as well and the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
as you see that counts as well and the
reason<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.909> purple<00:01:33.420> line

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
reason you have to have this purple line

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
reason you have to have this purple line
the<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.460> instead<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.820> this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the way it is instead of like this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
the way it is instead of like this
purple<00:01:36.329> line<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.530> i<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:38.100> show<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
purple line is because i will show you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
purple line is because i will show you
if<00:01:38.909> i<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.240> ahead<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> press<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.350> here

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
if i go ahead and press this right here

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
if i go ahead and press this right here
you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.119> pushed<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> up

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you can see that they all pushed it up

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.200 
you can see that they all pushed it up
but<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.680> soon<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.250> i<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:44.880> pushed<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.649> they<00:01:46.649> all

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
but as soon as i got pushed up they all

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
but as soon as i got pushed up they all
all<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> Pistons<00:01:48.780> extend<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
all the Pistons extend it and that is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.630 
all the Pistons extend it and that is
because<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:52.110> latest<00:01:52.500> snapshot<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
because in the latest snapshot if you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.800 
because in the latest snapshot if you
take<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> block<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
take a block like so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.819 
take a block like so
and<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:58.790> push<00:01:59.119> power<00:01:59.899> into<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:02.680> if<00:02:03.680> you

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
and you push power into it and if you

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.740 
and you push power into it and if you
push<00:02:04.009> power<00:02:04.220> into<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.610> block<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.539> now

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
push power into the block it's now

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.870 
push power into the block it's now
powering<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.860> block<00:02:07.280> right<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:07.549> which

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
powering this block right here which

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.309 
powering this block right here which
powers<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> piston<00:02:08.690> head<00:02:08.840> which<00:02:09.020> powers<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
powers the piston head which powers the

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.589 
powers the piston head which powers the
piston<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:09.890> now<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:10.849> just<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.209> new<00:02:11.360> feature

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
piston and now that's just a new feature

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.470 
piston and now that's just a new feature
in<00:02:11.870> 1.3<00:02:12.319> we're<00:02:12.709> powering<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.610> piston<00:02:14.000> head<00:02:14.239> will

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
in 1.3 we're powering a piston head will

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.160 
in 1.3 we're powering a piston head will
actually<00:02:14.780> power<00:02:15.019> piston<00:02:15.890> itself<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.870> anyway

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
actually power piston itself so anyway

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.960 
actually power piston itself so anyway
that's<00:02:18.470> one<00:02:18.769> of<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.950> changes<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.550> Pistons

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
that's one of the changes to the Pistons

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.790 
that's one of the changes to the Pistons
so<00:02:20.239> that's<00:02:20.420> why<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.599> won't<00:02:20.870> work<00:02:21.080> because<00:02:21.590> as

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so that's why this won't work because as

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.860 
so that's why this won't work because as
you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.069> see<00:02:22.250> they're<00:02:22.430> all<00:02:22.550> extended<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.360> no

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you can see they're all extended and no

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.080 
you can see they're all extended and no
manner<00:02:24.080> yeah<00:02:24.800> no<00:02:25.069> matter<00:02:25.280> how<00:02:25.550> many<00:02:25.670> times<00:02:25.910> i

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
manner yeah no matter how many times i

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.190 
manner yeah no matter how many times i
press<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.450> button<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:28.130> will<00:02:28.190> not<00:02:28.989> move<00:02:29.989> any

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
press this button this will not move any

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.630 
press this button this will not move any
of<00:02:30.350> these<00:02:30.470> blocks<00:02:30.799> or<00:02:30.980> allow<00:02:31.130> them<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.459> move

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
of these blocks or allow them to move

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.870 
of these blocks or allow them to move
however<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.540> method<00:02:32.780> does<00:02:33.190> because<00:02:34.190> why<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
however this method does because why the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.789 
however this method does because why the
one<00:02:35.120> tick<00:02:35.330> pulse<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> being<00:02:35.959> emitted<00:02:36.170> this

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
one tick pulse is being emitted this

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.320 
one tick pulse is being emitted this
torch<00:02:37.190> which<00:02:37.370> powers<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.790> whole<00:02:37.940> line<00:02:38.120> is

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
torch which powers this whole line is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.330 
torch which powers this whole line is
being<00:02:38.540> turned<00:02:38.720> off<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.760> allows<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.890> piston

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
being turned off and allows the piston

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.050 
being turned off and allows the piston
to<00:02:43.750> retract<00:02:44.750> before<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:46.160> powers<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.730> again

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
to retract before it powers this again

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.100 
to retract before it powers this again
so<00:02:47.269> there's<00:02:47.569> actually<00:02:48.019> block<00:02:48.530> disc<00:02:48.860> distance

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
so there's actually block disc distance

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.650 
so there's actually block disc distance
also<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.170> want<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.069> put<00:02:52.250> redstone<00:02:52.940> repeaters

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
also you want to put redstone repeaters

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.680 
also you want to put redstone repeaters
here<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.560> put<00:02:54.769> redstone<00:02:55.239> dust<00:02:56.239> right

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
here if you put redstone dust right

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.690 
here if you put redstone dust right
there<00:02:56.959> you'll<00:02:57.560> actually<00:02:57.739> create<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.400> bud

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
there you'll actually create a bud

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.539 
there you'll actually create a bud
switch<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.829> don't<00:03:01.070> want<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.519> that

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
switch and you don't want to have that

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.660 
switch and you don't want to have that
for<00:03:02.329> your<00:03:02.660> creation<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.040> definitely<00:03:04.519> make

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
for your creation so definitely make

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.910 
for your creation so definitely make
sure<00:03:04.700> these<00:03:04.880> are<00:03:05.090> repeaters<00:03:05.390> as<00:03:05.660> well<00:03:05.920> it's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
sure these are repeaters as well it's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.080 
sure these are repeaters as well it's
pretty<00:03:07.070> simple<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.549> build<00:03:07.640> I'll<00:03:07.880> show<00:03:08.000> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
pretty simple to build I'll show you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.030 
pretty simple to build I'll show you
guys<00:03:08.209> how<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.420> build<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.840> real<00:03:08.989> quick<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.500> will

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
guys how to build it real quick I will

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.759 
guys how to build it real quick I will
start<00:03:10.280> off<00:03:10.400> with<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.609> red<00:03:11.109> label<00:03:12.109> layer<00:03:12.470> real

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
start off with the red label layer real

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
start off with the red label layer real
quick<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.000> you're<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.269> want<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.510> start

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
quick so you're going to want to start

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.569 
quick so you're going to want to start
make<00:03:15.109> two<00:03:15.350> blocks<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.069> center<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> two

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
make two blocks and the center the two

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.120 
make two blocks and the center the two
blocks<00:03:16.910> place<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.269> sticky<00:03:17.600> piston<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.260> place<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
blocks place a sticky piston and place a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.640 
blocks place a sticky piston and place a
block<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.430> top<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.910> sticky<00:03:20.180> piston<00:03:20.630> play<00:03:21.440> some

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
block on top of sticky piston play some

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.280 
block on top of sticky piston play some
dust<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:23.030> block<00:03:23.269> they<00:03:23.540> are<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> button

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
dust here and a block they are a button

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.120 
dust here and a block they are a button
there<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:25.190> repeater<00:03:25.549> here<00:03:26.769> just<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:27.889> so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
there and a repeater here just like so

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.830 
there and a repeater here just like so
make<00:03:28.370> sure<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.579> repeater<00:03:28.880> stays<00:03:29.239> on<00:03:29.420> one<00:03:29.600> tick

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
make sure the repeater stays on one tick

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.440 
make sure the repeater stays on one tick
then<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.680> replace<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.069> piston<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.730> space<00:03:32.060> fist

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
then you replace a piston a space fist

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.410 
then you replace a piston a space fist
in<00:03:32.630> space<00:03:32.959> piston<00:03:33.590> space<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:35.239> we're<00:03:35.329> going

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
in space piston space then we're going

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.759 
in space piston space then we're going
to<00:03:35.480> go<00:03:35.569> ahead<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.200> we're<00:03:36.319> going<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.470> put<00:03:36.590> down

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
to go ahead and we're going to put down

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.890 
to go ahead and we're going to put down
the<00:03:36.920> purple<00:03:37.250> layer<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.540> each<00:03:38.720> of

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
the purple layer like so on each of

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.809 
the purple layer like so on each of
these<00:03:38.989> purple<00:03:39.500> layers<00:03:39.709> you're<00:03:40.040> going<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.549> want

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
these purple layers you're going to want

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.370 
these purple layers you're going to want
to<00:03:40.970> put<00:03:41.359> a<00:03:42.700> repeater<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.030> then<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:45.049> top<00:03:45.319> of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
to put a repeater and then on top of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.039 
to put a repeater and then on top of
each<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.190> these<00:03:46.609> you're<00:03:47.090> going<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.630> want<00:03:47.930> to

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
each of these you're going to want to

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.460 
each of these you're going to want to
put<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.590> symbol<00:03:49.040> just<00:03:49.850> like<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:50.690> now

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
put the symbol just like so and so now

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.830 
put the symbol just like so and so now
this<00:03:51.620> will<00:03:51.859> count<00:03:52.579> for<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.329> find<00:03:53.569> on<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this will count for you just find on a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.979 
this will count for you just find on a
problem<00:03:54.380> however<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.609> have<00:03:55.670> no<00:03:56.060> way<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.690> read

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
problem however you have no way to read

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.710 
problem however you have no way to read
the<00:03:57.170> outputs<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.730> if<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.000> do<00:03:59.329> want<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.600> go

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the outputs and so if you do want to go

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.229 
the outputs and so if you do want to go
ahead<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.200> read<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> outputs<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.940> want<00:04:02.120> to

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
ahead and read the outputs you want to

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.370 
ahead and read the outputs you want to
place

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
place

repeater and don't worry about modifying
the<00:04:30.470> tix<00:04:30.940> then<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.120> can<00:04:32.390> on<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.500> side<00:04:33.740> go

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
the tix then you can on the side go

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.800 
the tix then you can on the side go
ahead<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.970> place<00:04:35.840> your<00:04:36.340> redstone<00:04:37.340> torches

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
ahead and place your redstone torches

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.790 
ahead and place your redstone torches
now<00:04:38.810> if<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.170> want<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.910> place<00:04:40.910> thus<00:04:41.720> or<00:04:42.110> place

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
now if you want to place thus or place

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.860 
now if you want to place thus or place
another<00:04:43.280> way<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.490> get<00:04:43.670> power<00:04:43.910> out<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.300> don't

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
another way to get power out of it don't

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.330 
another way to get power out of it don't
place<00:04:45.050> dust<00:04:45.380> because<00:04:45.740> once<00:04:45.920> again<00:04:46.010> they'll

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
place dust because once again they'll

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.700 
place dust because once again they'll
create<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.940> blood<00:04:47.300> switch<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.380> you're<00:04:48.560> also

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
create a blood switch so you're also

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.520 
create a blood switch so you're also
going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.070> want<00:04:49.160> over<00:04:49.820> Peters<00:04:50.210> on<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:51.080> side<00:04:51.350> if

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
going to want over Peters on the side if

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.740 
going to want over Peters on the side if
you<00:04:51.650> want<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.920> do<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:53.420> way<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.690> just

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
you want to do that and that way it just

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.300 
you want to do that and that way it just
gets<00:04:54.050> rid<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.320> bud<00:04:54.560> switch<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:55.070> now<00:04:55.250> you

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
gets rid of the bud switch and now you

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.220 
gets rid of the bud switch and now you
can<00:04:55.580> actually<00:04:55.730> pull<00:04:56.030> power<00:04:56.210> out<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:56.960> side

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
can actually pull power out of this side

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.180 
can actually pull power out of this side
as<00:04:57.410> well<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.860> put<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.850> into<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.120> line<00:04:59.420> for<00:04:59.900> a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
as well and put it into a line for a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.040 
as well and put it into a line for a
decimal<00:05:01.190> display<00:05:01.640> or<00:05:02.240> however<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:02.780> want<00:05:02.840> to

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
decimal display or however you want to

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.800 
decimal display or however you want to
do<00:05:03.170> it<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.520> now<00:05:04.760> if<00:05:04.910> i<00:05:05.000> press<00:05:05.210> these<00:05:05.450> you<00:05:05.690> can

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
do it so now if i press these you can

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.510 
do it so now if i press these you can
see<00:05:06.050> as<00:05:06.170> well<00:05:07.270> he'll<00:05:08.270> go<00:05:08.450> up<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:10.010> it'll<00:05:10.250> start

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
see as well he'll go up and it'll start

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.310 
see as well he'll go up and it'll start
counting<00:05:10.850> again<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.630> course<00:05:11.660> only<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
counting again and of course only the

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.230 
counting again and of course only the
correct<00:05:12.620> for<00:05:12.770> Peter<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.490> corresponds<00:05:14.000> will

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
correct for Peter the corresponds will

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.880 
correct for Peter the corresponds will
turn<00:05:14.390> on<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.870> then<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.230> can<00:05:15.380> connect<00:05:15.710> those

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
turn on and then you can connect those

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.980 
turn on and then you can connect those
repeaters<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.820> whatever<00:05:17.090> line<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.360> feel<00:05:17.780> like
