00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the eggs and stir really quickly so we

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.120 
the eggs and stir really quickly so we
don't<00:02:17.690> want<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> cook<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.349> eggs<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.920> want

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
don't want to cook the eggs so you want

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.729 
don't want to cook the eggs so you want
to<00:02:19.190> make<00:02:19.340> sure<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> eggs<00:02:20.500> gradually<00:02:21.500> get

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
to make sure that the eggs gradually get

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.720 
to make sure that the eggs gradually get
warmer<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.180> add<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.569> milk<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> next

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
warmer as you add the milk so the next

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.500 
warmer as you add the milk so the next
step<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.930> fill<00:02:27.290> our<00:02:27.590> ramekins<00:02:28.430> these<00:02:29.180> are
