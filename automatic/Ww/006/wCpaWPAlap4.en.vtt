00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
have all these wider detail again kind

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.540 
have all these wider detail again kind
of<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.620> battle-damaged<00:03:47.520> finish<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.360> and

again the molding and the detail finish

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.900 
again the molding and the detail finish
on<00:03:53.220> these<00:03:53.490> legs<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> very<00:03:55.320> very<00:03:55.560> nice<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.190> we

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
on these legs is a very very nice and we

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.910 
on these legs is a very very nice and we
do<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.240> articulation<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.680> waist

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
do have articulation to that your waist

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.120 
do have articulation to that your waist
tends<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.970> swivel<00:04:00.390> more<00:04:00.930> then<00:04:01.650> articulate

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
tends to swivel more then articulate

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.860 
tends to swivel more then articulate
backwards<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.850> forwards<00:04:03.240> so<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.600> swivel

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
backwards and forwards so you can swivel

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.770 
backwards and forwards so you can swivel
the<00:04:04.110> legs<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.460> articulated<00:04:05.850> after<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the legs and it is articulated after the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.360 
the legs and it is articulated after the
knee<00:04:06.960> section<00:04:07.440> as<00:04:07.560> well<00:04:07.710> so<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.130> bring

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
knee section as well so you can bring

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.530 
knee section as well so you can bring
these<00:04:08.870> lower<00:04:09.920> portion<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.220> legs<00:04:11.540> forwards

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
these lower portion of the legs forwards

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.990 
these lower portion of the legs forwards
or<00:04:12.660> backwards<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:14.190> final<00:04:14.670> part<00:04:14.880> of

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
or backwards and the final part of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.560 
or backwards and the final part of
articulation<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.530> feet<00:04:17.280> at<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:18.000> ankle

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
articulation is on the feet at the ankle

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.960 
articulation is on the feet at the ankle
joint<00:04:18.960> so<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.070> bring<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.370> forwards<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
joint so you can bring that forwards and

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.480 
joint so you can bring that forwards and
backwards<00:04:21.359> as<00:04:21.780> well<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.290> also<00:04:22.620> swivel<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
backwards as well and also swivel the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.540 
backwards as well and also swivel the
legs<00:04:23.700> left<00:04:24.480> and<00:04:24.750> right<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:25.860> figure<00:04:26.130> is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
legs left and right now this figure is

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.740 
legs left and right now this figure is
kind<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.710> counter<00:04:28.710> balanced<00:04:29.270> when<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.300> say<00:04:30.570> that

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
kind of counter balanced when I say that

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.450 
kind of counter balanced when I say that
I<00:04:30.780> mean<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:31.170> he's<00:04:31.350> leaning<00:04:31.740> forwards<00:04:32.340> because

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
I mean if he's leaning forwards because

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.290 
I mean if he's leaning forwards because
the<00:04:32.820> legs<00:04:33.030> do<00:04:33.330> come<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.440> backwards<00:04:35.160> as<00:04:35.669> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the legs do come out backwards as the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.000 
the legs do come out backwards as the
molded<00:04:36.810> design<00:04:36.930> carries<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.680> that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
molded design carries it that

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.670 
molded design carries it that
so<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.700> actually<00:04:39.090> get<00:04:39.570> Darth<00:04:39.870> Maul<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.350> stand

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
so to actually get Darth Maul to stand

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.310 
so to actually get Darth Maul to stand
up<00:04:40.860> when<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.550> get<00:04:41.790> him<00:04:42.030> I'll<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.810> say<00:04:42.990> comes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
up when you get him I'll just say comes

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.530 
up when you get him I'll just say comes
like<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.370> as<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.550> say<00:04:44.880> he<00:04:45.060> will<00:04:45.150> fall

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
like this and as you say he will fall

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.690 
like this and as you say he will fall
forward<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:46.650> what<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.860> need<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.130> do<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.520> is

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
forward so what you need to do this is

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.660 
forward so what you need to do this is
the<00:04:47.820> most<00:04:47.970> important<00:04:49.190> articulated<00:04:50.190> joint<00:04:50.460> on

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
the most important articulated joint on

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
the most important articulated joint on
this<00:04:50.940> figure<00:04:51.180> because<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:52.050> will<00:04:52.200> need<00:04:52.380> to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
this figure because you will need to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.970 
this figure because you will need to
pull<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.520> feet<00:04:53.790> backwards<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:55.320> get<00:04:55.500> Darth

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
pull the feet backwards to get Darth

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.790 
pull the feet backwards to get Darth
Maul<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.430> stand<00:04:56.790> upright<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:58.380> will<00:04:58.590> just

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
Maul to stand upright and I will just

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.160 
Maul to stand upright and I will just
demonstrate<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.790> name<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.600> they<00:05:00.720> can<00:05:00.960> see

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
demonstrate that name and they can see

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.980 
demonstrate that name and they can see
now<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.440> I've<00:05:02.090> pulled<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.390> joints<00:05:03.810> and

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
now that I've pulled the joints and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.080 
now that I've pulled the joints and
backwards<00:05:04.440> slightly<00:05:04.710> Darth<00:05:05.640> Maul<00:05:05.880> is

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
backwards slightly Darth Maul is

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.750 
backwards slightly Darth Maul is
standing<00:05:06.630> even<00:05:06.840> though<00:05:07.140> he<00:05:07.590> will<00:05:07.770> be<00:05:07.980> leaning

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
standing even though he will be leaning

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.330 
standing even though he will be leaning
backwards<00:05:09.450> slightly<00:05:09.720> as<00:05:10.170> you<00:05:10.350> can<00:05:10.560> see<00:05:10.800> but

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
backwards slightly as you can see but

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.450 
backwards slightly as you can see but
when<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.030> facing<00:05:12.750> forwards<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.950> won't<00:05:14.280> be

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
when it is facing forwards that won't be

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.150 
when it is facing forwards that won't be
so<00:05:14.910> obvious<00:05:15.120> so<00:05:16.110> there<00:05:16.350> he<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.470> going<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:17.010> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
so obvious so there he is going to the
