00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
a pretty good filmmaker at least when it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.340 
a pretty good filmmaker at least when it
comes<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.940> disaster<00:02:54.240> filmmaking<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.170> like

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
that movie a lot I like the dystopia

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.490 
that movie a lot I like the dystopia
venoth<00:02:57.420> at<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> special<00:02:57.900> effects<00:02:58.170> were<00:02:58.230> very

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
venoth at the special effects were very

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.580 
venoth at the special effects were very
good<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.880> was<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.180> fun<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.330> watch<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
good and it was just fun to watch so and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
good and it was just fun to watch so and
it<00:03:01.650> came<00:03:01.770> up<00:03:01.830> really<00:03:02.250> recently<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.390> think

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it came up really recently so I think

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.080 
it came up really recently so I think
making<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.650> film<00:03:04.890> which<00:03:05.459> doesn't<00:03:05.820> seem<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
making this film which doesn't seem to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.090 
making this film which doesn't seem to
really<00:03:06.330> go<00:03:06.989> for<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.260> overkill<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.830> that's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
really go for the overkill and that's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.800 
really go for the overkill and that's
what<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> want<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.760> disaster<00:03:09.360> movie<00:03:09.480> right

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
what you want in a disaster movie right

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.510 
what you want in a disaster movie right
this<00:03:10.260> seems<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> subtle<00:03:11.370> version

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
this seems to be like a subtle version

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.600 
this seems to be like a subtle version
of<00:03:11.989> 2012<00:03:12.989> why<00:03:13.230> would<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> want<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.830> go<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.400> see

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
of 2012 why would I want to go and see

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
of 2012 why would I want to go and see
that<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:14.970> seems<00:03:15.270> like<00:03:15.330> an<00:03:15.780> odd<00:03:15.900> choice<00:03:16.020> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
that it just seems like an odd choice to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.140 
that it just seems like an odd choice to
make<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.130> one<00:03:17.280> thing<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.090> about

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
make the one thing that I do like about

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.449 
make the one thing that I do like about
this<00:03:18.570> though<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.080> focus<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.770> rescue

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
this though is the focus on rescue

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.120 
this though is the focus on rescue
workers<00:03:20.940> rescue<00:03:21.840> workers<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.530> just

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
workers rescue workers are just

this<00:04:54.960> isn't<00:04:55.290> just<00:04:55.500> gonna<00:04:55.890> happen<00:04:56.130> on<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.490> west

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
this isn't just gonna happen on the west

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.340 
this isn't just gonna happen on the west
coast<00:04:56.910> you're<00:04:57.180> gonna<00:04:57.300> feel<00:04:57.600> us<00:04:57.720> on<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.080> East

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
coast you're gonna feel us on the East

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.200 
coast you're gonna feel us on the East
Coast<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.100> then<00:04:59.250> they<00:04:59.400> didn't<00:04:59.640> show<00:04:59.850> the<00:05:00.000> East

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
Coast and then they didn't show the East

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.330 
Coast and then they didn't show the East
Coast<00:05:00.450> they<00:05:00.690> were<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.960> hey<00:05:01.320> look<00:05:01.500> here's<00:05:02.070> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
Coast they were like hey look here's I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.340 
Coast they were like hey look here's I
think<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:02.970> was<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.450> Hoover<00:05:03.900> Dam<00:05:04.020> or

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
think that was like the Hoover Dam or

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.770 
think that was like the Hoover Dam or
something<00:05:04.710> breaking<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.670> in<00:05:05.790> Nevada<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.750> I

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
something breaking like in Nevada so I

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.450 
something breaking like in Nevada so I
was<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.260> what<00:05:07.560> are<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.710> talking<00:05:08.040> about<00:05:08.220> Paul

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
was like what are you talking about Paul

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.460 
was like what are you talking about Paul
Giamatti<00:05:08.730> everything<00:05:09.480> seems<00:05:09.750> fine<00:05:09.840> over<00:05:10.440> here

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
Giamatti everything seems fine over here

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.050 
Giamatti everything seems fine over here
so<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.190> think<00:05:11.370> they<00:05:11.610> should<00:05:11.640> if<00:05:11.880> they<00:05:11.910> were

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
so I think they should if they were

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.700 
so I think they should if they were
gonna<00:05:12.180> say<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.600> there's<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.930> big<00:05:13.140> scope<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.560> it

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
gonna say that there's a big scope to it

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.200 
gonna say that there's a big scope to it
they<00:05:13.830> should<00:05:14.010> have<00:05:14.100> shown<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.340> big<00:05:14.640> scope<00:05:14.850> to<00:05:15.090> it

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
they should have shown a big scope to it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.790 
they should have shown a big scope to it
and<00:05:15.570> maybe<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.960> might<00:05:15.990> say<00:05:16.290> hey<00:05:16.440> they<00:05:16.590> want<00:05:16.740> to

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
and maybe you might say hey they want to

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.350 
and maybe you might say hey they want to
save<00:05:16.980> something<00:05:17.250> for<00:05:17.400> later<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.090> just

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
save something for later this is just

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.060 
save something for later this is just
the<00:05:18.480> first<00:05:18.630> trailer<00:05:19.110> but<00:05:19.350> you<00:05:19.440> know<00:05:19.530> what<00:05:19.710> when

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
the first trailer but you know what when

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.560 
the first trailer but you know what when
it<00:05:20.160> comes<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.460> with<00:05:20.610> disaster<00:05:21.180> movie<00:05:21.420> when<00:05:21.540> you

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
it comes to with disaster movie when you

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.180 
it comes to with disaster movie when you
want<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.840> get<00:05:21.930> people<00:05:22.200> into<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.470> theater<00:05:22.770> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
want to get people into the theater you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.040 
want to get people into the theater you
don't<00:05:23.340> save<00:05:23.670> stuff<00:05:24.000> for<00:05:24.180> later<00:05:24.270> there<00:05:24.840> should

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
don't save stuff for later there should

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.350 
don't save stuff for later there should
be<00:05:25.170> so<00:05:25.380> much<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.620> this<00:05:25.860> movie<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.670> you<00:05:27.060> can't

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
be so much of this movie that you can't

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.700 
be so much of this movie that you can't
give<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.690> all<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.870> way<00:05:27.990> without<00:05:28.260> showing<00:05:28.590> the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
give it all the way without showing the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.320 
give it all the way without showing the
whole<00:05:28.830> movie<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.640> fact<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:29.940> maybe<00:05:30.150> they

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
whole movie and the fact that maybe they

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.700 
whole movie and the fact that maybe they
feel<00:05:30.510> they<00:05:30.630> need<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.780> save<00:05:31.080> stuff<00:05:31.260> for<00:05:31.530> later

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
feel they need to save stuff for later

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.350 
feel they need to save stuff for later
makes<00:05:31.950> me<00:05:32.100> think<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.580> might<00:05:32.790> be<00:05:32.820> a<00:05:32.940> little<00:05:33.120> low

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
makes me think it might be a little low

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.930 
makes me think it might be a little low
on<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:34.230> disaster<00:05:34.530> sequences<00:05:35.370> which<00:05:35.670> again

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
on the disaster sequences which again

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.940 
on the disaster sequences which again
this<00:05:36.360> little<00:05:36.630> point<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.020> movie<00:05:37.320> but<00:05:37.770> what

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
this little point of the movie but what

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.710 
this little point of the movie but what
do<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.100> think<00:05:38.430> do<00:05:38.850> you<00:05:38.940> like<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.300> trailer

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.320 
does it look like it can compete in one
of<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.460> most<00:05:41.610> crowded<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.180> competitive
