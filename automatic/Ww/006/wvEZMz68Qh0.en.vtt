00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 I live within five minutes of his 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 training I take my little 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.330
 lunch with them with seven players 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.220
 if I need massage after I see 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 I do my night that all I have to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 to do and after I started differently 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 when the workout is finished and we have 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 care to do the same 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.180
 while care often has nothing to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 see we have training in the morning we have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.690
 nothing there do that says that allows us 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 to rest h pink sheets and 1h 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.989
 so on the TV where I'm going to call him to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.989
 bank loans 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.790
 little by little it's better I take again I 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 begins to take 2 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.330
 good sensations compared to the year 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 latest 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.230
 it's true that collectively it's for 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 the moment is not easy but with the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.640
 work and the matches that go 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 chained I think it's going to be 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.670
 better and better just the most beautiful 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.140
 club competition 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 there is no better and that's like 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.970
 that said he discussed with my club 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 former 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.580
 when one is formed of his weak one must 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.140
 not dream better we'll say the effect 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.460
 disputed with my club trainer it's 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:39.180
 for these mothers to marvel we are going 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 to say it's a dream come true 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 it's this past chickens like like 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 had said valÃ¨re we have we have a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.640
 rather homogeneous print but well these are these 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.530
 guidelines that have the experience you 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 want to play summer league 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.830
 champions we know that here is every match 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.399
 will be complicated but each game will be 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.360
 difficult to play 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.600
 it's up to us to be at the level for the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 D-Day 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.760
 a match that marked me because the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.090
 final of the league of champions who 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.060
 had played against against porto you have 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.600
 watched at home that made and the matches 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.400
 against the real madrid when this one that 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.150
 because everyone was following at the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.150
 TV at the time 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.970
 do not hesitate yet to the ace monaco le 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.380
 cheaper in 2007 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.950
 coming to the center site 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.130
 it was his memories that I had 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.390
 the monaco ace of a big club that plays the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.320
 big teams and I hope 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:50.290
 that today we will be able to go from 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.720
 should spend those moments for for them 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.620
 supporters for us and for maybe 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.750
 for young people at the training center 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.110
 also maybe you dream like us and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:06.050
 they will arrive at this stage the cgt 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.920
 based on the genes have brought a 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.120
 few voices a little madness to try 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.500
 to associate tranquility with the studio 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 I think that's what we were told 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.260
 that he can do our strength 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.130
 like last season for many of 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.069
 to talk to young people about the advice that 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.359
 that's what they do and I believe that 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:38.019
 we need we will need it for 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:39.120
 all season but I hope you 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.159
 enjoyed the ride 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 here I hope that this Tuesday you go 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.680
 to be numerous to support us 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.889
 ten years later with champions so 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.889
 it's to do
