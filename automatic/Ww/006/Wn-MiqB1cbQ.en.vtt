00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.159 
perfectly thanks to the new articulation
and<00:04:26.680> he<00:04:27.580> also<00:04:27.760> comes<00:04:28.090> with<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.330> new<00:04:28.479> curie<00:04:28.870> knife

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
and he also comes with a new curie knife

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.270 
and he also comes with a new curie knife
which

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
which

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.070 
which
the<00:04:30.430> first<00:04:30.670> knife<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.150> be<00:04:31.270> introduced<00:04:31.750> into

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
the first knife to be introduced into

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.010 
the first knife to be introduced into
the<00:04:32.200> Halo<00:04:32.470> Mega<00:04:32.680> Bloks<00:04:32.860> line<00:04:33.420> it's<00:04:34.420> molded<00:04:34.870> in

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the Halo Mega Bloks line it's molded in

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.010 
the Halo Mega Bloks line it's molded in
silver<00:04:35.470> plastic<00:04:35.980> but<00:04:36.760> unfortunately<00:04:37.510> it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
silver plastic but unfortunately it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.340 
silver plastic but unfortunately it
cannot<00:04:38.440> be<00:04:38.650> shaved<00:04:38.980> onto<00:04:39.370> his<00:04:39.490> shoulder<00:04:39.850> plate

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
cannot be shaved onto his shoulder plate

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.140 
cannot be shaved onto his shoulder plate
which<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.380> probably<00:04:41.800> for<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.010> better<00:04:42.250> as<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
which is probably for the better as the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.909 
which is probably for the better as the
sheaf<00:04:43.360> itself<00:04:43.780> would<00:04:43.930> probably<00:04:44.260> be<00:04:44.380> bulky<00:04:44.770> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
sheaf itself would probably be bulky and

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.560 
sheaf itself would probably be bulky and
distracting<00:04:46.889> overall<00:04:47.889> for<00:04:48.610> about<00:04:48.760> $10<00:04:49.389> I

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
distracting overall for about $10 I

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.720 
distracting overall for about $10 I
definitely<00:04:50.169> have<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.320> say<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:51.280> set<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.700> worth

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
definitely have to say this set is worth

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.480 
definitely have to say this set is worth
it<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.240> my<00:04:52.270> opinion<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:53.080> may<00:04:53.980> seem<00:04:54.250> like<00:04:54.280> you're

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
it in my opinion it may seem like you're

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.370 
it in my opinion it may seem like you're
not<00:04:54.639> getting<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.060> much<00:04:55.300> but<00:04:56.050> believe<00:04:56.350> me

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
not getting that much but believe me

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.950 
not getting that much but believe me
that<00:04:57.220> new<00:04:57.460> Mongoose<00:04:57.910> does<00:04:58.180> wonders<00:04:58.720> when

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
that new Mongoose does wonders when

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.620 
that new Mongoose does wonders when
