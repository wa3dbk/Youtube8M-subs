actually<00:02:10.019> I'm<00:02:10.379> being<00:02:10.649> being<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.400> road

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
actually I'm being being on this road

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.520 
actually I'm being being on this road
quite<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.909> long<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.090> but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
quite a long time but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.040 
quite a long time but
but<00:02:13.650> uh<00:02:13.850> maybe<00:02:14.850> now<00:02:15.090> when<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.600> just<00:02:15.900> got<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
but uh maybe now when I just got a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.530 
but uh maybe now when I just got a
daughter<00:02:16.260> around<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.040> probably<00:02:17.580> I've

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
daughter around this so probably I've

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.030 
daughter around this so probably I've
seen<00:02:18.810> leave<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.110> may<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.290> teaching<00:02:19.890> or

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
seen leave it may be teaching or

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
seen leave it may be teaching or
something<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.540> think<00:02:21.569> it's

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
something like this but I think it's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.720 
something like this but I think it's
mostly<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.100> daughter<00:02:23.430> now

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
mostly about because of the daughter now

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.400 
mostly about because of the daughter now
and<00:02:23.910> everything<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> started<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.230> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
dad I don't just being around around the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.180 
dad I don't just being around around the
girl<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.720> such<00:02:43.110> watch<00:02:43.319> when<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:44.040> she

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
girl and just such watch when when she

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.610 
girl and just such watch when when she
grows<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.790> learn<00:02:45.000> new<00:02:45.209> things<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.140> mean

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
grows up and learn new things and I mean

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.560 
grows up and learn new things and I mean
there's<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:46.950> many<00:02:47.100> things<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.330> hard<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
there's so many things so it's hard to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.900 
there's so many things so it's hard to
say<00:02:48.810> what's<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> best<00:02:49.650> part<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.610> it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
say what's the best part but it's it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.540 
say what's the best part but it's it's
maybe<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.019> more<00:02:52.140> about<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.440> feeling<00:02:52.830> that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
maybe it's more about the feeling that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.729 
maybe it's more about the feeling that
you<00:02:53.670> have<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:54.209> pressures<00:02:54.690> something<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
you have that pressures something so

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.040 
you have that pressures something so
precious<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.459> done<00:02:56.700> done<00:02:57.630> something
