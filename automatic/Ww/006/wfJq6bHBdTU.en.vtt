mom I'm gonna be a comedian so the
history<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.410> intertwined<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.580> think

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
history is so intertwined that I think

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.029 
history is so intertwined that I think
it's<00:01:23.880> fascinating<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.539> this<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.170> find<00:01:25.440> so

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
it's fascinating at this time we find so

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's fascinating at this time we find so
much<00:01:26.159> cultural<00:01:27.060> misunderstanding<00:01:27.810> such<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
much cultural misunderstanding such a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
much cultural misunderstanding such a
great<00:01:28.860> divide<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.789> what<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.390> trying<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> do

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
great divide and what we're trying to do

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.389 
great divide and what we're trying to do
is<00:01:30.899> bridge<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> divide<00:01:31.410> through<00:01:31.979> something

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
is bridge that divide through something

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.550 
is bridge that divide through something
very<00:01:32.429> Universal<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:33.179> car<00:01:34.849> pulls<00:01:35.849> up<00:01:35.970> next

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
now the thing is I looked over and it

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.419 
now the thing is I looked over and it
looked<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.569> bunch<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.810> skinheads<00:01:40.399> but<00:01:41.399> I

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
looked like a bunch of skinheads but I

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.860 
looked like a bunch of skinheads but I
wasn't<00:01:41.640> gonna<00:01:41.789> judge<00:01:42.030> them

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.420

I<00:02:00.720> was<00:02:01.720> totally<00:02:02.110> confused<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:03.390> mean<00:02:04.390> could<00:02:04.540> I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
I was totally confused I mean could I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.180 
I was totally confused I mean could I
simultaneously<00:02:05.470> embody<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
simultaneously embody the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.540 
simultaneously embody the
characteristics<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.910> Osama<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.750> got<00:02:08.170> me<00:02:08.550> what

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
characteristics of Osama and got me what

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.590

is<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.729> terrorism<00:02:10.150> not<00:02:10.479> violence

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.580 

what<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:18.870> never<00:02:18.990> they<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.290> fit<00:02:19.500> we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
what I really never they do fit we

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.260 
what I really never they do fit we
should<00:02:19.740> explain<00:02:19.980> ourselves<00:02:20.160> better<00:02:20.550> people

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
should explain ourselves better people

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.330 
should explain ourselves better people
believe<00:02:21.540> whatever<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.080> they<00:02:22.230> believe

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
believe whatever it is they believe

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.920 
believe whatever it is they believe
based<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:23.730> saw<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.060> television<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
based on what they saw on television and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.680 
based on what they saw on television and
so<00:02:25.410> Muslims<00:02:25.800> are<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.400> social<00:02:26.850> body<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.300> very

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
so Muslims are as a social body are very

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.870 
so Muslims are as a social body are very
very<00:02:27.960> behind<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.590> ball<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:29.640> they<00:02:29.760> have

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
very behind the ball because they have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760 
very behind the ball because they have
not<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.330> figured<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.750> yet<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.230> so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
not really figured that out yet and so

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.620 
not really figured that out yet and so
everybody<00:02:32.280> else<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.520> talking<00:02:32.910> about<00:02:32.970> them<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
everybody else is talking about them and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.850 
everybody else is talking about them and
they're<00:02:34.140> not<00:02:34.170> doing<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:34.680> good<00:02:34.740> job

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
they're not doing a very good job

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.550 
they're not doing a very good job
talking<00:02:35.640> about<00:02:35.790> themselves<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> think<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
talking about themselves so I think that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
talking about themselves so I think that
you<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> calling<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.150> me<00:02:39.240> in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you know this is a calling for me in

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.600 
you know this is a calling for me in
life<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.560> certainly<00:02:40.800> see<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> rest<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.520> my
