00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.080
 it is such a thing with traditions for some they are holy and 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.450
 The beloved of a bygone one died worth living for the others 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.450
 Time 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
 so is that synonymous with compare between VW Golf and Ford Focus 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 only one was ever in the fast lane here 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.189
 the golf 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.940
 So that does not continue, Ford brings the Focus St against the GTI 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.740
 position 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.730
 and Cologne points first full of performance 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 Drs mobilizes 225 hp to impressive values ​​for sprint and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.649
 top speed 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.649
 only the consumption is a bit high 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.030
 the Wolfsburg keep with their latest the area of ​​the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.080
 now sixth generation has less power to offer with 210 hp than 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.600
 the focus but in the performance 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.270
 there is a tie 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 who has the edge today clears the test program 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 in the sprint against GC you and SC equal 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 both complete the standard spurt to one hundred kmh in six chambers 9 seconds 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.390
 and also in the course of the Focus can be an extra 15 hp 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.930
 do not translate into a lead 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.820
 he is in the elasticity makes the larger displacement of the SC noticeable 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 he leaves the GTI behind 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 when braking a similar picture 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.210
 the two athletes live at very similar levels after the brakes 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.280
 the gold rush needed a speed of 100 kmh one meter 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.960
 less braking distance read on Stockholm slowed Focus a bit better 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 but both always stay below the 40 meter mark 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.850
 Next is rattling the first 18 meters but beat that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.749
 be demonstrated 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.299
 Petersburg was perpetrated from Lebanon Syria 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:12.830
 after that will become 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.830
 not really for the weekend will be more expensive again 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.060
 the authorities want the report 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.200
 with whistles or those in dialect or steering that is but long 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.260
 I was there yesterday 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.579
 is sent 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.339
 in the foreground 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.339
 been covered 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:45.090
 That's why the fun is especially great because the Tigers stern is one of his favorites 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.299
 sudden gas take away Cheerful with directs and the front-wheel drive even 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.049
 overrides 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.430
 sportier is the Golf more comfortable but the focus in the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.619
 most points won equity 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:01.879
 And so the old tradition continues in this comparison 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.870
 Krefeld on some points for the Ford Focus for a course 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.099
 Pfeiffer for her children engine 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.009
 which also offers significantly more pulling power than the GTI 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.489
 the added new slightly higher consumption will be bought 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.590
 He wants to give reason for joy quickly in front but not quite so Ortmüller 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.649
 also feels the more comfortable suspension tuning of Focus 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.929
 So again, only the second place remains for the calendar 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.490
 but even the GTI is far from shining 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.490
 there is still room for improvement here as well 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.179
 while Vettel 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.309
 these are allowed 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.679
 the inexperienced preventative can surprise certain situations 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.679
 luckily there is i find it myself 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.609
 "Of course we follow the complex and electronic reasons 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.719
 chassis control 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 Crossing between the individual functions 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.569
 who speak the Golf GTD say captivatingly precise handling 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.629
 his header but at the same time efficient engines and then Hollywood 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.629
 with white interior and a big gap 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.009
 the comparisons are clearly the result Golf GTI 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.330
 that was also to be expected everything else would mean that Israel 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.340
 Do not keep track of your homework 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.940
 And so he leaves the focus at the end is the Dams clear behind 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.970
 a result with tradition 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.030
 because only with a reasonable engine and a comfortable suspension 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.249
 You can the tour organizer sporty compact car 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:47.659
 just do not defeat
