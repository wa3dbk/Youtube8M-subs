00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 mathematician we talk about public thermals about our partner 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.240
 cristina adecco east coast 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.680
 where they will teach you how to do the treatment that lasts for years 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.700
 and what are the alternatives is that there are alternatives that the truth is that 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.809
 we know how many houses there were many houses to the mayor of madrid 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.809
 that it is estimated that they had true termites 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.630
 Well, that's the best way to see hundreds of houses in the center of Madrid 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 it is estimated that they could be affected 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.619
 by these small insects small insects that cause damage like these 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.070
 I'm looking at it may seem that the wood is old but if you're 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.220
 blades 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 with a very clear image of an invasion of termites then we will see 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.159
 how can we say is 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.910
 you can or can not finish 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 these insects because the truth is that he is going to tell us and ismael very good 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.630
 days hello good morning yes we can end this plague is again 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.720
 I can finish it 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.240
 the breastplate of us we use 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.300
 in which without that use of baits 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.719
 percent reigned with an inhibitor of chitin formation 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.109
 of what the termites are respected 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.420
 for which they are transmitting the poison to the interior of the colony and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.980
 remove 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.160
 the whole colony 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.740
 within the allow or aido social to place these issues 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.160
 one of them was following this let's see 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.360
 one is the fire that is placed on the ground 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.190
 as you see has a wood that goes buried 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.490
 since the termites are of underground habits they had been under 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.540
 land 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.010
 this is one of the types of bait just twists and here under 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.200
 kiev bets lama in the matter tiba to sponsor termites the other 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 option if you want to go inside if we have inside to see it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940
 are you going if you think 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.800
 ismael cow comments distinguish us each termite nest can get to have more 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.960
 of three million of these little insects 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.200
 that can end up devouring everything door frames furniture cabinets 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 even the expensive floors are so fashionable these floors in wood can 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.060
 finish 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.270
 with them and nothing in very little time we will see another topic here what 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999
 we have since that day 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.860
 the other option this would be a bait peer 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.730
 in the bar placed a plate 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.390
 cellulose trainer even impregnated with an inhibitor of the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.169
 chitin formation as I said 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.399
 the insects come they are eating all the bait as you can see it is unfair 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.859
 and myths we want little white are ismael techniques those are the 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.959
 reliable termites of isnos that are with the biggest red head that are the 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.779
 soldiers 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.979
 and the smallest the most homogenous are the worker zones 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.739
 even the two main castes sections to always in the pigs because 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.759
 they are organized 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.120
 I do not know if as bees as ants have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.099
 the queen have the workers 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.169
 they also have the novels that supply the food that are with these 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.640
 retardant president not growing what I do know is that they cause 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.319
 malformations that the colony does not feed and thus be able to undermine the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.469
 clouds or excess to be the idea really that poison the very little bit by bit 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.819
 to be able to eliminate all the territory because if we kill they are the ones that 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.789
 come to eat stop eating in this segob 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.429
 and would continue to parcels the wood of the house we find this fence that is missing 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.550
 because it has already been 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.040
 food totally by termites in colon with series find out ismael 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.420
 exactly where they are located by the way is that the allowed and the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.400
 places where they are going to attack there are two systems you told me, well, there it is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.770
 and three systems the first observe the wood what you are going to do is 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.340
 begin to present small objects we will see remains of earth as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.289
 we can see here 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.739
 that also the wood when you press it what you do 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.989
 Mutu wood is late really this web with below 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.889
 the bands with a small blade 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.059
 above wood to protect the light everything its light and fires 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.459
 and what we are not going to find are this type of objects 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.919
 and then at the professional level to locate it directly 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.669
 ain 2 yes vos de distro mentos 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.840
 only one of the rector is of emory ment it's as if you stay here 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.019
 are you employing 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.309
 put it on in the area where they were going to since there is a bar that you see going up 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.989
 going down depending on which termites pass plan 2000e of the driver by 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:57.839
 microwave oven 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.010
 We deserved that inc 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.959
 they wanted to deny them little by little let's move on to keep watching is more with 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.549
 the prominent DNA where it is suffering from this plague of termites in which 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.200
 we say that it is not the only one hundred houses that are affected in all 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.960
 Madrid 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.019
 affects mainly the wooden molds 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.910
 like these but we're going to keep seeing more things because you tell us there's 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.120
 go poisoning them ismael little by little we will move up to this other 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.659
 room 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.840
 all a meticulous labor a very uncomfortable work with a lot of hard work 

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:30.279
 emphasis that can last up to five years even finish them up 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.709
 five years really the colony is controlled a year and a half two 

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.979
 years what happens is that you have to keep it until 5 years possible 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:37.999
 sprouts 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.499
 be aware that allows them to be very large as dependencies 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.419
 3 million individuals 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.860
 and can extend up to 50 meters 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.430
 from 50 meters with the pheromone the queen does not carry the reproach of 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.419
 secondary 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.080
 for a couple of the colony they would become queens 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.950
 we understood another termite nest 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.060
 here we see another door was also affected the we see two demos as those that 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.939
 we see earlier and as you can see is ismael removing that tape that covers 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.050
 because we see that it is totally opaque they have totally finished 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.939
 with this truth 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.860
 another system because we have 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.999
 is this that both here is an acoustic detector 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.830
 he just looked at it with very sensitive state 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.229
 and what is your sling 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.360
 lets try 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.580
 listen to it I do not know if you can hear it is the dish its sound 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.530
 very similar 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.500
 he said it in a vulgar way but as if it were a new one coming from roots they are 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.110
 the termites working 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.379
 that's the clicks that you hear 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.529
 are termites working are the jaw of termites applied on 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.559
 the wood and simply if more does not have 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.909
 has no more complications we said ismael that affects especially 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.220
 to old houses of more than 50 years places where humidity where there 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.330
 wood and there 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.320
 cellulose 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.200
 i do not know is if you could tell us why 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 there are some times he told us is that he showed up earlier with housing 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.539
 she then well in the beams of the structure affected by these termites 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.949
 and that when you pick them up as karl hass says for washed wood is not the solution 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.639
 solution precisely because if you substitute old wood form of the 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.449
 new 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.129
 the termite what it is going to do is come to feed on blood saves wood that 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.849
 we have placed you have more nutrient-rich 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.150
 was going to destroy before the the wood we had not really placed does not consist 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.860
 in replacing wood 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 but in eliminating the allows what we have under the house 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.580
 because we were saying maybe in some housing yes that we achieved 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.389
 finish with that allows hoop to be clean housing this plague of 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.600
 insects but the next house is 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.800
 they are going to be and that we have 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.190
 a new outbreak finally show you com has been this friendly alipio 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.150
 begoña los de tirana pp task because I thought at first that maybe 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.280
 they had been his grandchildren 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.270
 but the truth 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.060
 ortega 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.520
 is that as a country to listen 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.990
 this pop 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.190
 totally 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.389
 mueck or totally guaco in this area 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.389
 even if you press with your finger 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.379
 good mazon 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.040
 that is, it is not a problem that affects many 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.059
 households 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.239
 the island and for the people who may be watching, do not say that I think I'm going to 

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:09.389
 have this problem 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.490
 what can we do can be attacked quickly the moment they appear 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.320
 these signs 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.400
 we are already invaded by city and we are employing them to do this without speaking 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.650
 at the end of the debate embedded down the best thing is to call a specialist who 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.580
 still nobody a good diagnosis 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.779
 and start working on them counted before many thanks ismael 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.809
 you already know if you are thinking that you can have thermal without house the best 

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:33.739
 go to specialists because as we have been told you can not see anything will change the 

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:37.429
 of the wood exchange it for another new snow travel it with another type of 

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:38.880
 material as it can be 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.129
 she was a problem 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.749
 quite serious that affects as we say begoña alipio still very many 

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:45.139
 buildings 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:48.139
 although there are not many tenants who know 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.529
 had given clues will fly to detect it empty they got married to people to 

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:54.389
 pigs 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.460
 personally people who are crazy to presumably plan to kill that 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.639
 presides also which agreed that now has has arrangement
