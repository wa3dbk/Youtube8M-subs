00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
oh here's the movement up the wind just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.799 
oh here's the movement up the wind just
quit

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

quit
oh<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.260> set<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.650> transmitter<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.430> trying<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
oh I set my transmitter off trying to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.299 
oh I set my transmitter off trying to
trim<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:52.110> dangerous

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.410 

busted<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> smithereens

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:12.179 

darn

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.139 

well<00:01:13.189> as<00:01:13.280> far<00:01:13.549> as<00:01:13.670> I'm<00:01:13.850> concerned<00:01:14.439> that<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:17.090> a

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
well as far as I'm concerned that is a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.899 
well as far as I'm concerned that is a
bad<00:01:17.540> design<00:01:17.990> I'm<00:01:18.890> reaching<00:01:19.340> over<00:01:19.579> like<00:01:19.729> this

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
bad design I'm reaching over like this

00:01:19.909 --> 00:02:05.420 
bad design I'm reaching over like this
and<00:01:19.970> just<00:01:20.180> instantly<00:01:20.630> shut<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:21.229> off

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.500 

pretty<00:02:06.360> bad<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> transmitter<00:02:07.470> economics

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
pretty bad at a transmitter economics

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.890 
pretty bad at a transmitter economics
good<00:02:09.510> flight<00:02:10.550> here's<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> did<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.270> this

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
good flight here's what I did this this

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.590 
good flight here's what I did this this
switch<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.560> turns<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.670> easy<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
switch just turns on very easy on and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.650 
switch just turns on very easy on and
off<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.710> got<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> Ridge<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
off and it's got a Ridge up there and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.290 
off and it's got a Ridge up there and
the<00:02:19.350> trim<00:02:19.680> switch<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.550> clear<00:02:21.090> over

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the trim switch is actually clear over

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.320 
the trim switch is actually clear over
here<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:21.870> flying<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
here so I'm flying like this with this

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
here so I'm flying like this with this
hand<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.770> let<00:02:26.070> go<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
hand and this like this so I let go and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.290 
hand and this like this so I let go and
reach<00:02:27.300> across<00:02:27.630> trying<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:29.430> wind<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.030> bind

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
reach across trying in this wind to bind

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
reach across trying in this wind to bind
that<00:02:30.510> trim<00:02:30.840> switch<00:02:31.170> which<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.590> can't<00:02:31.860> even<00:02:32.160> feel

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
that trim switch which I can't even feel

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.040 
that trim switch which I can't even feel
because<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.820> doesn't<00:02:33.150> stick<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.480> enough<00:02:33.810> as

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
because it doesn't stick up enough as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.180 
because it doesn't stick up enough as
you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.380> don't<00:02:34.590> want<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.830> let<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
you know you don't want to let go of

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.900 
you know you don't want to let go of
this<00:02:35.570> switch<00:02:36.570> that's<00:02:37.080> why<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.610> should<00:02:38.610> be

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
this switch that's why this should be

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.700 
this switch that's why this should be
over<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:41.040> switch<00:02:42.170> should<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.230> over

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
over here and this switch should be over

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.140 
over here and this switch should be over
here<00:02:43.740> or<00:02:44.610> somewhere<00:02:45.000> else<00:02:46.520> I've<00:02:47.520> got<00:02:47.760> nothing

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
here or somewhere else I've got nothing

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.800 
here or somewhere else I've got nothing
against<00:02:48.570> airfield<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.950> uh<00:02:50.390> their<00:02:51.390> stuff<00:02:51.660> is

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
against airfield but uh their stuff is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:00.500 
against airfield but uh their stuff is
pretty<00:02:52.020> good<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.490> bad<00:02:59.510> okay

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
pretty good but this this is bad okay

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.030 
pretty good but this this is bad okay
all<00:03:00.780> back<00:03:00.990> together<00:03:01.200> it's<00:03:01.620> got<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.800> few

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
all back together it's got a few

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.790 
all back together it's got a few
wrinkles<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.470> park<00:03:04.680> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
wrinkles on it now but now I can park it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.500 
wrinkles on it now but now I can park it
next<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> front<00:03:05.430> door

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.789 

well<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.780> didn't<00:03:16.200> come<00:03:16.230> without<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> little

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
well it didn't come without a little

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.380 
well it didn't come without a little
pain<00:03:17.099> if<00:03:17.400> you're<00:03:17.519> gonna<00:03:17.609> use<00:03:17.760> electric<00:03:18.209> glue

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
pain if you're gonna use electric glue

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.380 
pain if you're gonna use electric glue
gun<00:03:18.629> which<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.019> did<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.680> got<00:03:20.159> it

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
gun which I did and I really got it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.410 
gun which I did and I really got it
burned<00:03:21.390> my<00:03:22.170> fingers<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:23.609> my<00:03:23.879> hand<00:03:24.480> really<00:03:24.629> work

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
burned my fingers on my hand really work

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.970 
burned my fingers on my hand really work
well<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.689> was<00:03:27.870> another<00:03:28.170> first<00:03:28.439> for<00:03:28.650> me<00:03:28.950> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
well this was another first for me and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.789 
well this was another first for me and
it<00:03:29.370> recalls<00:03:29.760> my<00:03:30.090> saying<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.930> every<00:03:31.530> flight

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
it recalls my saying that every flight

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.819 
it recalls my saying that every flight
is<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:32.010> test<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.209> every<00:03:33.510> crash<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> lesson

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
is a test and every crash is a lesson

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.920 
is a test and every crash is a lesson
and<00:03:35.519> I've<00:03:35.730> learned<00:03:36.030> I'm<00:03:36.389> not<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.719> to<00:03:36.780> do

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and I've learned I'm not going to do

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.469 
and I've learned I'm not going to do
that<00:03:37.170> again
