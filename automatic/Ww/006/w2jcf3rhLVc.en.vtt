00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 keep accounts of everything that the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.500
 team is winning the contract 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.320
 the profits 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300
 with percentages of each one being with 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.219
 he or she corresponds 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.290

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:44.530
