once<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.450> full<00:01:39.780> enough<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
once I've got it full enough and I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
once I've got it full enough and I
realize<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.189> can't<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> whole<00:01:41.850> thing

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
realize you can't see the whole thing

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
realize you can't see the whole thing
but<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.170> how<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.470> just

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
but you can kind of see how I'm just

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.789 
but you can kind of see how I'm just
layering<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.840> then<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> start<00:01:46.320> adding<00:01:46.500> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
layering here then I start adding in

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.370 
layering here then I start adding in
some<00:01:47.040> secondary<00:01:47.520> colors<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.750> some

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
some secondary colors now I have some

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.569 
some secondary colors now I have some
white<00:01:49.770> alstroemeria

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
white alstroemeria

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.399 
white alstroemeria
which<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.119> stick<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:51.990> bit

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
which can stick out just a little bit

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
which can stick out just a little bit
above<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.360> strategically

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
above and so I'm just strategically

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.289 
above and so I'm just strategically
placing<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> you'll<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:57.060> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
placing those in and you'll see how they
