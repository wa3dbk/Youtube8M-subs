found<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.030> after<00:05:54.650> completely<00:05:55.650> balanced

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
found that after completely balanced

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.100 
found that after completely balanced
spin<00:05:56.190> so<00:05:56.370> I'm<00:05:56.490> making<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.390> one<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.630> descaling

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
spin so I'm making this one of descaling

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.570 
spin so I'm making this one of descaling
but<00:05:58.890> I<00:05:58.920> always<00:05:59.160> do<00:05:59.520> we'll<00:06:00.390> find<00:06:00.630> out<00:06:00.810> when<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.170> do

but I always do we'll find out when I do

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:13.460 
but I always do we'll find out when I do
spin<00:06:02.580> that's<00:06:02.670> completely<00:06:03.030> balanced<00:06:12.470> no

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470
