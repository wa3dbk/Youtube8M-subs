till it goes click now let's check that

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.170 
till it goes click now let's check that
is<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.489> all<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.849> way

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
is in all the way

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.360 
is in all the way
just<00:03:50.660> check<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.959> operation<00:03:51.379> of<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.160> Sun

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
just check the operation of the Sun

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.890 
just check the operation of the Sun
Visor<00:03:52.609> that<00:03:52.879> it<00:03:52.940> goes<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.419> down<00:03:53.449> correctly

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
Visor that it goes up and down correctly
