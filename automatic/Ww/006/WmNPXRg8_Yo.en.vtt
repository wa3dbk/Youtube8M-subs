Decatur<00:00:13.559> Georgia<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.309> week's<00:00:14.519> EMF<00:00:15.000> tips

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
Decatur Georgia for this week's EMF tips

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.000 
Decatur Georgia for this week's EMF tips
and<00:00:15.480> tricks<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.230> week<00:00:16.470> we're<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and tricks this week we're going to be

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.189 
and tricks this week we're going to be
talking<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.310> why<00:00:17.609> balance<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:19.050> there

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
talking about why balance and there

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
talking about why balance and there
really<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.529> nothing<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:20.070> exciting<00:00:20.340> than

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
really is nothing more exciting than

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.960 
really is nothing more exciting than
light<00:00:20.820> balance<00:00:21.150> right<00:00:25.460> why<00:00:26.460> balance<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
light balance right why balance is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
light balance right why balance is
basically<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> camera<00:00:27.990> adjusting<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> color

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
basically the camera adjusting the color

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
basically the camera adjusting the color
balance<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:29.640> image<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.179> items<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
balance of an image so that items that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.150 
balance of an image so that items that
the<00:00:30.929> human<00:00:31.199> eye<00:00:31.289> would<00:00:31.500> perceive<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> white

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the human eye would perceive is white

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
the human eye would perceive is white
actually<00:00:32.640> appear<00:00:33.030> white<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.989> recorded

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
actually appear white on the recorded

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.010 
actually appear white on the recorded
image<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.760> might<00:00:35.910> ask<00:00:36.090> yourself<00:00:36.300> why

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
image and you might ask yourself why

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
image and you might ask yourself why
white<00:00:37.350> stuff<00:00:37.620> wouldn't<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.070> appear<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.579> wife

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
white stuff wouldn't just appear as wife

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
white stuff wouldn't just appear as wife
and<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.840> answer<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.440> different<00:00:40.829> light

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and the answer is that different light

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.530 
and the answer is that different light
sources<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.550> different<00:00:41.879> hues<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.300> color

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
sources have different hues or color

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.020 
sources have different hues or color
temperatures<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:44.010> example<00:00:44.370> sunlight<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> an

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
temperatures for example sunlight on an

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
temperatures for example sunlight on an
average<00:00:45.149> day<00:00:45.329> has<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> color<00:00:46.079> temperature

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
average day has a color temperature

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
average day has a color temperature
around<00:00:46.620> fifty<00:00:47.100> six<00:00:47.309> hundred<00:00:47.610> Kelvin<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
around fifty six hundred Kelvin and a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
around fifty six hundred Kelvin and a
normal<00:00:48.809> incandescent<00:00:49.050> light<00:00:49.559> bulb<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
normal incandescent light bulb has a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.459 
normal incandescent light bulb has a
color<00:00:50.280> temperature<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:50.910> 3200<00:00:51.539> Kelvin<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
color temperature around 3200 Kelvin and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
color temperature around 3200 Kelvin and
on<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> kelvin<00:00:53.399> scale<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.000> higher<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
on this kelvin scale the higher the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240 
on this kelvin scale the higher the

use that to adjust the color you can

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
use that to adjust the color you can
simply<00:01:45.030> zoom<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> white<00:01:45.899> object<00:01:46.350> until

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
simply zoom in on the white object until

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.170 
simply zoom in on the white object until
it<00:01:46.710> fills<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> frame<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.909> press<00:01:48.149> the

it fills the frame and then press the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
it fills the frame and then press the
white<00:01:48.509> balance<00:01:48.720> set<00:01:49.140> button<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.070> use
