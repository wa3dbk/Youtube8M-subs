00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
to be hydrated but they have they go

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.780 
to be hydrated but they have they go
through<00:03:15.349> another<00:03:15.739> almost<00:03:16.010> called<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.550> beef

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
through another almost called a beef

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.360 
through another almost called a beef
bath<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.349> would<00:03:18.530> give<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.220> them

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
bath so that would give that of them

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.190 
bath so that would give that of them
even<00:03:19.940> better<00:03:20.890> tendered<00:03:22.090> these<00:03:23.090> tester<00:03:23.959> once

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
even better tendered these tester once

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.960 
even better tendered these tester once
