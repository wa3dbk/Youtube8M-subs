00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
unit and this was part of a larger kit

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
unit and this was part of a larger kit
that<00:00:49.170> had<00:00:49.320> batteries<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> an<00:00:50.039> inverter<00:00:50.370> but

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that had batteries and an inverter but

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.220 
that had batteries and an inverter but
the<00:00:50.820> inverter<00:00:51.090> went<00:00:51.329> bad<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> batteries

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the inverter went bad and the batteries

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
the inverter went bad and the batteries
went<00:00:52.440> bad<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.219> saved<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> solar<00:00:54.120> panel

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
went bad so I saved the solar panel

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
went bad so I saved the solar panel
itself<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.739> and

finding brackets and mounts for solar
panels<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> challenge<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.810> you've

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
panels can be a challenge if you've

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
panels can be a challenge if you've
looked<00:01:10.080> into<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.939> all<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> panels<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.630> these

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
looked into it all the panels have these

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.240 
looked into it all the panels have these
little<00:01:13.020> notches<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.590> connect<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> something

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
little notches to connect to something

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
little notches to connect to something
but<00:01:14.640> everybody<00:01:15.330> seems<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> different

but everybody seems to have a different

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
but everybody seems to have a different
method<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> company<00:01:17.850> rhinology<00:01:18.180> has

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
method so this company rhinology has

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
method so this company rhinology has
this<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.290> guess<00:01:19.530> you'd<00:01:19.680> call<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> Universal

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
this I guess you'd call it a Universal

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
this I guess you'd call it a Universal
solar<00:01:20.970> kit<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:22.020> bolts<00:01:22.380> onto<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> bottom<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
solar kit that bolts onto the bottom of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460 
solar kit that bolts onto the bottom of
the<00:01:23.159> panel<00:01:23.549> allows<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> panel<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> stand<00:01:25.259> off

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the panel allows the panel to stand off

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.280 
the panel allows the panel to stand off
the<00:01:25.680> roof<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.700> heat<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.600> escape<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the roof a bit so heat can escape and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
the roof a bit so heat can escape and
water<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> debris<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.820> flow<00:01:30.060> underneath<00:01:30.479> now

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
water and debris can flow underneath now

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
water and debris can flow underneath now
in<00:01:31.170> preparation<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.950> project<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in preparation for this project I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
in preparation for this project I
actually<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:32.939> extra<00:01:33.240> silicone

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
actually put a little extra silicone

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.499 
actually put a little extra silicone
there<00:01:34.049> around<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> cable<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.240> port

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there around the cable and the port

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
there around the cable and the port
where<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:36.900> could<00:01:37.049> chain<00:01:37.320> multiple<00:01:38.009> panels

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
where they could chain multiple panels

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.179 
where they could chain multiple panels
together<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.390> won't<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.689> doing<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
together because I won't be doing that

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.050 
together because I won't be doing that
so<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.520> extra<00:01:41.880> weather

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so that's a little extra weather

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.840 
so that's a little extra weather
proofing<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.560> brackets<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.220> actually

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
proofing but these brackets are actually

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.520 
proofing but these brackets are actually
pretty<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:45.810> pleased<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.380> I'm

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pretty nice very pleased with them I'm

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.170 
pretty nice very pleased with them I'm
actually<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> house<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
actually using them at the house in

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and around the bracket I'm actually

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.170 
and around the bracket I'm actually
using<00:02:45.690> roofing<00:02:46.260> screws<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.010> a

can<00:03:20.850> flow<00:03:20.880> through<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:21.780> build<00:03:21.959> up

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
can flow through so you don't build up

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080 
can flow through so you don't build up

weekend last Saturday we came out we put
the<00:03:48.000> drip<00:03:48.180> valve<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.630> we<00:03:49.050> put<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> spin<00:03:49.560> down

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
the drip valve in we put the spin down

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.699 
the drip valve in we put the spin down
filter<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.810> positioned<00:03:51.810> all<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.110> valves<00:03:52.320> to

catch rainwater to bring it over here
into<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.660> tank<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.709> rained<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.160> Tuesday

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
into this tank and it rained on Tuesday

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.850 
into this tank and it rained on Tuesday
out<00:03:57.209> here<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.720> looks<00:03:58.230> like<00:03:58.440> we<00:03:58.590> caught<00:03:58.800> a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
out here and looks like we caught a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.220 
out here and looks like we caught a
little<00:03:59.040> bit<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.310> water<00:03:59.900> let's<00:04:00.900> try<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> get

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
little bit of water let's try to get

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.530 
little bit of water let's try to get
down<00:04:01.380> here<00:04:01.590> without<00:04:01.709> tripping<00:04:02.360> but<00:04:03.360> there's

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
down here without tripping but there's

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.680 
down here without tripping but there's
the<00:04:03.720> mechanical<00:04:04.580> water<00:04:05.580> level<00:04:05.880> gauge<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
the mechanical water level gauge and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.360 
the mechanical water level gauge and
that<00:04:06.840> was<00:04:06.990> set<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.290> empty<00:04:07.620> last<00:04:07.860> weekend

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
that was set to empty last weekend

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.550 
that was set to empty last weekend
because<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.700> tank<00:04:08.940> was<00:04:09.090> empty<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.380> come

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
because the tank was empty so it's come

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.290 
because the tank was empty so it's come
up<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.800> little<00:04:10.890> bit<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.640> I'm<00:04:11.790> gonna<00:04:11.910> guess

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
up a little bit so I'm gonna guess

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.710 
up a little bit so I'm gonna guess
that's<00:04:12.840> probably<00:04:14.030> 10<00:04:15.030> inches<00:04:15.270> of<00:04:15.390> water<00:04:15.540> in

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that's probably 10 inches of water in

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.330 
that's probably 10 inches of water in
the<00:04:15.810> bottom<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.230> tank<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:16.950> not<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> whole

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the bottom of the tank it's not a whole

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.740 
the bottom of the tank it's not a whole
lot<00:04:17.580> but<00:04:17.790> didn't<00:04:17.970> rain<00:04:18.120> too<00:04:18.299> heavy

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
lot but didn't rain too heavy

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.789 
lot but didn't rain too heavy
we're<00:04:19.200> supposed<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.500> have<00:04:19.620> some

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
we're supposed to have some

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.530 
we're supposed to have some
thunderstorms<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.669> week<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.209> I'll<00:04:21.330> get<00:04:21.510> a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
thunderstorms this week so I'll get a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.450 
thunderstorms this week so I'll get a
neighbor<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.989> send<00:04:22.200> me<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.350> picture<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:23.250> see

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
neighbor to send me a picture and see

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.400 
neighbor to send me a picture and see
how<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.760> doing<00:04:24.180> but<00:04:24.600> at<00:04:24.720> least<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.020> proof

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
how this is doing but at least the proof

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.290 
how this is doing but at least the proof
of<00:04:25.530> concept<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:26.130> working<00:04:26.490> here

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
of concept is working here

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.770 
of concept is working here
we're<00:04:27.449> able<00:04:27.569> to<00:04:27.870> take<00:04:28.259> water<00:04:28.560> off<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> roof

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
we're able to take water off the roof

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.930 
we're able to take water off the roof
run<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:31.020> down<00:04:31.259> through<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.590> pipe<00:04:31.830> here<00:04:32.160> let

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
run it in down through the pipe here let

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.270 
run it in down through the pipe here let
it<00:04:33.030> drop<00:04:33.210> down<00:04:33.270> go<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.960> first<00:04:34.199> wash<00:04:34.500> back

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it drop down go to the first wash back

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.129 
it drop down go to the first wash back
up<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.699> pipe<00:04:35.909> sufficient<00:04:36.780> enough<00:04:36.960> to

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
up in the pipe sufficient enough to

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.770 
up in the pipe sufficient enough to
rinse<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.470> roof<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.460> pipe<00:04:38.729> backs<00:04:39.000> up<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
rinse the roof the pipe backs up the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.050 
rinse the roof the pipe backs up the
ball<00:04:39.990> floats<00:04:40.349> up<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> we<00:04:41.460> catch<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.849> water

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
ball floats up and we catch the water

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.360 
ball floats up and we catch the water
through<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.419> spin<00:04:42.690> down<00:04:42.870> filter<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:44.129> it<00:04:44.220> looks

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
through the spin down filter so it looks

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.820 
through the spin down filter so it looks
like<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.729> working<00:04:45.569> okay<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.080> as<00:04:46.530> always

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
like it's working okay and as always
