00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Welcome to the fourth chapter of the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.560
 guide down I am electro pinillo and os 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.120
 I bring special skills down and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 your cancellation of or total we will begin 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.269
 by the jumps of walls equal hobbes the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 simplest way to do them is 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.259
 using it towards the wall and the third 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 As you can see in the video this 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.199
 It can also be done without the e but 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 we will have to place ourselves 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.539
 manually looking at the wall and totally 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.279
 stuck 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.600
 also to know if we can jump a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 wall or a corner is as easy as 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 approaching put the cursor over the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 cv and if the circle reaches more than half 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the wall as you can see in the image what 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.179
 we can jump with the workshops are 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 really useful when it comes to pursuing 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 people or to escape from them practicing them 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.950
 a lot when it comes to the truth to fail is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 under pressure 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.770
 remember that you can jump any 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 structure including towers or 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 inhibitors and that you can jump by 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 corners as you see in some of the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:57.690
 videos that I leave in addition another way of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
 jump the walls is to use a guard 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 this we will not need to use 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 too much since we will almost always have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.439
 it brings us though it's always good to know 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 it's as easy as getting closer 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.920
 possible and put the guard to the other 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 the wall so that they arrive they turn and in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 Cali to the wall here I show you in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.500
 video 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 besides this last use the wards we 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 allow to use the CV to change the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.570
 address of the third q is the same 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.890
 that when jumping a wall but without 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 the wall this allows us to cut 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 enemy skills like the cv's 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
 leasing as you can see in the video but 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 also other gases such as 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 go and say many other 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.660
 skills of champions now I'm going to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.310
 explain the cancellation of the auto attack 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.020
 with this I mean that the combo of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.550
 cv with interspersed attacks will be 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 incredibly faster being able 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.510
 save one or two enemy attacks 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 Here I show you the combo without canceling the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.720
 animation so you see lasts between 4 and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.340
 5 seconds 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 and here I bring you the combo with the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 canceled animation that are 3 seconds and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.320
 This one is especially slow but 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.270
 With practice, you can get into 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.380
 a second and a half approximately for 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 make the combo all you have to do 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.920
 to do is to do just after and most 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.900
 quick as possible to enter the other 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.610
 attack and while doing the q click on 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.630
 the soil this has to be repeated three 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 times for the full combo 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 thank you all for watching the guide I hope 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.360
 that you are liking the following 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.069
 chapter will be tim fight with river 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.970
