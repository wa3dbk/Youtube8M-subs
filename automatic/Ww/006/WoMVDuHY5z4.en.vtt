00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
studio 10 tutorials so I hope you're

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.880 
studio 10 tutorials so I hope you're
ready<00:00:14.289> because<00:00:14.799> we're<00:00:15.129> about<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.339> get<00:00:15.549> started

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.980 

in<00:00:20.890> anime<00:00:21.490> studio<00:00:21.520> you<00:00:22.330> can<00:00:22.480> do<00:00:22.660> what<00:00:22.869> is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
in anime studio you can do what is

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.710 
in anime studio you can do what is
called<00:00:23.320> random<00:00:24.160> linewidth<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.090> basically

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
called random linewidth and basically

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.740 
called random linewidth and basically
with<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.590> set<00:00:27.040> of<00:00:27.070> points<00:00:27.340> down<00:00:27.700> you<00:00:28.330> can<00:00:28.510> put

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
with a set of points down you can put

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.109 
with a set of points down you can put
this<00:00:28.869> feature<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:30.400> line<00:00:30.610> width<00:00:30.820> will

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
this feature on and the line width will

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.510 
this feature on and the line width will
be<00:00:31.150> randomized<00:00:31.720> between<00:00:32.290> points<00:00:32.830> just<00:00:33.460> to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
be randomized between points just to

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.000 
be randomized between points just to
kind<00:00:33.790> of<00:00:33.850> give<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.330> more<00:00:34.690> stylized<00:00:35.530> effect

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
kind of give it a more stylized effect

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.280 
kind of give it a more stylized effect
the<00:00:36.820> thing<00:00:37.030> was<00:00:37.239> with<00:00:37.480> previous<00:00:37.870> versions<00:00:37.930> of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
the thing was with previous versions of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.439 
the thing was with previous versions of
anime<00:00:38.620> studio<00:00:38.830> this<00:00:39.640> could<00:00:39.820> sometimes<00:00:40.059> be<00:00:40.330> a

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
anime studio this could sometimes be a

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.720 
anime studio this could sometimes be a
bit<00:00:40.510> jarring<00:00:41.020> because<00:00:41.650> you<00:00:42.070> could<00:00:42.250> go<00:00:42.400> from<00:00:42.580> a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
bit jarring because you could go from a

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.490 
bit jarring because you could go from a
really<00:00:43.030> thin<00:00:43.360> line<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.840> really<00:00:44.410> really

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
really thin line to a really really

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.189 
really thin line to a really really
thick<00:00:44.890> line<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:46.180> would<00:00:46.360> look<00:00:46.540> just<00:00:46.809> a

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
thick line and it would look just a

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.850 
thick line and it would look just a
little<00:00:47.559> bit<00:00:47.830> off<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:48.879> with<00:00:49.390> version<00:00:49.690> 10<00:00:50.199> you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
little bit off so with version 10 you

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.740 
little bit off so with version 10 you
can<00:00:51.010> see<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.519> some<00:00:51.699> points<00:00:52.120> selected<00:00:52.540> here

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
can see I have some points selected here

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.539 
can see I have some points selected here
if<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:53.769> go<00:00:54.040> up<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.280> draw<00:00:55.710> random<00:00:56.710> line<00:00:56.979> width<00:00:57.309> or

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
if I go up to draw random line width or

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.210 
if I go up to draw random line width or
command<00:00:58.239> D<00:00:58.360> or<00:00:58.750> control<00:00:59.409> D<00:00:59.440> if<00:00:59.769> you're<00:01:00.010> on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
command D or control D if you're on

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.960 
command D or control D if you're on
Windows<00:01:00.839> we<00:01:01.839> have<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.379> box<00:01:02.739> up<00:01:03.010> here<00:01:03.250> here<00:01:03.580> and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
Windows we have the box up here here and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.230 
Windows we have the box up here here and
you<00:01:04.120> can<00:01:04.269> see<00:01:04.540> even<00:01:04.870> with<00:01:05.170> my<00:01:05.830> minimum<00:01:06.400> set<00:01:06.970> to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
you can see even with my minimum set to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.280 
you can see even with my minimum set to
0<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.960> my<00:01:08.140> maximum<00:01:08.740> set<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.280> over<00:01:09.640> 300<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:11.080> can

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
0 and my maximum set to over 300 you can

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.920 
0 and my maximum set to over 300 you can
see<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.310> transition<00:01:12.640> between<00:01:13.150> thick

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
see that the transition between thick

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.660 
see that the transition between thick
and<00:01:14.200> thin<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.940> lot<00:01:16.360> more<00:01:16.780> gentle<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:18.580> an

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and thin is a lot more gentle like an

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.640 
and thin is a lot more gentle like an
example<00:01:19.180> with<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.600> Hat<00:01:19.900> here<00:01:20.200> we<00:01:20.320> go<00:01:20.440> from

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
example with the Hat here we go from

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.550 
example with the Hat here we go from
really<00:01:20.890> thick<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.369> thin<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.720> then<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.320> next

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
really thick to thin but then the next

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.899 
really thick to thin but then the next
connecting<00:01:23.920> line<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.369> doesn't<00:01:24.609> look<00:01:24.729> as

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
connecting line it doesn't look as

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.599 
connecting line it doesn't look as
jarring<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.740> even<00:01:26.740> if<00:01:26.829> we<00:01:26.950> just<00:01:27.130> randomized

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
jarring and even if we just randomized

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.539 
jarring and even if we just randomized
this<00:01:27.969> in<00:01:28.180> different<00:01:28.390> ways<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:29.619> can<00:01:29.799> see<00:01:30.070> that

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
this in different ways you can see that

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.880 
this in different ways you can see that
it<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.329> course<00:01:31.570> randomizes<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.649> line

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
it of course randomizes the line

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.249 
it of course randomizes the line
thickness<00:01:33.250> like<00:01:33.909> right<00:01:34.149> here<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.450> right<00:01:34.810> here

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
thickness like right here and right here

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.539 
thickness like right here and right here
but<00:01:36.100> again<00:01:37.060> less<00:01:37.570> jarring<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.280> if<00:01:39.399> you're

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
but again less jarring so if you're

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.520 
but again less jarring so if you're
interested<00:01:39.880> at<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.960> feature<00:01:41.170> or

interested at all in this feature or

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.440 
interested at all in this feature or
have<00:01:41.710> used<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.219> the<00:01:42.340> past<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:43.119> can<00:01:43.270> look

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
have used it in the past you can look

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.859 
have used it in the past you can look
forward<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.899> knowing<00:01:44.109> that<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.100> has<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.520> been

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
forward to knowing that it has now been

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.969 
forward to knowing that it has now been
enhanced<00:01:46.869> if<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.590> would<00:01:47.679> like<00:01:47.799> more
