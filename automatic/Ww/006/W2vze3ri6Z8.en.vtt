00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.510
 it's good for peas and ages of life 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.789
 no problem to park 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.400
 leave us the field 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.400
 but it's mostly the beginning of the week 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.660
 but it's like that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 it is true 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 we must not let him go 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.850
 provision should not, however, be systematically such solutions 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 that africa is the version with the 2030s 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.020
 al maghribi rates 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.310
 my party would be around 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.620
 good news 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 he shows with exelixis 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.819
 it's actually it's the equivalent in the constructor 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.410
 when you are one meter wide 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.220
 to move in urban areas 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.460
 we have the best turning radius that gets its name from the four wheels the lens 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090
 it is to be able to sneak it is a little what is called the rise of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.950
 but you still do not earn 25% of the time spent in 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.640
 traffic 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.430
 I do not have much 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.920
 we are immune 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.630
 at the level of what I mean 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 I think the right seems impossible 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 there is no compromise on security 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.420
 on an electric motor the maximum torque 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 is available in fact the first accelerations we need to be 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.730
 it was decisive for mission of 0 50 meters which is really 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.990
 the reference in terms of acceleration 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.130
 we take care 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.400
 on a standard socket 3 hours maximum 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.090
 hyperdynamics we will manage to reach 55 km in terms of autonomy 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.570
 and if we are really ecodrived we will arrive at some 80 kilometers 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.900
 in fact i am very good at new york 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 this exit I liked it is not for you 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 several points 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.050
 this one will start from 6990 euros 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.550
 and this work tax incentives in France for example today we can 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.929
 estimate that but it will be accessible from 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.139
 5600 the euro first prize 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 it is in these terms are not enough for his habits 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.379
 it's back to school 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.469
 moving on friday 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.769
 we can see on the road 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.759
 lawyer 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.219
 it's a habit
