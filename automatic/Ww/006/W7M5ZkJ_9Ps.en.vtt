I'm looking like this and how I find it
is<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.949> basically<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.309> take<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> webbing<00:00:59.940> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is I basically just take the webbing in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
is I basically just take the webbing in
my<00:01:00.120> hand<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.510> run<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.260> okay<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.670> that's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
my hand then run it down okay so that's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.570 
my hand then run it down okay so that's

don't really know how to set up for
their<00:01:24.330> bowing<00:01:24.720> there's<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.049> kinds<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
their bowing there's all kinds of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.170 
their bowing there's all kinds of
different<00:01:25.470> spins<00:01:25.950> coming<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
different spins coming out so if you can

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.749 
different spins coming out so if you can
get<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> clean<00:01:27.750> set<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.829> rest<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.520> job

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
get a clean set up the rest of your job

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
get a clean set up the rest of your job
gets<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.420> easier<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.290> volley<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.799> what

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
gets a lot easier on the volley so what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920 
gets a lot easier on the volley so what
I<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
I like to think about is that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.999
