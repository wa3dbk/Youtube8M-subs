machine<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:42.079> don't<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> hell<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
machine I don't know what the hell that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.580 
machine I don't know what the hell that
means<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> basically<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.450> um<00:00:45.870> it's

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
means but what I basically do is um it's

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
means but what I basically do is um it's
just<00:00:46.980> an<00:00:47.190> old<00:00:47.280> picture<00:00:47.610> frame<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.899> i<00:00:49.610> strung

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
just an old picture frame which i strung

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
just an old picture frame which i strung
up<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.850> some<00:00:50.969> yarn<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> ceiling<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
up with some yarn to the ceiling so I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.420 
up with some yarn to the ceiling so I
can<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.710> overhead<00:00:52.949> view<00:00:53.600> like<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
can get an overhead view like so and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
can get an overhead view like so and
that's<00:00:56.430> why<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> times<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's why a lot of the times at the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's why a lot of the times at the
beginning<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:58.770> unboxing<00:00:59.430> videos<00:01:00.000> or

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
beginning of my unboxing videos or

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.360 
beginning of my unboxing videos or
around<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:01.440> certain<00:01:01.829> times<00:01:02.129> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
around them around certain times it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
around them around certain times it's
like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.879> wobbly<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
like a little bit wobbly because it is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.620 
like a little bit wobbly because it is
held<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:05.010> yarn<00:01:05.369> i'm<00:01:05.909> hoping<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.570> a
