00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 from this night which envelops me from 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 pole to pole black as the tomb 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello the film factory there is 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.269
 directly new facts that are all 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 arrived very well and i have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 my head back into the network and its 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260
 research and there are ten new ones 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.180
 facts for you I have one first 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.890
 very interesting story from the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.930
 soldier james ryan here wanted steven 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 spielberg necessarily that it is so real and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 Realistically authentic is just like it 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 goes and has therefore all ammunition and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.660
 all shots of real weapons on one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 Shoot gun in rain and shoot 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 that's why everything is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.879
 what you are hearing is very very real for him 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 German dubbing was that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.379
 that's just too real in those days 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 the second world war just that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 everything experienced and this emotional 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.559
 he has not tolerated reality and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 had one more during the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 be exchanged synchronously 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.750
 sometimes it's the teeny-tiny ones 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 details that please you so much too 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.629
 at watchmen in the grand opening 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.270
 You can see credits night of the one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.589
 Thief a skin and at the same time 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 saving couples and if you are accurate 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.570
 background looks you can see that that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.920
 the couple the parents of bruce wayne 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 So he actually has to be from 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 batman 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 but that means that they survived 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 and in the watchmen universe is therefore 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200
 no batman can give 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 of course I have something again 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 brought by alien what 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.820
 Everything happened in this movie 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 the alien costume she really big 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.619
 is a student and he wanted 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.439
 namely discovered was over two meters 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.450
 big two meters 10 exactly and he has 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.280
 keep extremely long and thin arms and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 was therefore very suitable for it 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.880
 he then has such tai chi lessons and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.399
 play lessons get up to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.860
 to slow down his movements by more 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.600
 but he never has 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.340
 something was never done with film again 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 again on a stage and was too 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.610
 never seen in the world again 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 connection with the film industry 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.549
 but with the most famous being about the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.380
 become movie history of the movie can 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.149
 by the way holds the record for the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
 Most contributors in a game for 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.090
 march 300.000 people come to me 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 funeral service 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 and those were from 11 camera teams 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.300
 filmed that is about four hours 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.950
 material was recorded 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 which ultimately only two in the movie 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.000
 minutes were the crazy because 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.920
 more than 99 999 percent of the performers 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.140
 make just a percent of the whole 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.670
 A funny story is also there 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.670
 from all men there is this scene 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.200
 in the tonys, on the other hand, the end of the film 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.360
 the press conference in the newspaper 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.520
 leafs and there's such an amateurish 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.690
 photo by tony is hard to find this 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 photo is real 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 it was in fact by the paparazzi at 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.820
 the shooting behind a bush of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.950
 shot them and because the topic 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.150
 But even fit well one has 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.740
 said come we take the picture 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.140
 just with in the film then he gets 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.660
 also somehow what he wanted and so 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.160
 then landed a real recording even 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 did not have the purpose in the movie too 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.240
 come at the end of the final in oberg 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.700
 orange, yes there is the famous 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.880
 rape scenes and stanley 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.160
 Kubrick really has four whole days on 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.750
 piece of this scene turned something in front 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 all because he always wanted to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.870
 conventionally she was not perfidious 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.060
 she was not mean she was not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 vicious enough and that's why he agrees 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.070
 his main actor realize that he 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.170
 singing and dancing should be doing while 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.970
 All this happens because the actor 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.070
 but no song by heart could except 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.380
 singing in the rain long just this 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.630
 song and that of stanley kubrick sophies 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.980
 and so absurd and so mean that he 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.660
 said shit needs on everyone 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.900
 fall the movie rights and have them right away 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.570
 for 10.000 euro so the song rights for 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.100
 saved the film and that was all 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.950
 not so planned but one was born 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 the most notable movie scenes of 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.610
 film history 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.459
 By the way, black swan had the set 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.380
 no doctor than natalie portman himself 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.750
 but then turned a rib and that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.600
 noted that the budget is too low 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.130
 she immediately gave it heroic as she did 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.830
 Well, the exit is too 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.959
 win their own caravan from to 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.610
 with this money what would be saved 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.290
 to hire a doctor for the tenants 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.120
 and then of course a bit 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.140
 in self-interest because she wanted, of course 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.880
 be treated 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.000
 a very interesting fact to the film 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.640
 invictus in the movie of clint eastwood there 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.410
 plays morgan freeman nelson mandela and 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.989
 the title of the film thus invictus 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.780
 based on a poem what nelson 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.690
 Mandela in his 27-year-old sticking by 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.160
 brought all these torments 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.530
 has and has worn and there I would 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.350
 like to quote a few lines from 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.440
 this night that envelops me from pole to 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.110
 pol black as the grave thank you 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.140
 which always god image the informal 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.470
 soul we gave that is a poem what 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.090
 at that time in the real world a very 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.040
 important personality 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.610
 becomes the title of a complete 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.990
 motion pictures 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.910
 we all know that quentin 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.370
 tarantino neatly a roof damage 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.080
 which has us very good because of it 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.960
 his films are always so crazy and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.350
 horny but he has the pussy wagon moscow 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.930
 really wants to keep and it stands 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.760
 Actually, as this picture proves here 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.890
 still in his driveway mine 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 Last fact this week I have 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.210
 from cast away and there I can now 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.830
 already say I pull every hat for it 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.230
 I would even buy new hats 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.320
 to draw this well again is in fact 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.780
 The stallion has become extremely extreme 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.700
 let a lot more weight increase 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.620
 to play the scenes if he still completely 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.260
 lives normally at home and at fedex 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.760
 works and then he has everything again 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.169
 has decreased the beard grow 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.380
 let him so that he so wild 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.870
 looks at the four years of scenery 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.490
 you spend there on the island and that 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.930
 So all had to go under 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.060
 That means we first shot it 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.950
 and for over a year, it has been turning 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.200
 but interrupted because the director 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.580
 robert zemeckis not I thought so then 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.260
 I'm doing now and nothing 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.630
 wait until the tom hanks somehow again 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.220
 slim he has the film shadow of 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.060
 truth turned the then also in 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.190
 the cinemas came 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.750
 before yesterday was finished with those 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.630
 had to finish that first 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.210
 means sometimes not just cgi goes 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.500
 or computer effects sometimes need 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.510
 we still people through the 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.250
 Hell go to make good movie and 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.410
 tom stallion did that and for that 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.820
 good for who sees more facts 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.919
 he wants to look over here 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.300
 is the last part linked or one 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.910
 Review of in the movie of the now in the cinema 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.370

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.590
 like the canal 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.210
 that is what you will always do 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.430

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.439

 Here the film factory with me the 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.789
 Doneck
