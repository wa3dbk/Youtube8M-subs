00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.080
 or the one of the most popular recipes in 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.150
 the youtube channel is that of hummus and 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.160
 after the israel trip I realized 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.289
 which can also be improved with 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.150
 Guitar collaboration is much more 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.039
 fast you can always meet you 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.470
 the chickpeas themselves but if you want 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.050
 save time and energy use 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.029
 Canned chickpeas cooked facilitates 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.980
 much the task well as you see the first 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.169
 What we do is overturn a boat 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.880
 chickpeas in a bowl and now we're going to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.340
 add the tajín and this is the main 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.260
 difference with the previous version 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.110
 you have to put enough tajín for a 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.110
 kilo of chickpeas about 300 grams of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 tajín we also add the juice of a 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 lemon always depending on the quantity 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.930
 make clear 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.470
 a good pinch of salt 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.860
 and you can put a couple of cloves of garlic 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.010
 raw me to make it softer I use 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.570
 45 roasts wrapped in albal paper and 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 I've put them on fire about 10 minutes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 and this is so easy you can add a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.810
 trickle of olive oil I'm going to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.810
 add after we crush it well 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.970
 You see we have left the cooking broth 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.370
 the chickpeas that we still have one 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.200
 much fluffier mix, nothing dry 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.200
 as you will see it is like a cream 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.400
 see what you paint 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.780
 and now we're going to finish it off with some 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780
 sesame seeds 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.640
 a splash of oil 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.759
 and we finish it off with a little parsley 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.759
 chopped fresh 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040
 easy and fast this always triumphs 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.490
 I hope you enjoyed a hug 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.490
 see you later
