 THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 In the film you play the devil's advocate, a sort of James Bond ... 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.240
 whose secret mission is to investigate Christians all over the world. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 How did the idea come about? 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.860
 In the film there are two screenwriters: 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.200
 one is Alexis, who is out of her mind. 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.680
 We are here, in front of the Capitol, 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 where it seems that a cloud of mutant mosquitoes is attacking the Senate. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.720
 And this helps a script. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.680
 When you write a screenplay very accurately, hermetically, rationally ... 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.880
 perfect films come out, structurally ... 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 but you have the feeling that it has already been done, that it is copied. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.320
 The figure of the devil's lawyer, if I remember correctly ... 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.500
 created by Alexis, so if someone didn't like it ... 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.660
 I blame him. 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.400
 Apart from the comic aspect ... 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 has something that for me is very close to the film's purpose, which is ... 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.020
 "Let us approach the truth without fear." 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.700
 For me the devil's advocate is the spectator's defender. 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 Of the spectator who has simple questions ... 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.950
 and directed on faith and the lawyer gives him a voice. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.600
 These are not unpleasant questions. 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.700
 These are uncomfortable questions for those who have a faith that asks no questions. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820
 The faith of those who support: 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.360
 "I don't know, but since the Church says it, I believe it." 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.520
 This answer is not enough for the devil's advocate. He wants to know! 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.040
 How your respondents reacted, who are real people with very real stories, 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.989
 to being questioned by a fictitious character like the devil's advocate? 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.771
 Some of the protagonists ... 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.660
 they have fallen into a profound bewilderment. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.600
 Why you call one and tell him: "Listen ... 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.720
 we want to make a film about faith experiences, we would like to talk to you ... " 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.660
 "Well!" 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 I believe most of them expected a conventional interview. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.120
 When we start with humor, we see in their faces expressions like: 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.100
 "I don't know if I was right to trust these people." 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.209
 I remember one of the interviewees who after a day of filming ... 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.140
 before doing the interview he asked me, a little in private: 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.000
 "But is it a comedy or what?" 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.040
 Ask them for a great act of trust: "Trust us. TRUST!" 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.240
 We laugh a lot and do things that are not in the film, 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.900
 but actually the interviewee remains baffled. 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.660
 And did the interviews follow a script like your character? 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.580
 At the time of doing the interviews, we follow a very open and simple path: 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.920
 A first initial question, two general questions 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.040
 trying to be open to what the conversation presents us. 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.780
 If you prepare a questionnaire, before listening to the interviewee, 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.000
 you close to listening and change your questions based on what you hear. 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.200
 We follow a method that is inconvenient for Alexis, 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.500
 especially in editing, or letting people talk, 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.120
 forget about being interviewed with a camera and a microphone. 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.560
 We don't call them interviews, but conversations. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.340
 When the person is at ease, without realizing it, he opens his heart to you.
