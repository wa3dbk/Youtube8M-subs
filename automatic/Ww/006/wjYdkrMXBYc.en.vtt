the<00:00:06.270> research<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.810> we've<00:00:06.899> been<00:00:07.560> involved

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the research that we've been involved

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.009 
the research that we've been involved
with<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.370> at<00:00:08.460> Dartmouth<00:00:08.900> has<00:00:09.900> focused<00:00:10.440> on

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
with here at Dartmouth has focused on

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.299 
with here at Dartmouth has focused on
several<00:00:13.019> different<00:00:13.139> fronts<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
several different fronts one of which is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.150 
several different fronts one of which is
the<00:00:14.790> stem<00:00:15.089> cell<00:00:15.299> therapy<00:00:15.770> which<00:00:16.770> has<00:00:16.949> really

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the stem cell therapy which has really

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.179 
the stem cell therapy which has really
developed<00:00:17.430> over<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.240> past<00:00:18.359> ten<00:00:18.990> years<00:00:19.189> and

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
developed over the past ten years and

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910 
developed over the past ten years and
it's<00:00:20.670> been<00:00:20.789> shown<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.240> taking<00:00:22.230> stem<00:00:22.590> cells

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's been shown that taking stem cells

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.849 
it's been shown that taking stem cells
and<00:00:23.779> injecting<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:24.900> into<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.230> leg<00:00:25.650> that's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and injecting them into a leg that's

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
and injecting them into a leg that's
ischemic<00:00:26.390> ischemic<00:00:27.390> means<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.109> much

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
ischemic ischemic means there's not much

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
ischemic ischemic means there's not much

blood flow getting to the leg that when

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
blood flow getting to the leg that when
these<00:00:30.750> cells<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.349> injected<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.189> area

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
these cells are injected into the area

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
these cells are injected into the area
since<00:00:33.390> there's<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.989> blood<00:00:34.320> getting

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
since there's not much blood getting

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.340 
since there's not much blood getting
into<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> leg<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.600> oxygen

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sense that low oxygen level and then

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.950 
sense that low oxygen level and then
change<00:00:43.050> themselves<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:44.450> cells<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.750> can

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
change themselves into cells that can

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
change themselves into cells that can
then<00:00:46.350> either<00:00:47.129> make<00:00:47.640> new<00:00:47.850> blood<00:00:48.059> vessels<00:00:48.510> or

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then either make new blood vessels or

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
then either make new blood vessels or
potentially<00:00:49.440> heal<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.550> wound<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
potentially heal the wound that's on the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.400 
potentially heal the wound that's on the
leg<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.070> found<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.410> patients

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
leg what we found was that in patients

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.360 
leg what we found was that in patients
who<00:00:55.440> receive<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.780> stem<00:00:57.780> cell<00:00:58.020> therapy<00:00:58.469> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
who receive the stem cell therapy that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
who receive the stem cell therapy that
if<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> combine<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.989> risk<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.500> wound

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
if you combine the risk of wound

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.000 
if you combine the risk of wound
worsening<00:01:02.789> death<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.600> major<00:01:03.930> amputation<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
worsening death or major amputation that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.460 
worsening death or major amputation that
it<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.250> significantly<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.600> six

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it was significantly better at six

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
it was significantly better at six
months<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> patients<00:01:09.090> who<00:01:09.150> received<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
months so the patients who received the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
months so the patients who received the
stem<00:01:09.869> cells<00:01:10.140> had<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> lower<00:01:10.619> incidence<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
stem cells had a lower incidence of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.350 
stem cells had a lower incidence of
amputation<00:01:12.890> wound<00:01:13.890> worsening<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.670> death<00:01:15.000> when

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
amputation wound worsening or death when

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.749 
amputation wound worsening or death when
compared<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> placebo-treated<00:01:16.470> patients

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
compared to the placebo-treated patients

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
compared to the placebo-treated patients
in<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.090> truly<00:01:18.659> remarkable<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
in what was truly remarkable about it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
in what was truly remarkable about it
was<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> relatively<00:01:21.540> small

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
was that it was a relatively small

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
was that it was a relatively small
number<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.380> patients<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.100> yet<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.400> still<00:01:23.460> saw

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
number of patients and yet we still saw

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.630 
number of patients and yet we still saw
clinically<00:01:24.900> significant<00:01:25.680> improvement<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
clinically significant improvement in

the stem cell treated patients compared

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
the stem cell treated patients compared
to<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> placebo<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.960> whether<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.229> holds<00:01:31.770> up

to the placebo now whether that holds up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.420 
to the placebo now whether that holds up
in<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.310> larger<00:01:32.729> phase<00:01:33.000> 3<00:01:33.329> trial<00:01:34.040> which<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> the

final trial to get this approved by the
FDA<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.159> unclear<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.990> early<00:01:40.259> results<00:01:40.590> are

FDA is unclear but the early results are
quite<00:01:40.920> promising<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.420> compelling

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
quite promising and it's compelling

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.160 
quite promising and it's compelling
enough<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.159> there's<00:01:44.369> no<00:01:44.520> question<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.299> the

enough that there's no question that the
pivotal<00:01:47.009> trial<00:01:47.340> needs<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> done<00:01:48.299> as

the patient then returns and under local

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.730 
the patient then returns and under local
anesthesia

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
anesthesia

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.560 
anesthesia
with<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.520> bit<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> sedation<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.450> make

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
with a little bit of sedation to make

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.320 
with a little bit of sedation to make
them<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> little<00:02:15.930> sleepy<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.670> them<00:02:17.850> lie<00:02:18.090> on

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
them a little sleepy we have them lie on

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.230 
them a little sleepy we have them lie on
their<00:02:18.510> stomach<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:20.070> we<00:02:20.250> make<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> small

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
their stomach and then we make a small

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.080 
their stomach and then we make a small
incision<00:02:21.560> that's<00:02:22.560> maybe<00:02:23.340> an<00:02:23.520> eighth<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.970> an

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
incision that's maybe an eighth of an

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.860 
incision that's maybe an eighth of an
inch<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.420> length<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:25.230> their<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:26.160> hip<00:02:26.870> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
inch in length in their right hip and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
inch in length in their right hip and
it's<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.580> there<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.480> back<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
it's in the more in there the back and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280 
it's in the more in there the back and
we<00:02:32.280> take<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.520> needle<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.510> place<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.900> down

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
we take a needle and then place it down

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
we take a needle and then place it down
onto<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.280> bone<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:35.850> push<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.360> needle

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
onto the bone and then push the needle

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.990 
onto the bone and then push the needle
through<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.530> bone<00:02:37.920> marrow<00:02:38.130> through<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> bone

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
through the bone marrow through the bone

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.200 
through the bone marrow through the bone
into<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.390> marrow<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.410> aspirate<00:02:41.180> about<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
into the marrow we then aspirate about a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.060 
into the marrow we then aspirate about a
quarter<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.810> cup<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.260> bone<00:02:43.530> marrow<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
quarter of a cup of bone marrow that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.000 
quarter of a cup of bone marrow that
whole<00:02:44.490> thing<00:02:44.820> takes<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.480> maybe<00:02:46.260> 10<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.650> 15

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
whole thing takes about maybe 10 to 15

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.270 
whole thing takes about maybe 10 to 15
minutes<00:02:47.310> once<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.360> done<00:02:48.710> we<00:02:49.710> hold<00:02:50.010> some

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
minutes once it's done we hold some

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.770 
minutes once it's done we hold some
pressure<00:02:50.550> at<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> site<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> few<00:02:51.480> minutes

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
pressure at the site for a few minutes

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.220 
pressure at the site for a few minutes
and<00:02:52.020> then<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.890> patient<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.400> home<00:02:53.540> maybe<00:02:54.540> 30

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
and then the patient goes home maybe 30

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380 
and then the patient goes home maybe 30
minutes<00:02:55.440> later<00:02:55.710> 40<00:02:56.040> minutes<00:02:56.340> later<00:02:56.520> depend<00:02:57.330> on

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
minutes later 40 minutes later depend on

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.340 
minutes later 40 minutes later depend on
how<00:02:57.480> much<00:02:57.600> sedation<00:02:58.080> they<00:02:58.170> received<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.780> bone

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
how much sedation they received the bone

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.690 
how much sedation they received the bone
marrow<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.770> aspirate<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.520> placed

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
marrow that we aspirate is then placed

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.350 
marrow that we aspirate is then placed
in<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.770> refrigerated<00:03:04.770> container<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:06.210> then

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
in a refrigerated container and is then

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.650 
in a refrigerated container and is then
sent<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> company<00:03:07.260> where<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.730> placed

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
sent to the company where then is placed

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.410 
sent to the company where then is placed
into<00:03:10.140> their<00:03:10.970> bioreactor<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
into their bioreactor so that the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.650 
into their bioreactor so that the
appropriate<00:03:12.750> cells<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.710> grown<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.070> or

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
appropriate cells can be grown up or

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.510 
appropriate cells can be grown up or
made<00:03:15.660> into<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> larger<00:03:16.410> number<00:03:16.590> over<00:03:17.490> a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
made into a larger number over a

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.700 
made into a larger number over a
two-week<00:03:17.820> period<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:19.170> those<00:03:19.320> cells<00:03:19.560> are

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
two-week period and then those cells are

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.890 
two-week period and then those cells are
sent<00:03:20.010> back<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> us<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:21.150> injected<00:03:21.420> into<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
sent back to us to be injected into the
