00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello to all the guys who came in this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.189
 new part of pokémon heartgold e 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 this part we begin the rematch of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 super 4 in the pokémon league that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 wait a moment I want to see if 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 I have the necessary medicines but what the fuck 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.740
 done but yes yes I had taken with a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.800
 chip to make things a little easier for me later 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.460
 the adventure obviously then the first 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 super 4 will be pine we have already met 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.680
 one evening pokémon of a psycho type and we have 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.660
 a fight then obviously after the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.879
 first time we will have won the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 pokémon alloy we could risk it though 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.800
 this time they will now have pokémon 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.690
 much, much more powerful 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 now I don't know if they are the same 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 identical no they do not have them equal 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.559
 I think the same and chooses have a lot 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:06.240
 stronger now but here I don't know what 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:11.189
 use apple user surf pine ship psycho type 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 however I would have something to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:23.670
 ridley we are almost at the end of the ex 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 play the part where we will breathe 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.580
 the sample will be the last part of the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.540
 play however 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.960
 there will be extra parts I hope for 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.050
 which for example we will capture famous o 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 arceus the problem or even the brass not 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.660
 I never showed how to capture the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.660
 brass but I'll show it 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.110
 the problem is that I tried to activate 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.840
 the event is there or if the event selvi e in 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.040
 both 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.260
 when I press the lpr button on the emulator 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:10.990
 practically gives me a make me hunt 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:15.190
 I don't know why the emulator so I don't know 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.430
 if we do and the event series b is 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.440
 the arceus event if i can solve it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.850
 yes, I don't know how 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.340
 solve it if there is anyone in the comments 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.100
 that I can write a lot about it then 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 probably there will certainly be 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.420
 the event there is no slv we will keep them under 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.410
 in the form of an extra part of course 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.580
 extra part outside the bales tales play 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.230
 main then ok, an ex will be of 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 sure that of stone and non practice 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.410
 I never showed how to capture 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.410
 agrun pique with pork 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.660
 in short, however, we are at the end of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.130
 this the former play I remember that 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.860
 they had begun in August of the year 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.420
 last then because of a whole series of 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.010
 Stop pauses that stopped me not 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.950
 I felt more like continuing 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.840
 after a year not definitively 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:21.220
 finished after a year less 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.220
 fifteen days 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.840
 then slow bro we have no aces we have 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.840
 excel 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 I hope it is of state of yours both 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.670
 this was the pleasure of you the former 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.450
 play I say that I liked it 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.290
 very record why this game is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.769
 really like heartgold soulsilver was 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.819
 even for a long time I didn't play it 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.420
 I started it last year 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.849
 because I wanted to play in 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.209
 soul silver or accord but since 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:07.450
 I only had a silver on them with the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:12.849
 cartridge I wanted to do hardcourt for 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.470
 change its last pokémon status e 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.269
 even the highest level if 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.579
 I'm not mistaken, though, for using teeth 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:25.300
 for him faster news or psychic but 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.099
 it does nothing to me if you do n't watch looks 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:34.960
 it looks like a totem of those they used 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:38.639
 the ancients ok perfect ferrali gator 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.639
 I guess it goes up to 82 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:49.580
 ok perfect and we feel at the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.129
 next you match the superquadro here 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.259
 we will not even remember who I will remember anymore 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.789
 however it is not the next super 4 lo 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.789
 we will see in the next part hello
