00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
notes I would say but overall the music

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.029 
notes I would say but overall the music
actually<00:02:05.070> pops<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.880> sounds<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.479> bit

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
actually pops and sounds a little bit

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.520

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
Sennheiser cord is a good was that

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.110

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
these Sennheiser's are probably probably

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.910 
these Sennheiser's are probably probably
