00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 I believe that I work for two years and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 medium and the group has been made a lot 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 has worked under an idea that we believe 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.340
 that the fifth processor has believed and that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.580
 we as a group also see it 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.460
 worked and reflected in the past 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.380
 months of work and good today in the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.610
 world I'm seeing that idea is clear and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.610
 it is working very well 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.760
 it was something very unexpected for a lot of people 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.290
 we maybe not so much because 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.150
 we wanted to present and we dreamed and 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.440
 we believed in that but you have to be 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.210
 sincere not losing any match 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 winning without counting one against three 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.110
 world champions is is very good for 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 we are something a bit unexpected 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 also but good is a dream and now 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.879
 we want to live as much as possible 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.910
 good according to I've heard interviews and 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.530
 all these experts who have 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.880
 costa rica from six o'clock 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.780
 selections and been when football in 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.700
 this world 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.020
 that's smelling what we've done 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.550
 good job we have not thrown out for 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 back the opposite we shrink everything 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.160
 we can squeeze a lot and a lot 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.960
 part of the game when it does not open 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.790
 we go well and then we are again 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.229
 I think we are playing good football not 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.310
 I know if the place of the world cup to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.310
 yes yes good soccer 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.080
 and now we are in a stage in which 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.390
 you can not lose 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.190
 and good, we continue to get more and more 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.740
 there to qualify for the quarterfinals 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.600
 thanks to an opponent that is not going to be 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.120
 easy they won the eurocopa if a few 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.190
 years ago they are a very, very good team 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.930
 worked that is very well defended 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.450
 group well and counterattacks very well if I 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 I think it will not be easy but 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.660
 I think we have the ability to go to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.630
 give our best effort and fight 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.990
 all together to know how to get this 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 party ahead 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.330
 I am very happy for the World Cup that 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.369
 I have done the truth that I wanted to get in 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.250
 a moment I think you have invented 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.450
 well obviously one for more than there is 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.510
 done well things well always want 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.489
 more I also want to give more so much for 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.709
 help the group to move forward as 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.660
 to also do things well 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.880
 personally so I wait until the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.319
 next Sunday against Greece things 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.560
 they work well for me to favor the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.560
 group 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.720
 and we now know that the fans are 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.610
 totally on our side there are more than 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.890
 four million people supporting us 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.810
 in this beautiful task and everything at the same 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.040
 time but support for the action is 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.360
 important for us we want 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.040
 tell them that we are going to give our 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.470
 better effort than next Sunday 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.230
 let's die on the court to achieve 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.150
 a historical classification to quarters of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.590
 I know that everyone dreams of being 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.129
 just like us and we will see our 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.129
 effort
