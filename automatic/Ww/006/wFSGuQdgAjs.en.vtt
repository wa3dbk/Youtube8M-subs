okay this is a fifth time I've done this
mainly<00:00:06.750> because<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.859> get<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.309> camera

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
mainly because I can get the camera

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.749 
mainly because I can get the camera
angle<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.170> place<00:00:10.530> or<00:00:10.830> by<00:00:11.130> taking<00:00:11.429> it

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
angle at the right place or by taking it

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.020 
angle at the right place or by taking it
for<00:00:12.000> me<00:00:12.170> but<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.700> non-working<00:00:14.700> end

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for me but I have the non-working end

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.230 
for me but I have the non-working end
over<00:00:15.330> hand<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.520> take<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> working<00:00:18.090> in

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
over hand like this take the working in

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.980 
over hand like this take the working in
and<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.539> an<00:00:18.690> x<00:00:18.869> over<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.410> hand<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
and make an x over your hand like that

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
and make an x over your hand like that
bring<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> back<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.100> back<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.340> your

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
bring that back around the back of your

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
bring that back around the back of your
hand<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.720> where<00:00:24.930> there's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> V<00:00:25.439> right

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
hand and see where there's a V right

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.070 
hand and see where there's a V right
there<00:00:26.960> take<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.349> put<00:00:28.949> your<00:00:29.160> working<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:30.080> sort

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
there take and put your working in sort

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.900 
there take and put your working in sort
of<00:00:31.109> goes<00:00:31.289> through<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> V

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.240 

and<00:00:36.330> make<00:00:36.570> sure<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.110> stays<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.860> center

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and make sure this stays in the center

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.810 
and make sure this stays in the center
there<00:00:38.490> and<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:43.100> that's<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.400> you've<00:00:44.580> done

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there and so that's all you've done

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.970 
there and so that's all you've done
really<00:00:45.150> is<00:00:46.610> do<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:49.830> almost

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
really is do that and you're almost

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
really is do that and you're almost
finished<00:00:50.400> believe<00:00:50.880> it<00:00:50.970> or<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.620> take<00:00:53.120> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
finished believe it or not take this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.229 
finished believe it or not take this
front<00:00:54.510> part<00:00:54.810> and<00:00:54.989> hold<00:00:55.200> on<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
front part and hold on to it and you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.780 
front part and hold on to it and you
have<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.600> loops<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.470> here<00:00:58.890> push<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
have two loops in the back here push the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.260 
have two loops in the back here push the
right-hand<00:01:00.239> loop<00:01:00.800> through<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.790> left-hand

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
right-hand loop through the left-hand

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.370 
right-hand loop through the left-hand
loop<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.300> working<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
loop and then take your working in and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
loop and then take your working in and
put<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.250> through<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.610> loop<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
put it through that loop there that it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.450 
put it through that loop there that it
was<00:01:09.690> formed<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.600> your

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
was formed and that's it you have your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.600 
was formed and that's it you have your
left<00:01:14.460> exit<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:19.369> put<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> over

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
left exit now if you want to put it over

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.100 
left exit now if you want to put it over
something<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> sliding<00:01:23.210> knot<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
something and make a sliding knot you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.859 
something and make a sliding knot you
just<00:01:25.410> tighten<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:27.090> slowly<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just tighten it up and go slowly at this

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.070 
just tighten it up and go slowly at this
don't<00:01:28.700> yank<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:31.940> cords<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.210> it'll<00:01:33.960> turn

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
don't yank on the cords and it'll turn

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.310 
don't yank on the cords and it'll turn
out<00:01:34.259> nice<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.619> symmetrical<00:01:35.570> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.020> too

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
out nice and symmetrical if you do too

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.680 
out nice and symmetrical if you do too
quickly<00:01:37.650> sometimes<00:01:38.100> you'll<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:39.119> something

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
quickly sometimes you'll get something

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.800 
quickly sometimes you'll get something
looks<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:40.050> little<00:01:40.229> weird<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> won't<00:01:42.479> tighten

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
looks a little weird and I won't tighten

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
looks a little weird and I won't tighten
it<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.289> much<00:01:43.319> as<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:45.500> need<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.190> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it as much as you need to to make it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
it as much as you need to to make it
stay<00:01:47.880> better<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.479> I'll<00:01:48.600> tighten<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.259> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
stay better but I'll tighten it so it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820 
stay better but I'll tighten it so it
looks<00:01:49.560> nice<00:01:50.869> yeah<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.319> I'm<00:01:52.440> done<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
looks nice yeah that's all I'm done is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.790 
looks nice yeah that's all I'm done is
finding<00:01:53.280> loose<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:54.330> loops<00:01:54.539> and<00:01:54.960> tighten

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
finding loose little loops and tighten

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.150 
finding loose little loops and tighten
them<00:01:56.119> that's<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.300> use<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> pair<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.929> pliers

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
them that's why I use a pair of pliers

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.809 
them that's why I use a pair of pliers
is<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.640> tighten<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> better<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.450> them

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
is you can tighten the better with them

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.930 
is you can tighten the better with them
now<00:02:02.819> hopefully<00:02:03.179> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.569> see<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.960> doing<00:02:04.170> this
