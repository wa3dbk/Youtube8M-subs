00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
how this works

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
how this works
so<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> Vizia<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> camera<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> allows<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so the Vizia the camera that allows to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
so the Vizia the camera that allows to
take<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.829> specific<00:01:59.399> photos<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.750> can

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
take very specific photos and you can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.649 
take very specific photos and you can
track<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.439> over<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
track it over time and so we use it to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.539 
track it over time and so we use it to
track<00:02:04.079> deep<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.530> hyperpigmentation<00:02:04.920> as

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
track deep into hyperpigmentation as

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
track deep into hyperpigmentation as
well<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.880> fine<00:02:06.119> lines<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.509> wrinkles<00:02:06.689> and

well as fine lines and wrinkles and
redness<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> patient<00:02:08.610> who

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
redness and this is the patient who

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
redness and this is the patient who
started<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.239> cheat<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.750> makeup<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.289> could

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
started out cheat on makeup you could

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.370 
started out cheat on makeup you could
tell<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.619> she<00:02:10.739> hasn't<00:02:10.920> anything<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.670> on

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
tell that she hasn't anything going on

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.660 
tell that she hasn't anything going on
then<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:12.680> UV<00:02:12.920> light<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.160> can<00:02:13.280> see<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.490> deep

then with UV light you can see the deep
pigmentation<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.600> then<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.590> treated<00:02:16.430> her

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
pigmentation and then we treated her

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.460

vitamin<00:02:18.980> A<00:02:19.100> product<00:02:19.490> like<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> retinol<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
vitamin A product like a retinol and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.390 
vitamin A product like a retinol and
then<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:20.900> added<00:02:21.110> some<00:02:21.260> additional<00:02:21.770> peels<00:02:22.100> and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
then we added some additional peels and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.160 
then we added some additional peels and
really<00:02:22.880> significantly<00:02:23.450> improved<00:02:23.810> her<00:02:23.930> skin

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
really significantly improved her skin

skin is really improving we're getting

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.610 
skin is really improving we're getting
it<00:02:49.730> healthier<00:02:50.300> rather<00:02:50.900> than<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.320> making<00:02:51.530> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
it healthier rather than just making it

it healthier rather than just making it
look<00:02:51.710> better<00:02:51.830> but<00:02:52.190> even<00:02:52.460> if<00:02:52.580> you're<00:02:52.700> not<00:02:52.790> a

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
patient you can come in and get this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
patient you can come in and get this
done<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.460> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.700> see<00:02:55.940> where<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.480> stand

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
so we use it both in clinical trials for

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.370 
so we use it both in clinical trials for
PC<00:02:59.000> skin<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.450> we<00:02:59.540> also<00:02:59.690> use<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.050> within<00:03:00.170> my

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
PC skin and we also use it within my

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.990 
PC skin and we also use it within my
practice<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.340> someone<00:03:01.580> comes<00:03:01.700> into<00:03:01.910> my

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
practice so if someone comes into my

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.460 
practice so if someone comes into my
office<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.510> they<00:03:02.570> get<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> treatment<00:03:03.170> done

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
office and they get a treatment done

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.200 
office and they get a treatment done
with<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:03.860> petition<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:04.520> also<00:03:04.670> take<00:03:04.910> pictures

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
with the petition we also take pictures

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.090 
with the petition we also take pictures
with<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.420> Vizia<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.290> basically<00:03:06.740> do

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
with the Vizia and you can basically do

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.290 
with the Vizia and you can basically do
the<00:03:07.190> same<00:03:07.220> thing<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.610> do<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.760> clinical

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
the same thing we do with clinical

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.480 
the same thing we do with clinical
trials<00:03:08.570> at<00:03:08.660> pca<00:03:08.960> with<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.620> own<00:03:09.770> skin<00:03:10.070> how

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
much is the camera so when we do a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.610

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that process and so there speaking of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.810 
that process and so there speaking of
treatments<00:03:18.350> we<00:03:18.470> decided<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> show<00:03:19.610> off<00:03:19.790> a
