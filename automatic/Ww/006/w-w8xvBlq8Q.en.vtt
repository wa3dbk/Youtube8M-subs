00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.679 
working out this formation as I
mentioned<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> million<00:01:23.310> times<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
mentioned it a million times it is a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
mentioned it a million times it is a
very<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.590> call<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> ratty<00:01:26.189> formation

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
very I would call it a ratty formation

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
very I would call it a ratty formation
but<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.140> really

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
but it's just really because it's really

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.539 
but it's just really because it's really
really<00:01:28.680> strong<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.250> playing<00:01:29.400> these

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
really strong when you're playing these

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.480 
really strong when you're playing these
lower<00:01:29.759> divisions<00:01:30.680> people<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:31.890> terrible

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
lower divisions people make terrible

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.280 
lower divisions people make terrible
terrible<00:01:32.820> defensive<00:01:33.360> errors<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
terrible defensive errors and it's just

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
terrible defensive errors and it's just
really<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.619> easy<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> exploit<00:01:35.549> those

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
really really easy to exploit those

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.789 
really really easy to exploit those
errors<00:01:36.000> Korea<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.689> through<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
errors Korea getting through and that is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
errors Korea getting through and that is
a<00:01:37.829> wonderful<00:01:38.250> spinning<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> even<00:01:39.659> better

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
a wonderful spinning and even better

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
a wonderful spinning and even better
sliding<00:01:40.950> finish<00:01:41.280> puts<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.579> away<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.000> near

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
sliding finish puts it away at the near

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
sliding finish puts it away at the near
post<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> sus<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.189> movement

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
post and that's when I sus that movement

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.960 
post and that's when I sus that movement
that<00:01:45.450> natural<00:01:45.899> instinct<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.070> closest<00:01:47.820> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that natural instinct the closest of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.569 
that natural instinct the closest of
that<00:01:48.119> spin<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.770> good<00:01:50.009> things<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that spin these are all good things and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840 
that spin these are all good things and
I<00:01:50.640> thought<00:01:50.850> hmm<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:52.470> might<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.890> ourselves<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I thought hmm we might have ourselves a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
I thought hmm we might have ourselves a
player<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.210> could<00:01:54.630> stick<00:01:54.960> around<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
player that could stick around in this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.700 
player that could stick around in this
squad<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> little<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.689> long<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.619> bit

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
squad for a little or a long little bit

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.209 
squad for a little or a long little bit
of<00:01:58.829> time<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.079> obviously<00:02:01.079> he<00:02:01.200> gets<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.439> mazing

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
of time so obviously he gets a mazing

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
of time so obviously he gets a mazing
