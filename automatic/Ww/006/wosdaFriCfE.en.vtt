00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
later under that same menu when you have

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.430 
later under that same menu when you have
video<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.170> watch

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.600 

you<00:03:31.070> will<00:03:31.220> see<00:03:31.490> a<00:03:31.520> little<00:03:32.170> video<00:03:33.170> icon<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.550> you

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
you will see a little video icon so you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.240 
you will see a little video icon so you
can<00:03:34.970> press<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> Texas<00:03:36.770> wildfires

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and then you have another video button

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.110 
and then you have another video button
so<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> two-step<00:03:39.920> process<00:03:40.130> which<00:03:40.850> kind<00:03:41.060> of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
so it's a two-step process which kind of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.580 
so it's a two-step process which kind of
sucks<00:03:41.330> but<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.810> know<00:03:41.900> we'll<00:03:42.200> get<00:03:42.320> used<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
sucks but you know we'll get used to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.970 
sucks but you know we'll get used to
that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
that

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's not a nice you can also so you can

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.540

flip through them if you just swipe

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.360 
flip through them if you just swipe
horizontally<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:06.500> takes<00:04:06.710> a<00:04:06.800> second<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.190> load

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370
