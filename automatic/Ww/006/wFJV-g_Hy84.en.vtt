00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.929 

so<00:00:01.530> let<00:00:01.709> let's<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.280> about<00:00:02.399> what's<00:00:02.669> new<00:00:02.820> on

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
so let let's talk about what's new on

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.490 
so let let's talk about what's new on
the<00:00:03.030> software<00:00:03.360> side<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.629> things<00:00:03.750> so<00:00:04.140> obviously

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the software side of things so obviously

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.539 
the software side of things so obviously
we're<00:00:04.680> looking<00:00:04.890> at<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> t-mobile<00:00:05.400> version

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we're looking at the t-mobile version

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.120 
we're looking at the t-mobile version
again<00:00:06.170> and<00:00:07.170> let's<00:00:07.410> start<00:00:07.560> off<00:00:07.710> really<00:00:07.890> with

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
again and let's start off really with

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.500 
again and let's start off really with
just<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> lock<00:00:08.610> screen<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.150> at<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> lock

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
just the lock screen so at the lock

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.270 
just the lock screen so at the lock
screen<00:00:09.660> obviously<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.440> these<00:00:10.590> these

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
screen obviously we have these these

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
screen obviously we have these these
buttons<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.469> and<00:00:13.469> what<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
buttons down here and what we can do is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.790 
buttons down here and what we can do is
drag<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.610> into<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> center<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.350> launch<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
drag them into the center to launch the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
drag them into the center to launch the
application<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.970> if<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.180> come<00:00:18.390> back<00:00:18.420> here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
application so like if I come back here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
application so like if I come back here
I<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.859> quickly<00:00:20.070> launch<00:00:20.400> camera<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.119> example

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I can quickly launch camera for example

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
I can quickly launch camera for example
just<00:00:21.720> by<00:00:21.840> quickly<00:00:22.170> dragging<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.310> ring

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
just by quickly dragging into the ring

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.060 
just by quickly dragging into the ring
and<00:00:24.480> that's<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.650> nice<00:00:25.800> way<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and that's that's a really nice way of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.189 
and that's that's a really nice way of
just<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.699> reducing<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
just you know reducing some of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.870 
just you know reducing some of the
friction<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> most<00:00:29.369> frequented

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
friction to get into the most frequented

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
friction to get into the most frequented
applications<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> change<00:00:32.160> these

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
applications and you can change these

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.299 
applications and you can change these
you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.120> manually<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.309> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you know manually if you like to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
you know manually if you like to
basically<00:00:35.579> whatever<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.000> want<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.450> by

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
basically whatever you want and by

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.830 
basically whatever you want and by
default<00:00:37.200> they're<00:00:37.620> sort<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> same<00:00:38.129> thing

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
default they're sort of the same thing

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
default they're sort of the same thing
except<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> believe<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> mail<00:00:41.040> instead

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
except I believe they have mail instead

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
except I believe they have mail instead
of<00:00:41.610> gmail<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> other<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> other

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of gmail so the other the other

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
of gmail so the other the other
component<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> lock<00:00:45.120> screen<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
component of the lock screen is that you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.459 
component of the lock screen is that you
have<00:00:45.899> sort<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> custom<00:00:47.870> background<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.200> in

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
have sort of a custom background so in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
have sort of a custom background so in
this<00:00:49.950> example<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.520> using<00:00:50.550> weather<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.110> get

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this example I'm using weather so i get

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
this example I'm using weather so i get
i<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:52.739> sort<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.250> animation<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> turned

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
i got sort of an animation when I turned

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.869 
i got sort of an animation when I turned
on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.570> phone<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.550> weather<00:00:56.699> report

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
on the phone and the weather report

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
on the phone and the weather report
there<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.870> other<00:00:57.960> ones<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> go

weather stocks more clocks if you really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
weather stocks more clocks if you really
want<00:01:22.110> addition<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> digital<00:01:23.369> clock<00:01:23.729> at

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
want addition to the digital clock at

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
want addition to the digital clock at
the<00:01:23.970> top<00:01:24.150> an<00:01:24.420> actual<00:01:24.810> analog<00:01:25.170> clock<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the top an actual analog clock but if I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.840 
the top an actual analog clock but if I
come<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:28.470> whether<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:29.670> tap

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
come back here for to whether my tap

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.980 
come back here for to whether my tap
settings<00:01:31.670> are<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
settings are we do that you can just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
settings are we do that you can just
change<00:01:34.140> any<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.530> by<00:01:34.710> tapping<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.220> them

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
change any of these by tapping on them

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
change any of these by tapping on them
then<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> list<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:37.229> your

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
then you get a list of all your

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
then you get a list of all your
applications<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.479> put

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
applications that you can you know put

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.850 
applications that you can you know put
them<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> run

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
them in there like if I want to run

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
them in there like if I want to run
benchmark<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:42.740> every<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.189> launch<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
benchmark I every time that I launch it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.530 
benchmark I every time that I launch it
instead<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.939> messages<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.780> fine<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
instead of messages that's fine so I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.179 
instead of messages that's fine so I
think<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:49.049> interesting<00:01:49.530> new<00:01:49.649> concept

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.260 

there's<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.670> everybody<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there's something I see everybody do as

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
there's something I see everybody do as
soon<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:55.049> pick<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> phone

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
soon as they actually pick up the phone

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.330 
soon as they actually pick up the phone
is<00:01:56.450> do<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.630> ring<00:01:57.930> animation<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.070> obviously

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
is do this ring animation so obviously

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
is do this ring animation so obviously
the<00:01:59.520> new<00:01:59.670> home<00:02:00.360> screen<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.020> sort<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the new home screen thing is sort of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.459 
the new home screen thing is sort of
continuous<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.540> reminds<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.110> much

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
continuous and this reminds me very much

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.469 
continuous and this reminds me very much
of<00:02:04.619> compiz<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:05.880> familiar<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.270> you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of compiz on if you're familiar with you

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.900 
of compiz on if you're familiar with you
bun<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> compiz<00:02:07.380> fusion<00:02:07.819> this<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
bun to and compiz fusion this is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.609 
bun to and compiz fusion this is
essentially<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> cube<00:02:09.750> switcher<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.410> just

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
essentially the cube switcher but just

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.940 
essentially the cube switcher but just
you<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.370> HTC<00:02:11.910> songs<00:02:12.180> decided<00:02:12.780> they

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
you know like HTC songs decided they

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.119 
you know like HTC songs decided they
wanted<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.250> add<00:02:13.310> at<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.580> sense<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.950> then

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
wanted to add at this sense and then

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.250 
wanted to add at this sense and then
another<00:02:16.970> small<00:02:17.510> thing<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.170> now

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
another small thing is that you can now

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.660 
another small thing is that you can now
rearrange<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:18.860> these<00:02:18.980> home<00:02:19.129> screen<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.580> if

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
rearrange all these home screen so if

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.180 
rearrange all these home screen so if
you<00:02:19.790> zoom<00:02:20.060> out<00:02:20.450> long<00:02:20.780> press<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.890> know<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.040> can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
you zoom out long press you know you can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.890 
you zoom out long press you know you can
reorder<00:02:22.370> these<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.180> want<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.510> one<00:02:23.569> over

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
reorder these so if I want this one over

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.259 
reorder these so if I want this one over
here<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.650> done<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.879> one<00:02:26.060> over<00:02:26.239> here

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
here you know done this one over here

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.759 
here you know done this one over here
just<00:02:27.110> long<00:02:27.319> tab<00:02:27.849> move<00:02:28.849> over<00:02:28.940> done<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.650> that's

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
just long tab move over done so that's

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.720 
just long tab move over done so that's
that's<00:02:31.099> another<00:02:31.400> small<00:02:31.790> thing<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.340> big

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that's another small thing kind of a big

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.490 
that's another small thing kind of a big
thing<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.000> everybody<00:02:35.630> does<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.930> custom<00:02:36.260> roms

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
thing that everybody does in custom roms

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.070 
thing that everybody does in custom roms
that<00:02:36.830> they're<00:02:36.950> finally<00:02:37.099> implementing<00:02:37.790> is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that they're finally implementing is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.350 
that they're finally implementing is
quick<00:02:39.080> settings<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:40.099> know<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:40.940> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
quick settings so you know and it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.789 
quick settings so you know and it
doesn't<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.379> this<00:02:42.530> implementation

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
doesn't and this in this implementation

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.949 
doesn't and this in this implementation
actually<00:02:43.640> take<00:02:43.819> up<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.120> notification<00:02:44.810> area

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
actually take up your notification area

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.780 
actually take up your notification area
some<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> top<00:02:46.099> you<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> list<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
some of the top you have a list of the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030 
some of the top you have a list of the
applications<00:02:47.420> we've<00:02:47.660> recently<00:02:47.870> launched<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
applications we've recently launched and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.500 
applications we've recently launched and
if<00:02:49.130> i<00:02:49.220> add<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.519> than<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.819> can<00:02:49.940> drag<00:02:50.120> back<00:02:50.330> and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
if i add more than you can drag back and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.600 
if i add more than you can drag back and
forth<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.799> if<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.980> come<00:02:52.160> down<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.430> quick

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
forth and if you come down to quick

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.819 
forth and if you come down to quick
settings<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:53.989> do<00:02:54.170> things<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.470> toggle

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
settings you can do things like toggle

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.710 
settings you can do things like toggle
Wi-Fi<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.280> hotspot<00:02:56.030> mobile<00:02:56.450> network

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
Wi-Fi the hotspot mobile network

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.400 
Wi-Fi the hotspot mobile network
bluetooth<00:02:57.709> gps<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.660> quickly<00:02:59.930> dive<00:03:00.200> into

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
bluetooth gps and then quickly dive into

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.410 
bluetooth gps and then quickly dive into
a<00:03:00.500> task<00:03:00.769> manager<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.060> mean<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.239> would<00:03:02.329> be

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
a task manager so I mean it would be

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.360 
a task manager so I mean it would be
nice<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.750> see<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.560> know<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.769> option<00:03:04.099> for

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
nice to see you know the option for

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.920 
nice to see you know the option for
example<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.120> know<00:03:05.329> change<00:03:05.630> screen

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
example you know change screen

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.890 
example you know change screen
brightness<00:03:06.170> or<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.860> airplane<00:03:07.250> mode<00:03:07.430> here

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
brightness or like airplane mode here

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.030 
brightness or like airplane mode here
but<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.170> know<00:03:09.260> obviously<00:03:09.410> those<00:03:09.799> might<00:03:10.010> be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
but you know obviously those might be

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680 
but you know obviously those might be
things<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.670> going<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.880> come<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.209> HTC

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
things that are going to come with HTC

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.860 
things that are going to come with HTC
dev<00:03:12.250> etc<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.150> into<00:03:14.269> for<00:03:14.810> example

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
dev etc but if you go into for example

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.479 
dev etc but if you go into for example
their<00:03:15.260> task<00:03:15.500> manager<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.069> actually<00:03:16.340> pretty

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
their task manager it's actually pretty

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.280 
their task manager it's actually pretty
nice<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.880> get<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.030> list<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.569> applications

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
nice you get a list of the applications

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.199 
nice you get a list of the applications
that<00:03:18.410> are<00:03:18.530> open<00:03:18.709> how<00:03:19.549> much<00:03:19.700> memory<00:03:19.940> they're

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
that are open how much memory they're

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.559 
that are open how much memory they're
using<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:21.920> can<00:03:22.069> close<00:03:22.280> them<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:23.480> know

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
using and you can close them you know

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.910 
using and you can close them you know
just<00:03:23.720> from<00:03:23.840> here<00:03:25.030> pretty<00:03:26.030> easily<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> mean

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
just from here pretty easily so I mean

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.620 
just from here pretty easily so I mean
that's<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.130> sort<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.370> small<00:03:28.639> thing<00:03:28.910> if<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
that's a sort of small thing if you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.030 
that's a sort of small thing if you
already<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> task<00:03:30.139> manager<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.769> doesn't

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
already have a task manager it doesn't

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.210 
already have a task manager it doesn't
really<00:03:31.130> matter<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:32.569> huge<00:03:32.810> clock<00:03:33.220> widget

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
really matter the huge clock widget

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.640 
really matter the huge clock widget
that's<00:03:34.910> got<00:03:35.209> some<00:03:35.420> changes<00:03:35.840> there's<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.470> nice

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that's got some changes there's a nice

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.479 
that's got some changes there's a nice
weather<00:03:37.600> thing<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.780> pops<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:39.139> now<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:40.340> can

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
weather thing that pops up now you can

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.449 
weather thing that pops up now you can
dive<00:03:40.670> further<00:03:41.060> inside<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.769> sort<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.220> you

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
dive further inside and sort of get you

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.099 
dive further inside and sort of get you
know<00:03:43.549> like<00:03:43.579> a<00:03:43.670> view<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.510> additional

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
know like a view with the additional

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.400 
know like a view with the additional
information<00:03:45.620> about<00:03:45.739> now<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:47.299> think<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.019> hourly

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
information about now I think the hourly

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
information about now I think the hourly
view<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.769> kind<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.069> cool<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.790> get<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.000> graph<00:03:50.299> of

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
view is kind of cool you get a graph of

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.900 
view is kind of cool you get a graph of
temperature<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:52.250> can<00:03:52.370> see<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:52.609> going<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.760> be

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
temperature you can see it's going to be

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.629 
temperature you can see it's going to be
like<00:03:53.799> 107<00:03:54.799> tomorrow<00:03:56.290> tap<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.440> five<00:03:57.709> day<00:03:57.920> you

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
like 107 tomorrow tap on five day you

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.009 
like 107 tomorrow tap on five day you
know<00:03:58.730> it's<00:03:58.970> sort<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.180> self-explanatory<00:03:59.389> but

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
know it's sort of self-explanatory but

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.390 
know it's sort of self-explanatory but
it's<00:04:00.230> just<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.530> know<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.650> small<00:04:00.980> thing<00:04:01.220> that's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
it's just you know a small thing that's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.940 
it's just you know a small thing that's
gotten<00:04:01.609> an<00:04:01.819> enhancement<00:04:02.709> compared<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.799> where

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
gotten an enhancement compared to where

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.580 
gotten an enhancement compared to where
things<00:04:04.190> were<00:04:04.400> with<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.970> HTC<00:04:05.750> Sense<00:04:06.109> two<00:04:06.349> point

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
things were with the HTC Sense two point

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.080 
things were with the HTC Sense two point
oh<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:09.349> other<00:04:09.440> next<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.130> launcher<00:04:10.669> so<00:04:10.970> on

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
oh the other next is the launcher so on

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.430 
oh the other next is the launcher so on
the<00:04:11.180> launcher<00:04:11.510> now<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.810> have<00:04:12.019> these<00:04:12.169> three

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the launcher now you have these three

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.009 
the launcher now you have these three
things<00:04:12.470> at<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:12.889> bottom<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.540> course<00:04:14.540> favorites

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
things at the bottom of course favorites

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.680 
things at the bottom of course favorites
I<00:04:15.290> think<00:04:15.859> frequents<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.609> based<00:04:17.479> on<00:04:17.599> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
I think frequents so based on the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.420 
I think frequents so based on the
frequency<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:18.109> when<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.380> look<00:04:18.530> tap<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.190> things

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
frequency of when you look tap on things

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.729 
frequency of when you look tap on things
here<00:04:19.519> they'll<00:04:20.329> be<00:04:20.389> populated<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.229> sorted<00:04:21.590> by

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
here they'll be populated and sorted by

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.870 
here they'll be populated and sorted by
the<00:04:21.799> frequency<00:04:22.570> and

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
the frequency and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.080 
the frequency and
loaded<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.860> just<00:04:26.040> three<00:04:26.220> different<00:04:26.520> views<00:04:26.790> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
loaded so just three different views of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.060 
loaded so just three different views of
course<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.170> sort<00:04:28.440> them<00:04:28.560> different<00:04:28.950> ways

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
course you can sort them different ways

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.630 
course you can sort them different ways
you<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.120> by<00:04:32.180> date<00:04:33.200> alphabetical<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.340> date

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
you know by date alphabetical and date

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.910 
you know by date alphabetical and date
the<00:04:35.760> other<00:04:35.790> way<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:37.530> those<00:04:37.680> are<00:04:37.710> pretty

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
the other way so those are pretty

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.320 
the other way so those are pretty
self-explanatory<00:04:40.610> next<00:04:41.610> thing<00:04:41.760> up<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.090> that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
self-explanatory next thing up is that

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.440 
self-explanatory next thing up is that
HTC<00:04:42.750> has<00:04:42.870> sort<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.230> made<00:04:43.740> their<00:04:43.950> own<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.490> swype

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
HTC has sort of made their own a swype

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.930 
HTC has sort of made their own a swype
keyboard<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.860> if<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.520> bring<00:04:47.700> up<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
keyboard so if you if you bring up the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.000 
keyboard so if you if you bring up the
keyboard<00:04:48.090> course<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.020> HTC's<00:04:49.530> default

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
keyboard course this is HTC's default

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.000 
keyboard course this is HTC's default
Miami<00:04:50.490> keyboard<00:04:51.260> which<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:52.620> know<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:52.950> a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
Miami keyboard which you know for a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.740 
Miami keyboard which you know for a
while<00:04:53.130> everybody<00:04:53.610> was<00:04:53.730> a<00:04:53.790> huge<00:04:54.060> fan<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.300> now<00:04:54.720> i

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
while everybody was a huge fan of now i

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.090 
while everybody was a huge fan of now i
think<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.080> gingerbread<00:04:55.590> keyboard<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.070> a

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
think the gingerbread keyboard is a

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.160 
think the gingerbread keyboard is a
little<00:04:56.280> bit<00:04:56.370> better<00:04:56.510> at<00:04:57.510> least<00:04:57.660> that's<00:04:57.870> become

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
little bit better at least that's become

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.080 
little bit better at least that's become
my<00:04:58.200> my<00:04:58.740> personal<00:04:59.190> favorite<00:04:59.550> but<00:04:59.700> if<00:04:59.790> you<00:04:59.910> want

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.420 
my my personal favorite but if you want
to<00:05:00.180> use<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.450> HTC<00:05:00.900> keyboard<00:05:01.080> which<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.770> you

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
to use the HTC keyboard which is you

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.390

know gotten its own change you can now

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.120 
know gotten its own change you can now
basically<00:05:05.730> swipe<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:07.530> literally<00:05:07.890> just

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
basically swipe so it literally just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.900 
basically swipe so it literally just
works<00:05:08.310> like<00:05:08.520> swype<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.240> dte<00:05:09.900> CH<00:05:10.910> of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
works like swype and and dte CH of

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.300 
works like swype and and dte CH of
course<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.180> doesn't<00:05:12.300> really<00:05:12.510> know<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:12.690> non-tech

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
course it doesn't really know a non-tech

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.180 
course it doesn't really know a non-tech
but<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.430> course<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.670> can<00:05:14.850> still<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.330> know<00:05:16.190> you

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
but of course you can still you know you

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.070 
but of course you can still you know you
know<00:05:17.280> touch<00:05:17.490> type<00:05:17.730> as<00:05:17.910> well<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:19.770> works

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
know touch type as well and that works

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.110 
know touch type as well and that works
but<00:05:22.080> yeah<00:05:22.290> there's<00:05:22.710> they<00:05:23.040> call<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.430> trace<00:05:23.820> if

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
but yeah there's they call it trace if

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.200 
but yeah there's they call it trace if
you<00:05:24.270> come<00:05:24.480> in<00:05:24.600> hearing<00:05:24.840> settings<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:26.670> putting

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
you come in hearing settings and putting

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.310 
you come in hearing settings and putting
keyboards<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.230> put<00:05:28.530> language<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.040> keyboard

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320

keyboards and put language and keyboard
touch<00:05:31.320> input<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:32.310> can<00:05:32.460> see<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.730> they<00:05:32.820> call

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
touch input you can see that they call

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.240 
touch input you can see that they call
it<00:05:33.150> trace<00:05:33.620> trace<00:05:34.620> keyboard<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.860> yeah<00:05:37.980> works

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
it trace trace keyboard but yeah works

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.440 
it trace trace keyboard but yeah works
effectively<00:05:38.520> just<00:05:39.090> like<00:05:39.270> sent<00:05:39.570> on<00:05:39.810> swype
