00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.070
 Chris 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.910
 This story 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.330
 Over the weekend 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.100
 You should know that it is now illegal 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.159
 Back on Saturday 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.710
 Two lock on your cell phone 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.160
 Yeah 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.310
 It seems that the Library of Congress is not exactly why but support 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.129
 In a report ... a library that identifies exemptions 

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.820
 To Digital Copyright Law m 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 And 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.729
 For some reason the library decided to uh ... 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.060
 Open your mobile phone 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.250
 It says that if you bought an entity in the phone 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.730
 IPhone 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.030
 What about the contract I decided to go to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.000
 I use some Dunlop machine so I can call that picture at T-Mobile T 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.640
 Or whatever it is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.110
 Uh ... is illegal 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.220
 Now if you already lock on your phone where you have purchased you 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.400
 Buy the phone unlocked 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.540
 Then you're fine 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.390
 But if you are unlocked yourself 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.930
 You are subject to you 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 Somewhat harsh 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.120
 Or ... scenes of punishment 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.230
 Right means you can go to prison you'd like five hundred was five 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.280
 $ 100,000 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.930
 Fine Wah ... I do not know what it is and it's good that how crazy 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 Prove if it is legal to have it on my phone just do not think open it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.510
 They will have how to go to your records and I do not know 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.220
 Until now 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 I'm not very clear and I'm sure they'll come I'm sure they'll involve learning 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.800
 Kind of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.320
 Face recognition or UAV technology 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.020
 Nothing ridiculous but this is just an example of 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 By tightening the screws of the corporate monster 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.550
 and it's enough 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.060
 I want to cast a speculative appeal here but I wonder if I would love to see 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.650
 what do you know 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.660
 It has taken the World Library of Congress recently from the debtor 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 Jamie Break 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.619
 What did you say and lost my phone? I lost my phone and then everyone appeared 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.859
 Away 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:11.799
 And present 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.839
 Uh ... so this is ridiculous but to hope there could be some kind of 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:21.019
 Uh ... uh ... Congress work on this I do not know if there will be doing 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.930
 It seems quite ridiculous though
