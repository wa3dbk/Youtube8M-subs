00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:19.919 
throttle book the original twist

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.529 
throttle book the original twist
throttle<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.810> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:23.029> potentially<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> think

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
throttle and this is potentially I think

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.589 
throttle and this is potentially I think
this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> problem<00:00:25.230> main<00:00:25.529> problem<00:00:25.950> why

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
this is the problem main problem why

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.159 
this is the problem main problem why
well<00:00:28.130> like<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.790> I<00:00:30.119> saw<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.450> another<00:00:30.630> YouTube

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
well like I'm I saw in another YouTube

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.040 
well like I'm I saw in another YouTube
video<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:31.649> this<00:00:31.829> guy<00:00:32.480> inside<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.719> metal

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
video by this guy inside the metal

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.400 
video by this guy inside the metal
casing<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> goes<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:36.410> there's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
casing that goes over this there's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
casing that goes over this there's
little<00:00:37.829> dig<00:00:38.160> outs<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.780> dig<00:00:39.989> outs

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
little dig outs and I think the dig outs

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
little dig outs and I think the dig outs
to<00:00:40.590> off<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> cable<00:00:41.250> because<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> opened

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to off the cable because when I opened

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750 
to off the cable because when I opened
up<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.470> see<00:00:43.710> why<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:44.070> throttle<00:00:44.490> wouldn't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
up this to see why my throttle wouldn't

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.730 
up this to see why my throttle wouldn't
look<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:45.240> what<00:00:45.870> I'll<00:00:45.990> thinking<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.590> goes

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
look that what I'll thinking that goes

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.580 
look that what I'll thinking that goes
right<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.290> goes

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
right there you know thing that goes

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
right there you know thing that goes
right<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.490> goes<00:00:50.700> around<00:00:50.880> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
right there and then goes around that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.900 
right there and then goes around that
completely<00:00:52.530> booked<00:00:52.920> off<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> cable<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
completely booked off the cable and the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.850 
completely booked off the cable and the
only<00:00:54.060> way<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.750> happened<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.440> if

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.960 

there's<00:00:58.860> something<00:00:59.160> show<00:00:59.400> from<00:00:59.610> there<00:00:59.790> that

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
there's something show from there that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.729 
there's something show from there that
bloke<00:01:00.270> said<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bloke said and I think that's the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
bloke said and I think that's the
problem<00:01:02.450> so<00:01:03.450> if<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.379> were<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.970> have

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
problem so if I were you and you have

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.280 
problem so if I were you and you have
the<00:01:06.509> Baja<00:01:06.960> Doodlebug<00:01:07.680> DB<00:01:08.610> 30<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.390> any<00:01:09.869> other

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the Baja Doodlebug DB 30 or any other

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.859 
the Baja Doodlebug DB 30 or any other
the<00:01:10.649> Baja's<00:01:11.040> products<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.329> have<00:01:12.509> this<00:01:12.659> type

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the Baja's products that have this type

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
the Baja's products that have this type
of<00:01:12.899> twist<00:01:13.229> throttle<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.490> open<00:01:14.789> that<00:01:14.969> up

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
of twist throttle I would open that up

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.120 
of twist throttle I would open that up
and<00:01:15.359> take<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.719> look<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.139> dig<00:01:16.439> out<00:01:16.619> those<00:01:16.859> what

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and take a look and dig out those what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.200 
and take a look and dig out those what
you<00:01:17.429> know<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> piece<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> sandpaper

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you know with the piece of sandpaper

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.419 
you know with the piece of sandpaper
your<00:01:18.749> drill<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.829> best<00:01:20.039> bet

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
your drill probably would be best bet

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.020 
your drill probably would be best bet
you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> take<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.630> drill<00:01:21.929> and<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.829> that<00:01:23.039> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you know take your drill and do that so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
you know take your drill and do that so
then<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:25.020> wait<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.799> yeah<00:01:25.950> then

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
then you don't have to wait so yeah then

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.069 
then you don't have to wait so yeah then
you<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.609> that<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.359> problem<00:01:27.539> as<00:01:27.899> I

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
you don't have that same problem as I

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.399 
you don't have that same problem as I
did<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.639> I<00:01:29.850> ordered<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.810> new
