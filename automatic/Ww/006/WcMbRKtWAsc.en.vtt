00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.960
At this moment the final groups

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.600
for the National Secondary Schools
Kapa Haka Competition

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.960
take the stage to vie for a place
in the finals tomorrow.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.600
Among Pool C is the top five
from the last competition.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.760
Te Karere followed
current title holders

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.760
Nga Taiatea Wharekura
as they try to make it a double.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.680
Back to the stage.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.720
We're exhilarated,
but now it's over.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.400
Current title-holders
Nga Taiatea Wharekura are back

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.600
hoping to repeat history.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.800
They've been practicing for a while,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.840
knowing that there's a lot
of pressure on them to do well.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.440
There's a lot of pressure,
but as long as we focus,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.200
it will all work out.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.120
But the group is also in mourning
after the death of a tutor's child

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
very recently.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520
The group was sad.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.080
We're grieving, as is the family,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.040
but we're supporting
each other like family.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.040
Three teams in this pool
have won the top title before,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.360
which is why it's been dubbed
the Pool of Death.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
The top five teams
of the last competition

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.720
also feature in their pool.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
This is the day.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.280
But there's only one goal.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:07.000
We want to achieve the hopes
and dreams our tutors had for us.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The top nine from the three pools
will be announced tonight,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
a first for this competition.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.720
Rapaera Tawhai, Te Karere.
