 Cozy it is professional though 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.070
 Nevertheless, so that you sometimes friends 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.370
 not win 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.250
 lambrasco aka pug has since become 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 Moschitz says goodbye to the sport 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.729

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.640
 at least and when the weather is not 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.009

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140

 it enjoys being there countries 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.899
 You can only win in equestrian sport 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.539
 together the rider with the horse and 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.819
 the right trainer for janne is jÃ¶rg 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.190
 nail the matching we are together 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.869
 starting with lambrasco 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.450
 tried by first team in 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.670
 Germany to come far and that is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.990
 us so I say once and for all 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.030
 succeeded on the way up is janne 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.880
 meyer again with new horses all 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.459
 Advance goya in hagen at the first 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.140
 station of the dkb-riders tour were the 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.690
 at a second week ago 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.119
 great price the scene talks about goya 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.300
 like raves when he I think 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.069
 really unlimited fortune and s2 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.349
 a big horse but he is whole 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.360
 sensitive and that is sometimes still 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.830
 the difficulty is sometimes one 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.519
 a bit of lousy boy sometimes is one 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.179
 wants a little 

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:12.379
 oh yes wonderful and a bit wild 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.849
 and janna emotional and ambitious 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.830
 mixing happens now she just has to 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.920
 then a real path will do that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 whole 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.430
 into the lanes direction success makes 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.190
 just this week of pause that has 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.410
 He also earned 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.540
 well since hugo yes means the way is 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.349
 free for jannis other athletes on the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.930
 way up 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.010
 with four hopes for the future she is after 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.310
 rhede vienna came 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.900
 Grace Lennox Carlotta and then I have 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.690
 another young horse brought cellar 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.830
 and corey hang on that especially because 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.830
 it is our own breed 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.930
 Grace had a quarter of a year 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.680
 injury break was talk of her 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.270
 reboot 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.160
 she is well and healthy again 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.110
 but we have been fit anyway 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.730
 taken off early in the year and are 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.590
 first very small exam ridden l 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.450
 and m just jump loose first 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.400
 come back in and that was now 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.720
 the first bigger occurs and that one 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.720
 already makes it easier when it works so well 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.459
 relief joy frustration jubilation janne 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 meyer is with you every step of the way 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.000
 full heart 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.170
 for the emotionality she experiences just 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 Sometimes you have to do that a bit 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.700
 slow down and sometimes you have to say that 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.700
 but now come in gear 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.070
 you're always a bit late for us 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.900
 have to get started now 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.270
 an athlete without emotions never gets involved 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.970
 you need star in equestrian sports already 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.790
 two emotional horses for the success and 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 actually even three if one rider 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.620
 No emotion has to do sport and 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.080
 do not chatter afterward then you are 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.239
 I do not think I'm a coach any more 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.130
 for the horses the sport in successful 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.920
 janne meyer to the tournament places this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.080
 world is talking about him she likes to come 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.180
 because she likes to do it in between 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.799
 has a bit cozy and am 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 dearest to the family on her 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.820
 successes may well come up with one 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.500
 glass of sparkling wine for themselves time so come 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.080
 Today my dad is here and has me 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.519
 visited and I will always ask what 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.269
 we can become so but I think 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.269
 it will still be a cable 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:21.430
 jana meier from successful days in 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.430
 Rhede 4 in a peak season 2015
