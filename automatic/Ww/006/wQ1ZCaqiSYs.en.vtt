strands out and I put a little bit a
little<00:00:49.469> bit<00:00:49.980> together<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.780> axis<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.770> cotton

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
little bit together to axis like cotton

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.020 
little bit together to axis like cotton
wool<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.379> got<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.890> tampon<00:00:56.520> which<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
wool and then I've got a tampon which is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
wool and then I've got a tampon which is
really<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.020> also<00:00:58.289> acts<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.100> cotton

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
wool but I've got I think there's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.500 
wool but I've got I think there's
something<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.870> 10<00:01:04.320> Manchester<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.299> that's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
something like 10 Manchester and that's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.170 
something like 10 Manchester and that's
really<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> they're<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.250> elastic<00:01:08.970> bands

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
really good and they're in elastic bands

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
really good and they're in elastic bands
which<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> also<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.850> I've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:13.100> an

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
which I can also use then I've got an

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
which I can also use then I've got an
elastic<00:01:14.490> band<00:01:14.939> cut<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.420> half<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.350> just

elastic band cut in half and then just

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.149 
elastic band cut in half and then just
loads<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.619> again<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
loads of not just over to there again to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.030 
loads of not just over to there again to
act<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> bull<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> end
