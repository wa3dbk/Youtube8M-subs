to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.080> fast<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:29.189> hot

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to do that fast is just to use hot

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.039 
to do that fast is just to use hot
rollers<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> could<00:01:30.540> also<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:30.990> with

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
rollers but you could also do this with

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.289 
rollers but you could also do this with
a<00:01:31.560> curling<00:01:31.890> iron<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.640> hair<00:01:32.820> scrunches

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a curling iron or if your hair scrunches

little bit of dimension as well and then

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
little bit of dimension as well and then
you're<00:02:05.220> gonna<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> section<00:02:05.930> just<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you're gonna take a section just the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
you're gonna take a section just the
side<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.830> closer<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.759> face<00:02:08.940> and

here<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.870> underneath<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.980> first<00:02:17.280> one

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
here and just underneath that first one

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
here and just underneath that first one
and<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:19.170> you're<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> repeat<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.860> same

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and then you're going to repeat the same

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.229 
and then you're going to repeat the same
thing<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> other<00:02:20.459> side<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
thing on the other side you just do this

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.360 
thing on the other side you just do this
section<00:02:21.660> directly<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> right<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
section directly to the right of the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.309 
section directly to the right of the
crown<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:23.850> head<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:24.989> about<00:02:25.170> an

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
crown of your head and that's about an

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.059 
crown of your head and that's about an
inch<00:02:25.440> section<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.160> believe<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.470> you're<00:02:28.980> gonna

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
inch section I believe and you're gonna

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.680 
inch section I believe and you're gonna
pin<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.550> place<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.239> can<00:02:30.270> see<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.630> I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
pin that in place and you can see that I

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.210 
pin that in place and you can see that I
pinned<00:02:30.930> these<00:02:31.050> straight<00:02:31.319> down<00:02:31.500> another<00:02:31.950> way

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
pinned these straight down another way

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.920 
pinned these straight down another way
if<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> hard<00:02:32.970> time<00:02:33.090> hiding<00:02:33.810> these

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
if you have a hard time hiding these

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.020 
if you have a hard time hiding these
pins<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.800> couple<00:02:35.400> little<00:02:35.610> twists

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
pins you can do a couple little twists

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.430 
pins you can do a couple little twists
like<00:02:36.209> twist<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.569> two<00:02:36.690> times<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.110> then<00:02:37.260> pin<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
like twist it two times and then pin it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.740 
like twist it two times and then pin it
makes<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.489> bit<00:02:38.670> easier<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.330> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
makes it a little bit easier just a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.240 
makes it a little bit easier just a
little<00:02:40.019> trick<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.380> throw<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.160> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
little trick to throw in there if you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.699 
little trick to throw in there if you
guys<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> use<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.380> then<00:02:43.590> we're

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
guys want to use that and then we're

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.140 
guys want to use that and then we're
gonna<00:02:43.830> start<00:02:44.069> creating<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.519> bottom<00:02:44.910> shape

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
gonna start creating this bottom shape

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180 
gonna start creating this bottom shape
you're<00:02:45.330> gonna<00:02:45.450> take<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> hair<00:02:46.110> from<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:47.010> in

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
front of the ear and pull it across the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.170 
front of the ear and pull it across the
nape<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.489> well<00:02:50.640> not<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> nape<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you're not kind of just below the crown

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
you're not kind of just below the crown
of<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.709> head<00:02:52.830> horizontally<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.660> is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
where we start making that shape and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.220 
where we start making that shape and
then<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.970> gonna<00:02:57.090> pin<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.540> place<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
then you're gonna pin it in place and

then you're gonna pin it in place and
then<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.160> want<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> take<00:03:02.489> an<00:03:02.610> identical

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.690 
then you want to take an identical
section<00:03:03.480> from<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> other<00:03:03.900> side<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.590> light<00:03:05.549> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
section from the other side and light it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
section from the other side and light it
up<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.180> underneath<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.720> previous<00:03:07.140> section

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
up just underneath the previous section

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160 
up just underneath the previous section
and<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.549> do<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.269> lining<00:03:09.930> up<00:03:10.019> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and as you do this with lining up the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.750 
and as you do this with lining up the
sections<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.650> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.010> create<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> cool

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
sections you kind of create a cool

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
sections you kind of create a cool
little<00:03:11.940> texture<00:03:12.540> here<00:03:12.840> because<00:03:13.500> whenever<00:03:13.920> you

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
little texture here because whenever you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.860 
little texture here because whenever you
finish<00:03:14.700> pinning<00:03:14.910> them<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.359> all<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> pins<00:03:15.690> are

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
finish pinning them and all the pins are

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.630 
finish pinning them and all the pins are
hidden<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.320> everything<00:03:16.709> then<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.310> have<00:03:17.459> that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
hidden and everything then you have that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.370 
hidden and everything then you have that
cool<00:03:17.880> little<00:03:18.180> basket

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
cool little basket

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.810 
cool little basket
texture<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.430> looks<00:03:20.670> really

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
texture to it and it looks really

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.099 
texture to it and it looks really
interesting<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.570> you're<00:03:24.660> gonna<00:03:24.780> repeat

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
interesting and then you're gonna repeat

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.990 
interesting and then you're gonna repeat
that<00:03:25.260> again<00:03:25.500> with<00:03:25.709> another<00:03:25.859> two<00:03:26.549> sections

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that again with another two sections

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.280 
that again with another two sections
you're<00:03:27.120> gonna<00:03:27.209> take<00:03:27.390> one<00:03:27.540> from<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.780> side<00:03:28.019> and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
you're gonna take one from the side and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.690 
you're gonna take one from the side and
again<00:03:28.410> that's<00:03:28.739> gonna<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.100> right<00:03:29.370> from<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
again that's gonna be right from the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.550 
again that's gonna be right from the
very<00:03:29.880> front<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.299> hairline<00:03:30.720> because<00:03:31.410> you

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
very front of the hairline because you

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.259 
very front of the hairline because you
want<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.799> encapsulate<00:03:32.010> all<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.820> hair<00:03:33.000> into

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
want to encapsulate all of the hair into

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.550 
want to encapsulate all of the hair into
this<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.750> don't<00:03:33.930> want<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.260> any<00:03:34.440> that's

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
this you don't want to have any that's

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.060 
this you don't want to have any that's
hanging<00:03:34.799> out<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.609> it's<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.000> creating<00:03:36.510> um

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
hanging out so it's kind of creating um

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.970 
hanging out so it's kind of creating um
my<00:03:38.070> almost<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> wrapped<00:03:39.989> ponytail<00:03:40.590> effect

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
my almost like a wrapped ponytail effect

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.650 
my almost like a wrapped ponytail effect
but<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.519> about<00:03:41.730> two<00:03:41.880> ponytail<00:03:42.239> if<00:03:42.450> that

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
but it's not about two ponytail if that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.569 
but it's not about two ponytail if that
makes<00:03:42.840> any<00:03:43.049> sense<00:03:43.079> at<00:03:43.350> all<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.739> then<00:03:44.340> you're

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
makes any sense at all and then you're

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.099 
makes any sense at all and then you're
gonna<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> exact<00:03:45.299> same<00:03:45.329> thing<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
gonna do the exact same thing on the

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.740 
gonna do the exact same thing on the
other<00:03:46.140> side<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:47.970> depending<00:03:48.329> on<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.600> hair

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
other side now depending on your hair

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.300 
other side now depending on your hair
you<00:03:48.780> might<00:03:49.079> want<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.350> do<00:03:49.470> more<00:03:49.620> sections<00:03:50.070> this

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
you might want to do more sections this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.069 
you might want to do more sections this
is<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:50.910> did<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.239> create<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> shape

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
is all that I did to create the shape

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.900 
is all that I did to create the shape
and<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.410> think<00:03:52.590> that's<00:03:52.769> really<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.340> sufficient

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
and I think that's really a sufficient

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.550 
and I think that's really a sufficient
number<00:03:54.000> honestly<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.079> find<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.380> you

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
number honestly but if you find that you

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.780 
number honestly but if you find that you
want<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.890> do<00:03:55.980> more<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.370> always<00:03:56.609> do<00:03:56.760> more

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
want to do more you can always do more

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.059 
want to do more you can always do more
but<00:03:57.569> for<00:03:57.690> your<00:03:57.840> very<00:03:58.049> last<00:03:58.350> section<00:03:58.709> what<00:03:58.980> you

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
but for your very last section what you

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.830 
but for your very last section what you
want<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.310> do<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.670> take<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.120> hair<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.420> just

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
want to do is take the hair that's just

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.050 
want to do is take the hair that's just
underneath<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:02.220> skirt<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.670> hair<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
underneath the skirt of the hair and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.670 
underneath the skirt of the hair and
bring<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.720> around<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.140> put<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.440> just

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
bring it around and put it just

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.259 
bring it around and put it just
underneath<00:04:05.040> again<00:04:05.310> because<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:05.970> don't<00:04:06.120> want

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
underneath again because you don't want

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:06.900 
underneath again because you don't want
to<00:04:06.359> pin<00:04:06.479> these<00:04:06.630> all

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
to pin these all

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.100 
to pin these all
hot<00:04:07.060> because<00:04:07.360> then<00:04:07.540> you'll<00:04:07.690> see<00:04:07.870> where<00:04:08.020> it

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
hot because then you'll see where it

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.630 
hot because then you'll see where it
starts<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.470> where<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.680> ends<00:04:08.860> so<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.310> want<00:04:09.520> to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
starts and where it ends so you want to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.950 
starts and where it ends so you want to
start<00:04:09.880> with<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.090> underneath<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.660> then<00:04:10.780> pin<00:04:10.930> it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
start with it underneath and then pin it

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.870 
start with it underneath and then pin it
again<00:04:11.350> underneath<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.400> way<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.580> can't

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
again underneath and that way you can't

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.310 
again underneath and that way you can't
tell<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.210> all<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:13.690> kind<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:13.960> a<00:04:14.140> cool

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
tell it all and it's kind of a cool

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.720 
tell it all and it's kind of a cool
effect<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.830> nobody<00:04:15.160> really<00:04:15.400> knows<00:04:15.520> how<00:04:15.670> you

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
effect and nobody really knows how you

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.190 
effect and nobody really knows how you
did<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.030> except<00:04:16.750> for<00:04:16.780> you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
did it except for you

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.660 
did it except for you
now<00:04:17.680> if<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:17.860> want<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.100> can<00:04:18.250> leave<00:04:18.340> your<00:04:18.459> bangs

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
now if you want you can leave your bangs

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.810 
now if you want you can leave your bangs
down<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.140> or<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.459> pin

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
down just like that or you can just pin

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.360 
down just like that or you can just pin
them<00:04:21.970> back<00:04:22.260> like<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:23.500> or<00:04:23.770> if<00:04:23.920> you<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.190> normal

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
them back like so or if you have normal

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.010 
them back like so or if you have normal
short<00:04:24.760> bangs<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.180> can<00:04:25.360> leave<00:04:25.510> them<00:04:25.660> down<00:04:25.690> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
short bangs you can leave them down and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.050 
short bangs you can leave them down and
I<00:04:26.080> think<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.380> would<00:04:26.530> be<00:04:26.620> adorable<00:04:26.910> but<00:04:27.910> that's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
I think it would be adorable but that's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:42.350
