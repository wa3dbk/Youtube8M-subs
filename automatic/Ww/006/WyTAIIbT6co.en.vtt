00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.600
 tee 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.340
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.920
 Hi everyone, it's a big four strength Yes Yes today is with videos in the hall 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.670
 In this case, elderly people 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.470
 I think I want to see the replay 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.820
 Yes, this is a replay of the person named right eye gate japan hero Hayashi 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.890
 Khan your opponent's hero 300020 and defend snow 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.410
 Counts, Cars and Kanst Kanst all the time and sweepers have nothing to do with it 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.720
 Let's look at it quickly 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.840
 Though I know it is the first Gorehogu this first giant was able in the city 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.760
 And golem 1238 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:53.410
 Ijiri chimes and this may be rich 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.940
 Goree of the one Wakan not become have you but are Well this is I in turn Hall of Gorehogu 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.989
 And this horse pattern is firmly in the ball breaker so I will cross here firmly 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.220
 To a 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.829
 We have also drilled a ball breaker not inserted here is also very thought 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.409
 And 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:12.350
 Eh-this time the range of the previous update tooth jump is greatly increased 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.640
 It always jumps wide 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.680
 Have I will feel and be back at once the center of it is a Golem and the Barbarian King 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.450
 I will 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:27.970
 It means that we will process enemy Barbarian king and costumes here and 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.610
 It is a form that it is not a hobetsu surgical fallback thing and usually turns a hob 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.610
 More and more, Inferno Tower 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:39.670
 That's right, you're right, that's right by doing so 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.080
 As the glider has no attack power 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.020
 Well in healing 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.460
 It is that it can recover, healing here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.030
 Has been disabled for a while, but it has been able to process sentences firmly 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.820
 Archer Queen from this perspective 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.500
 Physical strength max and this is very sweet and it's already healing here Ann 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.860
 Even in the fall 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.190
 Well if you don't even have the Inferno Tower, you can afford it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.600
 even here 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.600
 Inferno Tower Even if it is said that the remaining defense facility Kanst 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.010
 You can push it by number and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.110
 Archer Queen of Royal Cloak we are still climbing 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.850
 That means 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 It is to activate the clothing-facing rl Croaker I do not remain royal polo 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.780
 Archer has climbed to intact 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 I'm already great I'm trying to prevent the Archer Queen from attacking perfectly 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:42.190
 I will see that say that there is good at Tteyuu how to take the low relocation target because 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:46.660
 The point of this time is now the point of Gorehog itself, but after that the home itself 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.300
 Is to let golems and kings of kings take targets of the infrastructure tower 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.150
 First of all 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.510
 And to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.349
 It seems that the sweet spot is this time 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.819
 Well or in kind such drilling to say the position of such a place after jump 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:06.120
 Very high You think that the skill as a player is high 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.170
 a And that's right Gorehog's notes are still 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.690
 If there is not even Inferno Tower 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:18.050
 Only inches and hogliders are too amazing for me The tower is a threat today 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.880
 There is the fact that I'll take the target had been able to this time in the still Golem 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.260
 I think replay kana 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.030
 Now all means also towards the tomb minute blue sky all means towards everyone was Forges in that 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.030
 Thank you for watching
