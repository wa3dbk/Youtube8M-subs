00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
automatically makes a composition for it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760 
automatically makes a composition for it
which<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.950> adequate<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> its<00:00:39.290> render<00:00:40.290> settings

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
which is adequate to its render settings

you want to go you want to type wiggle

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
you want to go you want to type wiggle
bracket<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
bracket and then this is like the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.819 
bracket and then this is like the
dimensions<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> wiggle

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
dimensions of how it's going to wiggle

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.889 
dimensions of how it's going to wiggle
this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> basic<00:01:51.450> 15<00:01:52.220> comma<00:01:53.360> 30<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this is just the basic 15 comma 30 and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
this is just the basic 15 comma 30 and
then<00:01:55.110> close<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> brackets<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
then close the brackets you can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
then close the brackets you can
experiment<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> numbers<00:01:57.630> obviously

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
experiment with the numbers obviously

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.929 
experiment with the numbers obviously
the<00:01:58.619> higher<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> numbers<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.700> wiggle

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the higher the numbers the more wiggle

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.620 
the higher the numbers the more wiggle
you<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.710> you've<00:02:01.890> done<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
you get but so then you've done that and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.959 
you get but so then you've done that and
then<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.740> bar<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.759> these

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
then in the bar here there's these

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.359 
then in the bar here there's these
little<00:02:06.030> swirls<00:02:06.810> these<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.099> sway

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
little swirls these are little sway

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.609 
little swirls these are little sway
things<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> gonna<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.470> going

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
to get the swirly thing on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.360 
to get the swirly thing on
the<00:02:13.000> video<00:02:13.660> track<00:02:14.020> like<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.340> can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
squiggly thing on the null one and just

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
squiggly thing on the null one and just
do<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> same<00:02:25.930> foot<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.010> camera<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.490> just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
do the same foot on the camera so just

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.420 
do the same foot on the camera so just
get<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.120> drag<00:02:28.330> her<00:02:28.450> over<00:02:28.570> camera<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.830> that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
get it and drag her over camera and that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.190 
get it and drag her over camera and that
pairs<00:02:30.760> them<00:02:31.000> all<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.600> then<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:31.990> should

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
pairs them all up and then you should

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.820 
pairs them all up and then you should
get<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:33.460> wiggle<00:02:33.850> effect<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.680> can

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
get this wiggle effect and as you can

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.950 
get this wiggle effect and as you can
see<00:02:35.860> there's<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> black<00:02:36.790> black<00:02:37.420> borders

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
see there's the black black borders

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.200 
see there's the black black borders
which<00:02:38.290> look<00:02:38.560> really<00:02:38.830> bad<00:02:39.010> around<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:39.640> so

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
which look really bad around there so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.240 
which look really bad around there so
simply<00:02:40.930> how<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.140> fix<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.070> get

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
simply how you fix that you just get

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.780 
simply how you fix that you just get
your<00:02:42.340> video<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.230> let<00:02:44.230> me<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.560> zoom<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
your video and let me just zoom out a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.130 
your video and let me just zoom out a
bit<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.330> show<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.790> could<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.840> make

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
bit to show you you just could just make

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.570 
bit to show you you just could just make
it<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.410> little<00:02:50.800> bit<00:02:51.660> bigger<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.310> video

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
it a little bit bigger so like the video

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.520 
it a little bit bigger so like the video
is<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:55.420> bit<00:02:55.600> out<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.080> border

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
is just a little bit out of the border

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.650 
is just a little bit out of the border
so<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.550> see<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.820> Wiggles<00:02:58.240> but<00:02:58.450> there's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660
