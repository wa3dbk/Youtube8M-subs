00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 It's time galaxy is definitely mine 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.410
 favorite fight type 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.290
 and that's why I had to, of course 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 devote the same 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.840
 when i get the suggestion and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.750
 that's why this is now a video to the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 pokémon far too many in the name of all 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.699
 complain gala that is as I said 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 fighting dog also a psycho type what 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 first a pretty cool guy 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.660
 Second, where comes secondly develops 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.770
 from julia what i developed by prasler 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.440
 graßmann is also developing level 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.410
 20 listeners, however, can only one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 male curley was not what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.360
 looks similar with a look 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.289
 funkelstein in ghana is the transform 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.730
 it is not a feminine one 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.230
 galler clear the best works are on 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 every case attack and special 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 defense, however , one can with the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.969
 high special defense not so much 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.119
 to begin 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.140
 at gala of the kp and defense sooner 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 are moderate 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.960
 what do you do so you concentrate 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.640
 on the attack and the initiative the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 yes not bad but expandable 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.049
 Canada is usually considered super 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.460
 played and that you pack for it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.680
 I'll use that first 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 of course you need the psyche and the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.780
 kampfjets attack 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.299
 it is clearly a melee fight 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 not melee with a strength of 120 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.359
 and an accuracy 100 already something 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 to suspend it except that of course 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.409
 the defense saw the reason but went 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.569
 you can live with that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.770
 especially with the speed buggy is so 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.319
 does not endure so much 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 the psychos of the attack are two 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.399
 possibilities on the one hand you can the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.979
 Psycho sounds take the pure strength 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.469
 of 70 and some news 100 or 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.630
 the teeth head butt and gerhard one 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.299
 ceiling of 80 but only one accuracy 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.390
 from 90 still has the advantage us the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.060
 can make opponents recoil 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.010
 that is matter of taste in the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.349
 sixth generation generally popular 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.560
 tee fits well into this purely with 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.840
 especially the galaxy so one 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 effective counter counterpoker pokémon 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.260
 gets against that is not otherwise 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 could do a great deal 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.950
 tee has known the well 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.390
 Strength of 65 100 increases more 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.670
 but of course if the opponent 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.920
 or opposing pokémon 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.019
 item bears and that is here in 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.750
 completes almost every case 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.410
 in addition to sharing cameras in particular 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.120
 against flight pokemon is to recommend what 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.080
 but also for example ground 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.350
 pokémon can put 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.690
 also access to a great ta'qali 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
 namely on the shadow push with a 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.580
 strength of 40 and one of course 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.100
 accuracy of 100 and that's it 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.800
 on psycho pokémon contact one more 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.030
 possibility for coverage would be the lye 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.880
 blade strength 90 news 100 and me 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.800
 personally find plant attacks so 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.860
 the plants actually attack 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 attacking there I am always pretty 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.210
 good plant is a very defensive 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.620
 type and such attacks as foliage length 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.290
 Do things as short as packs 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.000
 process and finally, of course 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.390
 what a gala almost 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.420
 Duty is the sword dance to boost 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.850
 the attack because if it once 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.450
 or maybe even two times behind 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.060
 then has the opposing team 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.160
 no more land to see 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.660
 the evs for canada explain themselves there 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.570
 Of course, almost by itself 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.790
 attack by initiative hollow and first 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.580
 then comes the kp over a whole 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.290
 mean me passwesen one chooses then ever 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.300
 if you want to be faster or faster 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.640
 want to hit harder hard or glad 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.170
 as item complete whole defects in question 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.290
 live once 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.450
 that explains itself again 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.600
 increased just harm the gala clearly the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.810
 causes then but one more 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.080
 alternative experten.de Galladé access 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.670
 on many attacks has the pokémon 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.070
 meet effectively it is with security 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.480
 also not a bad choice or then there 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.600
 there is another god, that is 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.880
 focus color clear, yes, at least 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.670
 physically broken quickly 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.120
 goes and then of course there is the 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.150
 new galla the neat because in canada the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.090
 Ideas used and thus too mega 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.820
 galaxy develops then change 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.520
 its status values ​​as follows already 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.810
 high attack of 125 increases 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.570
 incredible 165 worth of defense 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.840
 rises to 95 that is not 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.640
 right on but he does it and 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.840
 the initiative worth the rest at ghana 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.480
 which was not so good 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.150
 it rises to 110 and thus can 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.960
 galla the very many things out 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.970
 offer as skill fits in very clearly 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.729
 how good honesty increases that 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.610
 attack in cagliari for one and light 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.849
 attack is hit lena gercke but 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.400
 By the way , it would not be enacted 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.300
 possibility rock solid that increases his 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.939
 initiative if it frightens who 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.069
 I can take it, too 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:43.430
 honesty is already essential 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.080
 more often what I might mention 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.629
 should be that there is a possibility 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.589
 yes clear as well as defensive play 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:54.580
 if you are not directly defensive but as 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:57.649
 also related to his special defense 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.069
 you can then use it to derive protzer 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:04.729
 and maybe even hypnosis thing 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:07.039
 and despite the defense he is not 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.559
 is as high as yes you may hear 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.110
 The attack has also increased again and 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.490
 that's pretty nice then can 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.749
 namely neat and clean 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.999
 neatly plug in 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:19.999
 place or best the remains and 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:23.240
 the essence says and the evs then 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.050
 Accordingly, I wanted only briefly 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.819
 cut 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.830
 so now how do i play the main galaxy 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.860
 i have my beloved gala the in 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.120
 opas awarded the mega stone and am 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.759
 So far , I'm pretty happy with it 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.430
 the results 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:44.779
 as a being it has per ability i have 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.089
 mentioned lazy are also as mentioned 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:50.300
 and then I play it with melee 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:52.550
 psycho blade foliage sound just because 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.459
 it's nice the whole swamp lizard so 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.820
 to clear out of the way and then 

00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:00.550
 swear to boost 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.050
 so that 's it for this one 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.620
 But years christmas me there after all 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.060
 So four days Happy fixed yet 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.060
 See you again until next time
