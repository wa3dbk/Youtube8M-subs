The four-legged heroes will be committed to face the return 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In the cast of voice actors, there many Hollywood stars: 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Alec Baldwin, Michael Clarke Duncan, Chris O'Donnell, and Roger Moore.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
After Body of Lies in 2008, Ridley Scott and Leonardo DiCaprio 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
could return to work on the same set for the film The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The film is taken from the memoir by Jordan Belfort

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
illustrating the story of the founder of a broker company in the late '80s and early '90s.

Of course, DiCaprio will play the leading role of Belfort and Ridley Scott will direct the movie.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The major MGM isnâ€™t going very well 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
because of serious financial troubles that seem to worsen daily.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Unfortunately, to suffer the consequences of this crisis was one of the most waited for films:

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the new James Bond.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The shooting was suspended until an undefined date.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Again, the role of the sexiest spy in history, would be played by Daniel Craig.&nbsp;
