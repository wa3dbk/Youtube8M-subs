00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:06.700
 we start with extracting the old hard 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.190
 drive from our old case 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.519
 computer to extract the old hard 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.660
 drive you need to remove both sides of the case 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.550
 there is left and right as removed 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.009
 sidewall we consider in the past 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.960
 video on i remind you need on the back 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.810
 Unscrew the housing cover, usually two 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.269
 screws on the top and bottom of the one on both sides 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.640
 in order to remove the hard drive itself 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.640
 you also need to turn two screws on each 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.780
 the sides on which it is attached ie 1 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.730
 2 3 4 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.950
 when we can cheat quietly 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.170
 unhindered pull yourself hard 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.390
 the disk that is it 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:58.870
 before this disconnecting the trains from not mind and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:01:01.090
 plume power from lion and devi order 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.190
 to connect our old hard drive 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.460
 we need to have on new 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.870
 motherboard and give the connector here it 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.160
 is at the bottom 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.820
 here it is blue usually on new maternal 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.340
 circuit boards 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.200
 he alone or he may not be at all 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.510
 so before you connect 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.970
 place the hard drive make sure that 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.170
 This connector is present on your 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.700
 new motherboard 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 now we will be directly 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.270
 connect the old hard drive itself for 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.130
 this we need a hard disk and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 loop idea and of course the port itself 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 we connect one end and gives a loop and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 tough 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.040
 Install the hard drive in the case and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.650
 connect to it now you can 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.310
 turn on the computer and start the download 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.710
 operating system now we have enabled 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.510
 we will start the computer in bios for 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.230
 In order to go into the bios you need to click 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.380
 a button that is David david 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.220
 booted up will kill us 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.170
 now weâ€™ll go into settings and see 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.050
 number of certain our hard 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.870
 drives so we see 1 skazi controller y 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.480
 us connected 2 this is our new hard 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.930
 drive sata it 3 hdd 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.430
 this is directly our old hard 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.880
 drive connected eating connector now 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.290
 you can reboot here is loading 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.220
 our operating system on the old 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.790
 hard disk there were two divisions on 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.790
 two disks 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.980
 in the new system is not the same two hard 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.980
 drives 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.549
 so now when loading we must 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.549
 4 local drives appear 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.100
 so go to share before see what 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.160
 software is being installed 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.160
