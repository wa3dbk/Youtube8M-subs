so we can just like this and click open

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.850 
so we can just like this and click open
for<00:04:31.600> me<00:04:31.720> it's<00:04:31.870> all<00:04:31.960> our<00:04:32.050> pad<00:04:32.350> so<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.710> won't

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
for me it's all our pad so it won't

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.480 
for me it's all our pad so it won't
catch<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.070> again

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
catch it again

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.450 
catch it again
and<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:35.110> recommend<00:04:35.440> making<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.890> back<00:04:36.040> up<00:04:36.250> this

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
and I recommend making it back up this

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.880 
and I recommend making it back up this
