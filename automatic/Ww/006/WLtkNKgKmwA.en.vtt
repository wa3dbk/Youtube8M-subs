00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it's in the past and we're going to let

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's in the past and we're going to let
it<00:01:40.470> lie<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.860> words<00:01:44.159> bus

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it lie you know so the the words bus

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.340 
it lie you know so the the words bus
comes<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.930> Latin<00:01:46.439> word<00:01:46.470> which<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:48.350> luxray

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
comes from a Latin word which is luxray

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.050 
comes from a Latin word which is luxray
and<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.390> ties<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> word

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and it also ties in with the word

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.230 
and it also ties in with the word
illustrates<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.130> way<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.790> us

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
illustrates and so this is a way for us

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.380 
illustrates and so this is a way for us
to<00:01:57.540> understand<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.469> cannot<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.670> our

last<00:02:00.810> strength<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.250> also<00:02:02.670> not

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
last strength if we are also not

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.069 
last strength if we are also not
illustrating<00:02:04.829> our<00:02:05.009> strength<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.719> from<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
balanced way in in a good way so those

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.930 
balanced way in in a good way so those
are<00:02:11.430> qualities<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.330> are

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
has a lot of Leo attributes to it and so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.140 
has a lot of Leo attributes to it and so
it's<00:02:32.680> really<00:02:32.860> important<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.670> utilize

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it's really important that we utilize

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.320 
it's really important that we utilize
our<00:02:34.510> creativity<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.740> by<00:02:36.280> doing<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.820> we<00:02:37.090> can

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
our creativity and by doing that we can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.160 
our creativity and by doing that we can
attain<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.500> beast<00:02:38.890> within<00:02:39.430> us<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.570> last<00:02:40.840> card

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.310 
attain the beast within us the last card
is<00:02:41.380> also<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> very<00:02:42.610> important<00:02:43.390> constellation

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
is also a very important constellation

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.980 
is also a very important constellation
for<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> high<00:02:45.220> priestess<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
for the high priestess because that the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.980 
for the high priestess because that the
numerical<00:02:47.530> values<00:02:48.010> are<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:49.210> same<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.960> the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
numerical values are the same so the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.330 
numerical values are the same so the
high<00:02:50.290> priestess<00:02:50.770> card<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.640> two<00:02:51.880> card<00:02:52.270> and

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
high priestess card is the two card and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.940 
high priestess card is the two card and
this<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.820> strength<00:02:55.270> left<00:02:55.450> card<00:02:55.960> is<00:02:56.170> an<00:02:56.350> 11

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
this the strength left card is an 11

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.290 
this the strength left card is an 11
value<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.450> number<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.290> Evan<00:02:59.800> is<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
value the number of Evan is it's a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
value the number of Evan is it's a
master<00:03:01.840> number<00:03:02.050> by<00:03:02.950> itself<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.210> that<00:03:04.450> that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
master number by itself and so that that

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.590 
master number by itself and so that that
quality<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.340> very<00:03:06.910> important<00:03:07.360> thing<00:03:07.570> to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
quality is a very important thing to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.520 
quality is a very important thing to
consider<00:03:08.170> also<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.210> 11<00:03:11.020> breaks<00:03:11.260> down

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
consider also that the 11 breaks down

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.420 
consider also that the 11 breaks down
one<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.070> one<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:12.970> two<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.590> use<00:03:15.070> the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
one and one to a two so we can use the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.870 
one and one to a two so we can use the
other<00:03:15.640> two<00:03:16.150> value<00:03:16.780> cards<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.220> throw<00:03:18.550> deck

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
other two value cards in the throw deck

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.680 
other two value cards in the throw deck
to<00:03:19.209> give<00:03:19.959> us<00:03:20.110> more<00:03:20.410> meaning<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.330> maybe<00:03:22.330> show<00:03:22.660> us

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
to give us more meaning to maybe show us

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.310 
to give us more meaning to maybe show us
what<00:03:23.320> sort<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:24.810> strengths<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.080> already

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
what sort of strengths that we already

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.460 
what sort of strengths that we already
have<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.280> even<00:03:27.820> challenges<00:03:28.810> help<00:03:29.050> us<00:03:29.200> to

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
have and even challenges help us to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.100 
have and even challenges help us to
identify<00:03:29.740> challenges<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:31.390> we<00:03:31.570> might<00:03:31.810> have

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
identify challenges that we might have

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.480 
identify challenges that we might have
that<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.590> don't<00:03:32.980> know<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.420> instance<00:03:35.490> the
