 Hello dear friends find yourself

 500 is my review on game training and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.210
 simulator 2 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 and today's review I review such 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.000
 card just on the trunk some 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 why we did not begin to survey us 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.250
 shift there why started choosing this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.180
 traffic there weather car the thing is that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 I have not chosen everything and this is my second entry 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 I will break it is not interrupted let's not 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.070
 I started to re- leave the menu for a long time 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.710
 don't boot in general then let's all with 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 what we do article 1 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510
 could not record first 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.770
 page on 1 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:57.360
 remember yes and here could not knows in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.420
 is it lacquer something else let's go 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.030
 what's the second time talking 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 I do not know why Korea was interrupted all that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 I have not registered the bandicam and can not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.570
 take a long time may because of what 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.840
 another just took off and record 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.840
 interrupted 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.470
 roll up the movie let's talk about 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.690
 map 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:44.990
 card see this very large bowl 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.979
 I have no long lag here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 so when very happy overall then 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:59.450
 body take my goat'll scratch quieter today 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.140
 more or less I think will be fine 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 heard by the way why I chose gazelles 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.380
 where I am more than once 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.239
 traveled to my reviews wanna say that 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.450
 the next review i will ride on 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.570
 dozens since finding out on 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 circuit and you really did not consider 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:27.830
 There is already a dozen in the next map 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:31.700
 papers on a newspaper ride very such 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.950
 comfortable and he doesn't throw from the side in 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 side cards six for example here 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 just lags me so they give us 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.790
 I personally recommend the distance I think it is and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:55.600
 advisable because instead like 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.600
 free so a traffic light 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.590
 so on 1 for the second when the mess 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.730
 It was, and therefore, that all had to be here. 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.730
 old reset 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.900
 mages you do not turn our bus on 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.879
 my side happened to us 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.569
 traffic accident well 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.569
 thank god more 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:40.230
 but now the boeing school so let's 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.069
 let's eat from strength here as there it is possible 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.200
 drive in 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:55.079
 this is now necessary to birth there is such 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:59.459
 function on the left 6 accelerated gas 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:02.819
 that is, gas modes we have it very 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.019
 cool really me this is very 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.810
 like the industry 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.439
 artificial can be accelerated just 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.569
 pressed the left shift and that's how they 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.750
 infinite 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.729
 without interruption accelerated gamma 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:27.510
 us accelerated mode gases I already 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:33.500
 catching up the car there are four a long time I will go 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.500
 Amga is not faster than these bots 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.639
 well quieter water 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:49.689
 I have overtaken this is probably too early 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:53.229
 let us return a little train yes I 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:58.409
 I thought I would finish my review and 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:02.860
 I don't want to fly the second time 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:05.919
 The weather, I chose well for me this 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.310
 lipstick really like and there is no sun and 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.289
 kind of like and not such a blue slush 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.289
 his book begins 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:23.219
 man stupid need to go quickly need 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:33.060
 I illuminate the maximum speed at 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:33.060
 gazelki 90 kilometers per hour that 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:50.040
 so the whole city on the third 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.040
 a traffic light here we blow right there 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:02.310
 tough clear on page 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.310
 so what 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.610
 behind you go ahead advance 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:18.169
 damn wanted to make for 5 Dniester 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.169
 always don't understand why this is happening 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:30.729
 3 call credible 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.729
 and although they have parking 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:40.489
 so engagement works 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:51.069
 for you are a ram or something I'm a little bit 

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:53.529
 no so tart parked parking lots 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:58.489
 father parking on 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:01.539
 but I will not repark what I want 

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:05.089

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.579

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:11.989
 gazelku because 

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:18.069
 to go here on a big note 

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:21.429
 the car was a review 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:24.949
 you can see how it will turn the steering wheel in the cab 

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:28.639
 in the salon hands do not show sad 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:31.789
