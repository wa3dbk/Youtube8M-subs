00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
especially with LED lights making the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.770 
especially with LED lights making the
DIY<00:03:29.739> lights<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.639> could<00:03:30.879> be<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> little<00:03:31.359> bit<00:03:31.540> more

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
DIY lights it could be a little bit more

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530 
DIY lights it could be a little bit more
hidden<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.409> it<00:03:33.250> gives<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.549> little<00:03:33.760> bit<00:03:33.879> more

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
hidden and it gives a little bit more

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.110 
hidden and it gives a little bit more
tallness<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> tank<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.129> as<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:36.940> can<00:03:37.090> see

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
tallness to the tank and as you can see

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.020 
tallness to the tank and as you can see
the<00:03:37.599> tank<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:38.019> pretty<00:03:38.379> tall<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.829> has<00:03:39.069> 40<00:03:39.579> inches

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the tank is pretty tall it has 40 inches

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.020 
the tank is pretty tall it has 40 inches
of<00:03:40.299> tank<00:03:41.199> height<00:03:41.440> sorry<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.519> stand<00:03:42.819> Heights

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
of tank height sorry the stand Heights

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.960 
of tank height sorry the stand Heights
40<00:03:43.479> inches<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.169> then<00:03:44.500> another<00:03:44.680> 24<00:03:45.340> inches<00:03:45.699> for

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
40 inches and then another 24 inches for

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.229 
40 inches and then another 24 inches for
the<00:03:46.000> tank<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:47.769> probably<00:03:48.129> about<00:03:48.310> five<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.180> a

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the tank it's probably about five and a

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.080 
the tank it's probably about five and a
half<00:03:49.299> feet<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.930> this<00:03:50.530> here<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.430> then<00:03:51.459> maybe

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
half feet to this here and then maybe

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.319 
half feet to this here and then maybe
another<00:03:52.239> six<00:03:52.569> to<00:03:52.959> eight<00:03:53.199> inches<00:03:53.229> on<00:03:54.659> the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
another six to eight inches on the

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.719 
another six to eight inches on the
canopy<00:03:58.329> so<00:03:59.260> it'd<00:03:59.680> probably<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.189> just<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.699> little

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
canopy so it'd probably be just a little

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.409 
canopy so it'd probably be just a little
bit<00:04:01.000> taller<00:04:01.090> than<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.689> am<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:02.650> we'll<00:04:03.489> see<00:04:03.729> how<00:04:03.939> it

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
bit taller than I am so we'll see how it

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.869
