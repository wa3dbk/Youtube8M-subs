00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
here's the graphic

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.330 
here's the graphic
Tony<00:00:27.539> Hawk<00:00:27.750> birdhouse<00:00:28.170> probably<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
Tony Hawk birdhouse probably like one of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
Tony Hawk birdhouse probably like one of
the<00:00:29.429> coolest<00:00:29.640> graphics<00:00:30.090> um<00:00:32.540> yeah<00:00:33.540> okay<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the coolest graphics um yeah okay so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.910 
the coolest graphics um yeah okay so
clear<00:00:34.680> let<00:00:35.040> me<00:00:35.130> talk<00:00:35.340> about<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.640> board<00:00:36.620> on<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
clear let me talk about the board on the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
clear let me talk about the board on the
size<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.489> 7.5<00:00:39.739> standard<00:00:40.739> size<00:00:41.120> um<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.690> shaping

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
size is 7.5 standard size um the shaping

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
size is 7.5 standard size um the shaping
was<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.059> when<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> first

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
was good at first like when you first

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.930 
was good at first like when you first
get<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.579> start<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
get it but then when you start take a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
get it but then when you start take a
look<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> weird-looking

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
look at it it's kind of weird-looking

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.639 
look at it it's kind of weird-looking
they<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.399> modded<00:00:51.379> concave<00:00:52.379> mark

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
they do this little modded concave mark

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
they do this little modded concave mark
so<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.520> turn<00:00:53.760> scars<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
so you don't get turn scars but you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
so you don't get turn scars but you
still<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.750> um<00:00:57.859> it's<00:00:58.859> pretty<00:00:59.039> nice<00:00:59.219> board<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
still do um it's pretty nice board the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
still do um it's pretty nice board the
grip<00:00:59.879> tape<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
grip tape is I don't know what kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
grip tape is I don't know what kind of
grip<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> people<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> birdhouse

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
cool um so um the hardware is birdhouse

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.749 
cool um so um the hardware is birdhouse
it's<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> allen<00:01:21.540> key<00:01:21.720> ones<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:23.340> don't<00:01:23.580> like

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

it's the allen key ones I don't like
that<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.030> key<00:01:24.210> ones<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> Phillips

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that one key ones I like the Phillips

that one key ones I like the Phillips
I'd<00:01:25.470> better<00:01:25.970> not<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> side<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.840> side<00:01:28.280> has

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
I'd better not the side this side has

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.700 
I'd better not the side this side has
birdhouse<00:01:30.570> printed<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.560> kind

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
birdhouse printed right there it's kind

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.249 
birdhouse printed right there it's kind
of<00:01:31.770> scratched<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.280> though<00:01:32.720> um<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.409> wheels<00:01:34.790> are

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
of scratched up though um the wheels are

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.450 
of scratched up though um the wheels are
birdhouse<00:01:37.259> wheels<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
birdhouse wheels as you can see in the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.359 
birdhouse wheels as you can see in the
bottom<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.820> turned<00:01:39.150> them<00:01:39.240> inside<00:01:39.390> out<00:01:40.369> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
bottom I just turned them inside out so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.389 
bottom I just turned them inside out so
they<00:01:41.640> match<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> board<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.829> bearings<00:01:44.220> on

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
they match the board so the bearings on

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.060 
they match the board so the bearings on
this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> birdhouse<00:01:44.909> um<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> people

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this is birdhouse um so a lot of people

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.760 
this is birdhouse um so a lot of people
say<00:01:47.220> birdhouse<00:01:47.640> skateboards<00:01:48.149> suck<00:01:48.450> um<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
say birdhouse skateboards suck um I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.510

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
favorite board like birdhouse is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.770 
favorite board like birdhouse is
probably<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.159> favorite<00:01:56.490> brands<00:01:56.780> but

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
probably one of my favorite brands but

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.959 
probably one of my favorite brands but
it's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.320> favorite<00:01:58.680> board<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's not my favorite board but I like it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.609 
it's not my favorite board but I like it
it's<00:02:00.360> nice<00:02:01.430> um<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.149> kana<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> heavy<00:02:03.810> side<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's nice um the kana on a heavy side I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.580 
it's nice um the kana on a heavy side I
think<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> trucks<00:02:06.899> or<00:02:07.110> something<00:02:07.140> but

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
think is are the trucks or something but

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
think is are the trucks or something but
if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.340> apart<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.849> took<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.179> apart

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
if you take this apart I took it apart

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
if you take this apart I took it apart
like<00:02:09.629> once<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> board<00:02:11.069> was<00:02:11.190> pretty

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
like once you know the board was pretty

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.060 
like once you know the board was pretty
light<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.450> pretty<00:02:12.780> lightweight

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
light so it's pretty lightweight

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.110 
light so it's pretty lightweight
it<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.490> gets<00:02:14.580> heavy<00:02:14.850> because<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> trucks

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
it just gets heavy because of the trucks

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.560 
it just gets heavy because of the trucks
um<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:20.160> bad<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.120> hate<00:02:21.540> that
