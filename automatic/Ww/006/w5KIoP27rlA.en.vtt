we're<00:03:49.549> working<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.090> something<00:03:50.390> big<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:51.019> we

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
we're working on something big that we

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.860 
we're working on something big that we
can't<00:03:51.650> talk<00:03:51.860> about<00:03:52.070> yet<00:03:52.220> it'll<00:03:53.060> look<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.480> lot

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
can't talk about yet it'll look a lot

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.800 
can't talk about yet it'll look a lot
better<00:03:54.200> than<00:03:54.860> NBA<00:03:55.040> 2k15<00:03:55.790> which<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.540> amazing

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
better than NBA 2k15 which is amazing

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.569 
better than NBA 2k15 which is amazing
because<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.769> honest<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.220> thought<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
because to be honest I thought the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.330 
because to be honest I thought the
animations<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.299> 2k15<00:03:59.810> were<00:04:00.230> pretty<00:04:00.650> good<00:04:00.920> they

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
animations in 2k15 were pretty good they

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250 
animations in 2k15 were pretty good they
were<00:04:01.400> better<00:04:01.700> than<00:04:01.820> 2k14<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.870> they<00:04:02.959> still

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
were better than 2k14 but they still

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.229 
were better than 2k14 but they still
weren't<00:04:03.440> phenomenal<00:04:04.100> but<00:04:04.519> he's<00:04:04.700> talking<00:04:05.090> like

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
weren't phenomenal but he's talking like

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.940 
weren't phenomenal but he's talking like
they're<00:04:05.450> gonna<00:04:05.570> be<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> lot<00:04:06.290> better<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
they're gonna be a lot better and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.400 
they're gonna be a lot better and
hopefully<00:04:07.430> this<00:04:07.790> will<00:04:07.940> be<00:04:08.000> more<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:09.260> know

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
hopefully this will be more you know

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.590 
hopefully this will be more you know
stuff<00:04:09.799> based<00:04:10.250> on<00:04:10.459> signature<00:04:11.090> guys<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.540> just

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
stuff based on signature guys and just

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.930 
stuff based on signature guys and just
smoother<00:04:12.140> animations<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:13.370> know<00:04:13.519> in<00:04:13.700> general

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
smoother animations you know in general

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.849 
smoother animations you know in general
just<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:14.840> get<00:04:14.959> an<00:04:15.079> overall<00:04:15.470> more

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
just so we can get an overall more

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.159 
just so we can get an overall more
realistic<00:04:16.519> looking<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.120> feeling<00:04:17.359> basketball

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
realistic looking and feeling basketball

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.039 
realistic looking and feeling basketball
game<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.620> I'm<00:04:18.680> feeling

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
game and I'm feeling

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.110 
game and I'm feeling
pretty<00:04:19.199> optimistic<00:04:19.409> about<00:04:20.009> that<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.579> that's

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
pretty optimistic about that so that's

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.969 
pretty optimistic about that so that's
really<00:04:21.359> all<00:04:21.659> we<00:04:21.690> got<00:04:22.019> they<00:04:22.199> also<00:04:22.409> gave<00:04:22.770> out<00:04:22.949> a

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
really all we got they also gave out a

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.740 
really all we got they also gave out a
locker<00:04:23.310> code<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.819> locker<00:04:24.060> code<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.389> also

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
locker code that locker code I also

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.809 
locker code that locker code I also
tweeted<00:04:25.259> out<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.680> believe<00:04:26.220> that's<00:04:26.460> either<00:04:26.699> a

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
tweeted out I believe that's either a

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.860 
tweeted out I believe that's either a
random<00:04:27.360> item<00:04:27.659> code<00:04:27.930> or<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.639> 1600<00:04:29.639> BC<00:04:29.819> code<00:04:30.330> so

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
random item code or a 1600 BC code so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.330 
random item code or a 1600 BC code so
you<00:04:30.960> guys<00:04:31.169> can<00:04:31.379> see<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:32.039> on<00:04:32.129> the<00:04:32.220> screen
