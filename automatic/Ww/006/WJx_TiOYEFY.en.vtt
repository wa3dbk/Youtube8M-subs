 hello and welcome to 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.020
 our channel league leo and in this 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.000
 video is about the command is 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
 this command is a very 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.600
 useful command and what is the 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.190
 Not really for a long time 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.420
 have taught and always such a 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.790
 have missed a bit 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.590
 so you do not have that for you so long 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.910
 I'll show you in this one 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:44.680
 video how to give your dog something 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:46.060
 can teach seated stand came as one 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 I already have a look here 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.550
 chosen primitive approach I have 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.190
 just manually with the hand 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.530
 dog caused himself to ask 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.510
 I just have the cleo completely 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.180
 careful here with the hand on the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.770
 side up pushed in the moment 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.239
 where she did it and herself 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.619
 Of course, I have stated 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.619
 clicked and rewarded 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.270
 Leo is synonymous if it looks like this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.700
 as if I had the cleo within the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 minutes taught that is not the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.260
 Reality that took a few days 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 and that really paid off 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.880
 consistently to stay on the ball because 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.479
 initially the progress was relative 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.479
 moderate 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.960
 stands still 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.890
 which one sees well this gesture 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.570
 which push up by the manual 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.060
 which is still very much 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 important for us and can only be with the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:14.820
 Time so piece by piece back 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:14.820
 will be back 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:35.590
 back back back seat back to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.900
 Backseat I hope the video has you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.069
 I liked you too 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.870
 I would be there for a while 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.700
 file because I just want one more 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.680
 get much better distance 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 but overall I am quite 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 satisfied that the now ever 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.530
 has subscribed main channel that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.940
 I would be very happy and see you 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.940
