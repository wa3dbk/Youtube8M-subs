00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 USA 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 hi guys all swamis hobby today 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.660
 I would like to finally tell you about 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.639
 assault rifles 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.900
 or rather talk today about the famous 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.850
 rifle soon 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.369
 this rifle was present in it inside 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.230
 but was in the class of carbines and you 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.300
 probably such a question why now 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.369
 she suddenly became an assault rifle 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.680
 The answer is simple let me most likely decided 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.509
 pay tribute to realism and recognized soon 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.579
 a full assault rifle 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.010
 precisely because of its damage which even in 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.960
 This filter was like well, if you assault 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.060
 see real data rather that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.649
 this is really an assault rifle they 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.600
 carbine just unlike its 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.730
 older brother with punishment she is different 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.949
 smaller caliber and she more 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.019
 compact and designed for 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.329
 premises and for the assault of small 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.250
 objects but rather more severe 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.710
 the rifle is intended generally for 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.839
 conducting combat operations in the open 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.969
 Well I would like to apologize for 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.070
 trailer video second assault trailers 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.780
 since did not attach much importance here 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.089
 this moment which you see on 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.830
 its screens here are depicted rather 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.350
 at that moment it seemed to me for some reason 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.200
 what is scar-h but then comparing them became 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.540
 it can be seen that it is larger in size which means 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 We are waiting for the return of his elder brother well, 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 now more but rather immediately say 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.380
 all statistics damage 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.120
 maximum 34 applied at a distance 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.370
 up to eight meters minimum damage 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.190
 make 25 applied at a distance 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.170
 55 min tactical recharge takes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.210
 one full nine tenths of a second 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.680
 full reload you take two wholes 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.710
 four tenths of a second 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.500
 recoil horizontally and to the left 0.2 in 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.420
 right too 0.2 and vertically recoil 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.700
 is zero point fifty well 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.530
 Generally how can the whole narrowest 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.050
 great damage in the class of assault rifles 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.480
 plus if you add up what u say very 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.640
 small scatter and quick-fire 620 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.500
 shots per minute can also peek 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.510
 on return horizontal us 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.970
 can be compensated for ats vertical 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.520
 do so in the general set 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.920
 an inclined knob or handle and truncated 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.080
 Also on the Duma constantly muzzle 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 Here are these upgrades to help us cope 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.410
 with vertical recoil 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.760
 and it makes more likely of course 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.920
 effectively on long and medium 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.320
 distances in the near he of course 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
 loses by rate of fire but not 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.550
 everything should be so good one more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 minus karych is his shop he 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.960
 makes only 20 rounds 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.240
 but judge for yourself the most highly homely 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.430
 the barrel and also for sure yes there is a big 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.709
 what slave would it be ? 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.890
 barrel due to the fact that Obama is less yes 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.510
 eat this way it is balanced 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.910
 portraying I already said that the sloping 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.040
 handle or short handle on 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.530
 trunk 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 hang the muzzle but ltsu can 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.769
 lead or angry more abruptly and butt + 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 torch 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.909
 so that the hips will shoot us 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.069
 take it easy up from the first on the advice all 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.290
 neighbor it was graphic or 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.299
 work without sight well and cool 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.790
 The upgrade that comes to build is 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.900
 put the beveled fly and 4 times 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.569
 acog sight 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.609
 and it will be just perfect especially 4 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.739
 multiple sight will help you on large and 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.810
 medium distances and beveled front sight 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.090
 will help you in confined spaces 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.310
 and forget to say what to open 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.430
 you rather need 4000 points 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.319
 attack aircraft and this is a beautiful barrel your well 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.090
 and on this friends probably all 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.829
 and now subscribe to the channel set 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.139
 likes to leave your comments and also 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.250
 look at my twitter look at 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.919
 VKontakte group 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.450
