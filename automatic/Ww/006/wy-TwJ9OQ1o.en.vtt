00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and what that does is and what that does

and what that does is and what that does
is<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.300> screen<00:02:29.540> you're<00:02:29.810> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.990> see<00:02:30.280> two

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
is on the screen you're going to see two

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.590 
is on the screen you're going to see two
inputs<00:02:31.810> frame<00:02:32.810> apart<00:02:33.110> for<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> medium<00:02:33.980> punch

inputs frame apart for the medium punch

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.890 
inputs frame apart for the medium punch
and<00:02:35.600> what<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.840> will<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:36.170> like<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:40.900> don't

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and what that will look like is I don't

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.940 
and what that will look like is I don't
have<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.050> stick<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.350> front<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> front<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.860> me

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
have my stick in front of front of me

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.370 
have my stick in front of front of me
but<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.280> get<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.459> idea<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:44.570> pretty<00:02:45.320> much

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
but you get the idea and pretty much

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.410 
but you get the idea and pretty much
what<00:02:45.620> that's<00:02:45.770> used<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.550> one<00:02:47.150> frame

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
what that's used for is like one frame

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
what that's used for is like one frame
links<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.260> things<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.770> really<00:02:48.800> need<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
links for things that you really need to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
links for things that you really need to
get<00:02:49.489> out<00:02:49.700> as<00:02:49.970> soon<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.390> possible<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.320> can't

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
get out as soon as possible you can't

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.830 
get out as soon as possible you can't
screw<00:02:51.860> up<00:02:51.950> by<00:02:52.100> one<00:02:52.700> frame<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.420> screw<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.720> by

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
screw up by one frame so you screw up by

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.090 
screw up by one frame so you screw up by
one<00:02:54.050> frame<00:02:54.380> you're<00:02:54.650> done<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.950> is

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
one frame you're done but this is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.020 
one frame you're done but this is
something<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.430> saw<00:02:58.730> and<00:03:00.700> double<00:03:01.700> tapping<00:03:01.850> is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
something I saw and double tapping is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.729 
something I saw and double tapping is
weird<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.510> can't<00:03:02.900> seem<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.200> get<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.350> good<00:03:03.560> grasp

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
weird I can't seem to get a good grasp

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.850 
weird I can't seem to get a good grasp
on<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.640> for<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.420> kicks<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.050> fine<00:03:06.380> before<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
on it for the kicks it's fine before the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.350 
on it for the kicks it's fine before the
medium<00:03:07.130> plunges<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.580> don't<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.820> enough<00:03:08.030> space

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
medium plunges I don't have enough space

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.560 
medium plunges I don't have enough space
to<00:03:08.420> really<00:03:08.810> do<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> way<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> want<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.570> Justin

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
to really do it the way I want to Justin

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.410 
to really do it the way I want to Justin
was<00:03:11.810> doing<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.080> very<00:03:12.260> slowly<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.280> maybe<00:03:13.820> that's

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
was doing it very slowly so maybe that's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.479 
was doing it very slowly so maybe that's
the<00:03:14.600> trick<00:03:14.870> maybe<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:16.010> doesn't<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.430> be

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the trick maybe it doesn't have to be

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.320 
the trick maybe it doesn't have to be
really<00:03:16.850> fast<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:19.340> I'm<00:03:19.970> going<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> practice

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
really fast so I'm going to practice

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.960 
really fast so I'm going to practice
work<00:03:20.600> with<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.930> hit<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.290> lab<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.040> see<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:22.910> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
work with that hit the lab and see if I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.900 
work with that hit the lab and see if I
could<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.360> down<00:03:23.570> because<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.730> is

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
could get that down because this is

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.539 
could get that down because this is
important<00:03:26.269> for<00:03:26.360> Rose<00:03:26.540> fighters<00:03:26.840> out<00:03:26.989> there

even<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.400> with<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.760> can<00:03:46.910> do<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
even and with that you can do a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.380 
even and with that you can do a
crouching<00:03:47.420> medium<00:03:48.110> punch<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> count

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390

counter<00:03:50.810> hit<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.380> keep<00:03:51.680> pressure<00:03:52.040> going

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
counter hit you can keep pressure going

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.380 
counter hit you can keep pressure going
so<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.360> would<00:03:53.540> drill<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:54.829> crouching<00:03:55.820> strong

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
so you would drill a crouching strong

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.319 
so you would drill a crouching strong
drill<00:03:57.170> again<00:03:57.730> kind<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.970> Bison

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
drill again kind of like the Bison
