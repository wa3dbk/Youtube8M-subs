Darryl I think they do make this tool

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.970 
Darryl I think they do make this tool

aluminum so I don't have a way to the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.479 
aluminum so I don't have a way to the
world<00:00:45.090> aluminum<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> went<00:00:46.829> down<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> hardware

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
world aluminum so I went down a hardware

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.690 
world aluminum so I went down a hardware
store<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> left<00:00:48.870> hand<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.700> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
store get a left hand that this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360 
store get a left hand that this
turnbuckle<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.480> right<00:00:51.780> hand<00:00:52.079> thread<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.860> left

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
turnbuckle I right hand thread and left

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.979 
turnbuckle I right hand thread and left
hand<00:00:53.550> thread<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.170> one<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.500> things<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
hand thread and one of these things is a

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
hand thread and one of these things is a
to<00:00:57.989> replace<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> weld<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> nut

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to replace this just going to weld a nut

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.950 
to replace this just going to weld a nut
onto<00:00:59.969> onto<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.340> way<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.699> turn<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.780 

okay<00:01:10.680> i<00:01:10.710> use<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:12.200> bowl<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:14.070> squeeze<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> two

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
okay i use a bowl to squeeze the two

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:24.080 
okay i use a bowl to squeeze the two
nuts<00:01:15.030> together<00:01:15.530> before<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> well<00:01:22.550> okay<00:01:23.550> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
nuts together before I well okay so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.320 
nuts together before I well okay so
basically<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:27.119> not

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
basically this one I look like it's not

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.520 
basically this one I look like it's not
pretty<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.170> works<00:01:28.409> pretty<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:30.119> can

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
pretty but it works pretty good you can

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
pretty but it works pretty good you can
you<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.399> push<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> frame

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you want if you need to push the frame

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
you want if you need to push the frame
out<00:01:33.149> you<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.869> crank<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> if

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
out you just crank it down like that if

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
out you just crank it down like that if
you<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.210> draw<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.050> just<00:01:37.259> crank<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you need to draw it in you just crank it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.600 
you need to draw it in you just crank it
up<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.409> did<00:01:40.409> make<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.460> bit

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
up like that I did make it a little bit

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.680 
up like that I did make it a little bit
big<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.200> other<00:01:44.390> side<00:01:45.390> car

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
big I don't know what other side car

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.490 
big I don't know what other side car
dimension<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.110> bigger<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
dimension is just a little bit bigger so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
dimension is just a little bit bigger so
I<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.800> put<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> piece<00:01:50.160> of<00:01:50.190> rubber<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I can put a piece of rubber in there so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.460 
I can put a piece of rubber in there so
you<00:01:52.289> will<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:52.740> scratch<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> paint<00:01:54.320> same<00:01:55.320> as

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you will not scratch the paint same as

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.850 
you will not scratch the paint same as
that<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> basically<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.050> left<00:01:58.619> hand

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
that so basically you get left hand

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
that so basically you get left hand
thread<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.580> hand<00:01:59.850> thread<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.570> draw

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
thread right hand thread you draw

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.090 
thread right hand thread you draw
together<00:02:01.080> as<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.500> push<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:03.539> can

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
together as you push it out and you can

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.320 
together as you push it out and you can
adjust<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.580> frame<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:06.090> an<00:02:06.300> out<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:08.119> know<00:02:09.119> in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
adjust the frame in an out you know in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.530 
adjust the frame in an out you know in
very<00:02:09.929> small<00:02:10.019> increment<00:02:10.890> without<00:02:11.880> being<00:02:12.390> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
very small increment without being it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.280 
very small increment without being it
beat<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.230> beat<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.730> frame<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.209> hammer<00:02:15.739> in

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
beat it beat the frame with a hammer in

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
beat it beat the frame with a hammer in
damage<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> stuff<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:22.340> basically<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
damage and stuff so basically that's the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.000 
damage and stuff so basically that's the
idea<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.829> pretty<00:02:26.040> easy<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:27.360> install

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
idea and it's pretty easy to to install

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.949 
idea and it's pretty easy to to install
it's<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.190> hard<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.549> basically<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.660> is

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
it's not very hard so basically this is

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.870 
it's not very hard so basically this is
what<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.320> look<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:36.829> it's<00:02:37.829> pretty<00:02:38.130> simple<00:02:38.400> as

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
what I look like it's pretty simple as

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.770 
what I look like it's pretty simple as
you<00:02:39.090> both<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:40.980> duval<00:02:41.459> left<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.630> right

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
you both to in duval left and right

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.910 
you both to in duval left and right
