00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.839
 had decided 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.939
 I did not have any legs biscuits baked Obama last year 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.780
 I have this year 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.230
 a 2 1-victory in the oven flood prepared the business was the reason 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.580
 that's what i mean last year 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.180
 and that you know that he does not have much to laugh about 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.079
 because I like to bake cookies with ISPA 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.459
 because I partly go with them and after all, they are with me 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.119
 as a small wheel BC Kieksen gives the first person this number 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.560
 on which has 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.430
 so i love it's just a couple of parents took too 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.100
 take 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.320
 and to bake an ethic 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 To show perspectives that even with little money you can see it in the infobox 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940
 and who's on 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 I hope it will be so it's percent we have 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.780
 but that's what these are part of the game agreed 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.499
 the last few days neighbors 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.400
 WS 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.430
 backwards so let's say wayport or classic pop or to be able to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 No no 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.910
 why many 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.870
 click here 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.010
 with spam 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.530
 choose 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.210
 percent 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 if they want to keep informing their readers they are also called 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.490
 it will be completely unacceptable 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 Even at the wheel over there, not driving Sep, whatever Robben said 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.040
 the ZFC that it is not that it will come that way 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 so you get later 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.159
 In it he tells it he was applying Euro yields here 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.650
 you can not say Berlin 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.869
 Wissmann beside the bottom I counted the end went 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.420
 I like very Euro 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.809
 if in the next few years are getting off 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.919
 4 2 percent has been achieved 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:13.820
 universities 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.739
 the tours 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.139
 RP 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.139
 Minden MT 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.619
 a point victory 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.949
 under the name suffix 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.579
 of course he did not want to be brought as an advantage 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.679
 the victory in the end the lawyers and conveniently by e-mail 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.809
 SFR 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.809
 The region was safe for five years 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.649
 Werther replace in class 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.149
 that sounds right 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.759
 it does not exist in evil 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.999
 but not in the rules like that 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.779
 the juvenile one is reduced to one 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.109
 nowhere this evening 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.489
 who think in their own thinking many and b 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.999
 some trees like 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.000
 percent 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.779
 4 9 percent 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 you do not do that at all 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.219
 from the person 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.219
 and an end to recognize that 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.759
 an end 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.649
 after all our deposits and skepticism 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.399
 Consumers should go in writing way but we have 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.489
 Munich ddp 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.149
 they would have to end 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.129
 45 to 60 minutes 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.460
 Euro continued 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.460
 for restlessness 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.009
 21 percent 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.009
 now she wants to soothe her 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 similar to the BGL 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 Robespierre 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.039
 available 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.349
 you never know 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.099
 Munich a Verte FBI with 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.159
 really dangerous animals were fed up 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.199
 because customers 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.199
 Do not think clearly about the markets 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.710
 Becker 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 he can 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.740
 while the remaining shares 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.259
 that's you 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.909
 of 30 percent 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.330
 compared with 1 2 3 4 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.949
 5 6 7 8 percent to 45 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.249
 It should have seen its 30 o'clock the movie 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.909
 we talked 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.719
 Berlin 4 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.460
 Martin Wiesmann for the 22nd 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.460
 who have not been so far 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.449
 Lyon 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.509
 these values ​​are not stored and Jürgen Ruf enjoys 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.460
 a too the idea and 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.349
 and I give the interest and 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.340
 only then can they meet the match by 0 4 percent
