00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Momo in love friends and very warmly 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.250
 welcome to a very special pc 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.460
 buy recommendation today for you and indeed 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.290
 Yesterday the gtx 67 came out and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 I just thought to myself 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.980
 just throw the graphics card in 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.439
 the pc and tries the whole so cheap 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.930
 as possible and then keep you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.650
 Of course, highly recommend 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.939
 to be able to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 I have that too now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.570
 and do not be angry with me but me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.500
 have now here again amd 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 cpu in it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.070
 I know many of you may say 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.719
 the intel must have three if one 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 Assemble a game pc 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.670
 I think that's a bit different 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.780
 they do not do such a bad job 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 in most games you will be the one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.370
 difference barely notice and with six 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.489
 You can definitely do better without cores 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.820
 I'm working with a 3 now 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.610
 would have to go in here for 100 euros 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.510
 that's why I have you the amd fx 6300 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 not put in the new fx 6350 because 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 the 30 euros more expensive would therefore be the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.479
 older ones here and with that you should too 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.869
 can play well and every game on 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.250
 gamble on maximum settings 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.110
 at least with the processor with the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.310
 graphics card now maybe not every 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.939
 but almost every so to the mainboard that it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 dry 970 pro3 actually has everything 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.479
 what you need so that you can 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.210
 really be happy for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 ddr3 ram banks usb3 sata 3 with 6 mbit 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 if I'm here right now they 6 gb 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 10 is already said that means 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 The hard disk will also be nice and fast 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.189
 run and for 67 euros you can 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.020
 not really much complain 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.979
 and the processor is also great 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.100
 on it on the whole so as a graphics card 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.430
 I thought about what gtx 67 you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.509
 for your installation and the pellet gtx 760 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.689
 jetstream with 2 gb gddr5 memory was 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.909
 just the cheapest and overclocked and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.520
 So factory overclocked graphics cards 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.050
 that's why the mindfactory has to offer 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.489
 I have you right now and now too 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.780
 not a bad cooler that go 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.230
 Of course not because of that I have myself 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.790
 the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 just taken out here 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.019
 to show her on the picture again 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 it would look like the first one 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.129
 times that pellet here so many 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.940
 red elements in which cooler has blocked 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.879
 I think that's not bad at all 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.920
 looks pretty chic and she will 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.310
 of course also games like battlefield 3 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.049
 at 60 fps approximately at maximum 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.849
 to make settings work 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.280
 and things like metro last light 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.540
 or crysis 3 are also very fluid 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.849
 run on high details 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.620
 that's the cool of a graphics card and 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.900
 that for the price and she will too 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.160
 a little bit in price I take 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.569
 Now, that's just yesterday 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.269
 come out and now it is already 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.890
 that's why I can give you the 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.319
 really highly recommend 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.599
 as a hard drive have me in here 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.410
 a 1000 gigabyte seagate barracuda with 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.930
 7200 rpm for 51 euro I find it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.640
 is not worth 500 gb hard drive too 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.650
 because the cost now 40 euros or 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.019
 I pay ten euros more on it 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.120
 double the amount of memory doing so 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.609
 you are cheap in this too 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.829
 kept calculator clean and no 500 gb 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.750
 hard disk because I find these ten 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.299
 euro are very very well invested and 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 should then somehow pure 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.410
 can get 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.739
 yes, as a memory I'm careful 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.120
 gigabyte ram value ddr3 1333 cl9 toolkit 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.530
 eight gigabytes because of the reason 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.150
 I would have taken a lot of gigabytes now 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.269
 which would have been enough in theory 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.980
 I would be around 525 sowas around the rotation 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.530
 landed and that is not smooth now 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.299
 number because of 550 smooth and I have 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.669
 thought that is a cheap offer and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.169
 then I'll do it with 8 gb and you 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.120
 can of course then provides one of the 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.940
 or other program behind the gamble 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.010
 let it run, which of course also 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.590
 is very cool and then hold two 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.510
 module that means both will be 64 bit 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.180
 connected and that makes the pc then 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.879
 accordingly a piece faster than 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.449
 power supply I have the 350 watts here 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.669
 corsa vs sirius is a very small one 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:13.769
 power supply so for 30 euros you can 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.739
 Do not say anything and believe me 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.849
 Please the calculator will not be more than 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.979
 Consume 350 watts 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.959
 you need a 500 watt power supply or 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.570
 nor any higher wait at 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.310
 he will not spend anymore 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.230
 that's just the way it is 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.700
 he can not do that either and that 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.230
 Power adapter is also brand power adapter her 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.210
 it guarantees you will 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.970
 not flying in the air corsa is a 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.260
 good manufacturer and you need you there 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.660
 really not a great expensive power supply 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.669
 clean up with 6 700 watts or worse 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.590
 even a cheaper power supply take more 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.580
 watt what then stop by corsas 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.980
 but from any other 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 cheap provider then stop synonymous cheap 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.860
 But holding is more watts 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 So I would prefer to 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.430
 grab the corsa then you have something 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.110
 neat and straight with power supplies 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.810
 you should always not save money 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.580
 but that's just so cheap so that is 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.530
 now no spar alternative or so good 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.120
 yes, and then we come at the end of the day 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.800
 I did not want to end up there now 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.180
 I have one thing on it 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.580
 forget it and go here now 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.260
 just quick on the cart there 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.570
 is still the housing what I am 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.970
 must show you and that is it 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.280
 sharkoon vs 3 for 221 euros so 20 euros 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.660
 You can not say smoothly 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.430
 So a really nice gripe 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.410
 housing if you would see what it would be there 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.560
 there on other housings for 20 euros 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.090
 is that the best and you can 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.140
 of course every other media tower 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.660
 install housing 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.940
 who are upset and want and of course 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.160
 also money but that is the cheapest and 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.830
 most beautiful thing on mindfactory 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.810
 that's why it's inside and out 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.660
 yes everything fits in should everything work 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.410
 and accordingly, it is also in 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.330
 computer installed 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.030
 At the end we come to say and 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.740
 write 550 euro for the computer with 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.630
 a 6 core 3 5 ghz turbo of 3.9 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.490
 if not get me mistaken must 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.510
 I'll see you there too 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.900
 watch and eight gigabytes of ram 1000 gb 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:17.580
 hard disk good mainboard a nice 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.229
 housing the 67 yes so you can more 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.770
 not really for the money 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.180
 to get 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.630
 it is now one gets 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.840
 intel-cpu but as I said I wanted that 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.330
 keep everything cheap and I find 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.490
 the price is always an amd processor 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.200
 even better is simply my opinion 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.300
 you can see it differently here 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.460
 can reinbauen you an intel but 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.300
 that would be so my pc I you in the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.970
 price range 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.919
 can choose and of course with the 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.819
 nice new graphics card which you then 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:50.310
 again, dear friends, see that 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:53.159
 it was only once I let me 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.900
 Please criticism in the comments as well 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.639
 like to criticize the individual parts 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.080
 or something else you can ne 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.900
 pn write or so I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.970
 always over it and otherwise it was 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.409
 first time of mine is the decision 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.889
 friends do it well 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.889
 pure skin
