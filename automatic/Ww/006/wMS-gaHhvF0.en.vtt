00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.850
 Today is behind in my cellar 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.320
 I'll show you a really cool one 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.809
 I've been doing a lot of exercises lately 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.690
 like to do and that is the front 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.699
 Squats of squats are in 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.110
 compared to normal squats one 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.690
 really good alternative 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.700
 especially because they are not 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.560
 so much on the butt and because 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.160
 Do not so much on the spine 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.530
 go 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.539
 I want to show now how a clean 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.430
 look up front squat 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.699
 it is quite a challenging one 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.320
 exercise would be a complete beginner 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.350
 I do not recommend it if you are 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.269
 have some experience in the field then 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.379
 You should definitely put them in one 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.719
 install program 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.940
 I'll show you now like a front 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.129
 Squat works at the front 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.469
 It is so that especially that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.269
 the right grip is the key 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.670
 there are different possibilities 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.100
 I can either be classical in the me 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.899
 I can cross the arms too 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.999
 Just do the hands forward that is 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.460
 a bit more demanding or im 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.890
 powerlifting I do that very rarely 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.500
 I am not a professional in this I grab that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 whole from behind the important 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.460
 The front squats is that one very 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 Going far behind that is something 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.750
 unpleasant because it of course the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.580
 neck touches if you are too far ahead 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 go and I have the error in the beginning 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.200
 made on and the weight is heavy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.610
 i cant automatically be forward 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620
 the hands can not hold it anymore 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.090
 and then there is a danger that that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.370
 weight drops to full 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.470
 that's why it's very important far behind 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.720
 to go and by that you go upstairs 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.000
 are you going to have your shoulder here then 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 protects the shoulder, so to speak, from the shoulder 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.410
 fall down and I want to go now 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.600
 show a clean execution 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.190
 that is me over cross now here the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.620
 arms hands try equally 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.540
 grab and then you always look 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.530
 at the front quite at from squats 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.110
 never down 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.060
 because you have to look down 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.850
 elbow automatically with and that is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.710
 not good because the result is if 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.390
 the weight is heavier the weight 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.979
 will then someday in the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.770
 decide and then pass 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.310
 the danger that you are with the weight after 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.380
 front falls 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.720
 It is not a heavy exercise I do 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.330
 now just one that means here 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.000
 the left and right evenly grab that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.430
 is very important because you will be too 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.260
 Remember small weights quickly if you 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.670
 too far left or too far right up 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.540
 right until then you have the whole thing 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.790
 compensate 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.000
 and that can later turn to the left and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.030
 right above all because of that before 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.099
 stay as straight as possible so you go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.690
 upwards is slowly backwards and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:53.260
 then it is already down the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 Back stays straight and up again 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.510
 as soon as you go up, you're off 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.510
 you go down you breathe a 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.150
 The important thing is also the position of the legs 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.500
 that means I have my legs a bit behind 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.420
 the outside the 10 show the outside 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.670
 it has a very simple reason for that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:37.959
 Here too the knees follow many 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.430
 People do it all tighter and narrower 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.840
 By that weight at some point 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.450
 higher will go down you go up 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.370
 And here the danger passes the knee 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.300
 go together and they will eventually 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.360
 in safe 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.209
 that's why the whole thing should go outside 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.600
 Show and knees should be whole 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.600
 consequences 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.350
 in that the front squats of 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.570
 the execution forth clearly 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.450
 it is also very demanding sense 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.130
 normal that one creates less weight 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.450
 as with the classic squats 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.140
 that is when you are at classic 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.330
 squats eg 150 can do it then 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.950
 be quite sure that you are at normal front 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.110
 squats maybe only 80 or 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.230
 100 starts and by that maybe 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.360
 shimmers because it is clear 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.640
 more demanding but I find the exercise 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.260
 the more beautiful 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.480
 I'll show you the legs again 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.550
 position i just showed it to me 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.920
 but an exercise like you the right one 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.830
 position also find in the ground 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.440
 position is about it as soon as you go down 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.250
 that's really going to go to the knee 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.920
 go outside 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.740
 that means you go down with it 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.330
 Dry exercises and squeeze a little the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.690
 kneel out so you can 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.580
 practicing position is natural 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.210
 also a matter of practice that is at the beginning 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.440
 It can happen that you are the one 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.390
 front squats do you go you go 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.110
 down and then it works here too 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.410
 again 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.650
 the goal should be that you the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.100
 force so that the knee claus Holst 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.540
 always show the outside and there 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.730
 Of course something had to be yours 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.890
 find position that means there are people 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.920
 they want something closer and there is 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.210
 People go a bit further out 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.050
 But the position of the knee should be 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.530
 be as clear 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.540
 and there should be your power as well 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.120
 go which means I focused on 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.669
 at the beginning really with little weight 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.040
 but to see that the children 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.840
 go outside 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.310
 I hope now with this video
