00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
smallest ones that we actually have so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780 
smallest ones that we actually have so
as<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.409> see<00:02:47.469> it's<00:02:47.829> um<00:02:48.069> it's<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.639> is

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
as you can see it's um it's a it is

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.809 
as you can see it's um it's a it is
still<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> big<00:02:49.389> bat<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.159> down<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> concave

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
still a big bat we go down the concave

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.559 
still a big bat we go down the concave
in<00:02:52.030> here<00:02:52.299> plenty<00:02:53.109> of<00:02:53.199> concave<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:54.329> very<00:02:55.329> high

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
in here plenty of concave in very high

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.830 
in here plenty of concave in very high
spying<00:02:55.959> lots<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.319> concave<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.569> which<00:02:58.569> and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
spying lots of concave in which and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.869 
spying lots of concave in which and
which<00:02:58.989> actually<00:02:59.439> it<00:02:59.620> helps<00:02:59.919> the<00:03:00.040> pick<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.400> this

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
which actually it helps the pick up this

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.550 
which actually it helps the pick up this
patter<00:03:01.120> two-pound<00:03:01.629> tents<00:03:01.930> got<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.109> very<00:03:02.349> nice

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
patter two-pound tents got a very nice

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.259 
patter two-pound tents got a very nice
pick<00:03:02.859> up<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:04.469> round<00:03:05.469> handle<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.090> miss

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
pick up and round handle so you miss

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.990 
pick up and round handle so you miss
most<00:03:07.449> of<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:07.840> age<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.010> bats<00:03:09.219> very<00:03:09.519> good<00:03:09.760> pick

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
most of the age and bats very good pick

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.429 
most of the age and bats very good pick
up<00:03:10.199> yeah

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
up yeah

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.289 
up yeah

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
like you're to tank for a big bat that's

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.099 
like you're to tank for a big bat that's
that's<00:03:20.889> very<00:03:21.159> very<00:03:21.340> good<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.759> also<00:03:22.479> as<00:03:22.930> well

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
that's very very good and also as well

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.809 
that's very very good and also as well
the<00:03:23.379> as<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.769> say<00:03:23.949> before<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:24.400> all<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.579> CA

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
the as you say before and all the CA

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.949 
the as you say before and all the CA
bats<00:03:25.209> these<00:03:26.049> bats<00:03:26.409> are<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:27.250> little<00:03:28.120> smaller<00:03:28.629> on

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
bats these bats are a little smaller on

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.860 
bats these bats are a little smaller on
the<00:03:29.560> blade<00:03:29.829> they<00:03:30.729> are<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:30.939> little<00:03:31.150> shorter<00:03:31.689> I'll

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the blade they are a little shorter I'll

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.749 
the blade they are a little shorter I'll
just<00:03:32.049> demonstrate<00:03:32.199> this<00:03:32.739> now<00:03:32.799> over<00:03:33.729> here<00:03:35.759> just

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:36.759 
just demonstrate this now over here just

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.460 
just demonstrate this now over here just
demonstrate<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:37.419> with<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.689> normal<00:03:37.989> short

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
demonstrate this with a normal short

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.149 
demonstrate this with a normal short
handle<00:03:38.769> bat

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
handle bat

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.469 
handle bat
as<00:03:39.909> you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.180> see<00:03:41.129> shorter<00:03:42.129> now<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.299> just

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
as you can see shorter now this is just

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.719 
as you can see shorter now this is just
primarily<00:03:44.349> because<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.799> they<00:03:45.129> made<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.609> the

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
primarily because of they made in the

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.849 
primarily because of they made in the
Asian<00:03:46.060> markets<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:46.689> and<00:03:46.840> they<00:03:47.319> shorter

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
Asian markets and and they shorter

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.449 
Asian markets and and they shorter
people<00:03:48.669> in<00:03:48.819> general<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.919> like<00:03:50.919> it's<00:03:51.129> good<00:03:51.280> for

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
people in general and like it's good for

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.039 
people in general and like it's good for
me<00:03:51.579> as<00:03:51.669> well<00:03:51.819> because<00:03:52.000> I'm<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.180> shorty<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:52.810> this

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
me as well because I'm a shorty so this

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.860 
me as well because I'm a shorty so this
would<00:03:53.199> be<00:03:53.349> fantastic<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:54.129> me<00:03:54.159> as<00:03:54.340> well<00:03:54.540> or<00:03:55.540> I

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
would be fantastic for me as well or I

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170 
would be fantastic for me as well or I
