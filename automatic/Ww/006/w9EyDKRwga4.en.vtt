00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
all right folks what we have here is a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.040 
all right folks what we have here is a
code<00:00:13.950> block<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.960> nine<00:00:16.890> numbers<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:18.900> can

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
code block and as nine numbers you can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.859 
code block and as nine numbers you can
use<00:00:19.230> your<00:00:19.439> keypad<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.310> your<00:00:21.210> keyboard<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
use your keypad on your keyboard to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.400 
use your keypad on your keyboard to
associate<00:00:22.410> numbers<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.100> reset<00:00:23.970> button<00:00:24.199> we<00:00:25.199> do

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
associate numbers a reset button we do

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.250 
associate numbers a reset button we do
the<00:00:25.830> code<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.619> 7385<00:00:33.260> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the code on this one here is 7385 and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
the code on this one here is 7385 and
see<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.829> opens<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.480> fruit

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
see it opens this you can use this fruit

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.440 
see it opens this you can use this fruit
but<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.190> usually<00:00:38.520> chooses<00:00:39.059> lock

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
but if you want usually chooses lock

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
but if you want usually chooses lock
your<00:00:39.690> doors<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.489> you'll<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.770> i<00:00:43.890> put

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
your doors and you'll see that if i put

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.470 
your doors and you'll see that if i put
in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> wrong<00:00:44.940> code<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.820> talk<00:00:48.090> before

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
in the wrong code it will talk before

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.139 
in the wrong code it will talk before
reset<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.289> nothing<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.860> put<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.730> same

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
reset that's nothing I put in the same

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
reset that's nothing I put in the same
numbers<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.930> wrong<00:00:52.170> order<00:00:54.620> doesn't<00:00:55.620> work

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
numbers but I wrong order doesn't work

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.860 
numbers but I wrong order doesn't work
it<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.570> order<00:00:58.260> specific<00:01:00.739> and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
it has to be it is order specific and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.460 
it has to be it is order specific and
see<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> show<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:06.470> inside

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
see I will go in and show you all inside

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.010 
see I will go in and show you all inside
of<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020 

okay<00:01:12.649> so<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.920> way<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.159> works<00:01:13.219> is<00:01:13.609> based<00:01:13.850> off

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
okay so the way this works is based off

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.660 
okay so the way this works is based off
the<00:01:14.149> concept<00:01:14.689> of<00:01:14.810> tumblers<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.409> lock<00:01:15.670> you've

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the concept of tumblers in a lock you've

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.779 
the concept of tumblers in a lock you've
got<00:01:17.020> RS<00:01:18.020> latches<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.799> when<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.399> put<00:01:19.609> in<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
got RS latches that when you put in the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.260 
got RS latches that when you put in the
correct<00:01:19.909> number<00:01:20.469> flips<00:01:21.469> it<00:01:21.590> over<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.189> then

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
correct number flips it over and then

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.959 
correct number flips it over and then
has<00:01:23.270> mange<00:01:23.570> cloisonne<00:01:24.409> gate<00:01:24.649> what's<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:25.399> and

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
has mange cloisonne gate what's it and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.120 
has mange cloisonne gate what's it and
why<00:01:26.119> was<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.360> number<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:26.810> be<00:01:26.929> flips<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.530> so

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
why was this number to be flips and so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.090 
why was this number to be flips and so
on<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:28.549> forth<00:01:28.929> this<00:01:29.929> is<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.289> pulse<00:01:30.560> extender

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
on and so forth this is a pulse extender

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.980 
on and so forth this is a pulse extender
set<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.789> timer<00:01:31.939> two<00:01:32.149> one<00:01:32.299> release<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.780> want

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
set this timer two one release you want

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.949 
set this timer two one release you want
this<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.250> safety<00:01:34.610> system<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.509> counts<00:01:35.899> the

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
this is the safety system it counts the

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.199 
this is the safety system it counts the
floor<00:01:36.319> if<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.679> put<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.069> four<00:01:37.490> numbers<00:01:37.939> it

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
floor if you put in four numbers it

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.880 
floor if you put in four numbers it
resets<00:01:38.689> if<00:01:39.079> those<00:01:39.259> four<00:01:39.469> numbers<00:01:39.500> where

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
resets if those four numbers where

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.020 
resets if those four numbers where
what's<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.700> Christ<00:01:41.000> ones<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.819> don't

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
what's the Christ ones then you don't

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.190 
what's the Christ ones then you don't
