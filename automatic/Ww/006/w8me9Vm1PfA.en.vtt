00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
going over that but I will be focusing

going over that but I will be focusing
on<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.670> win<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> game<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:30.660> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
more teammates that feed and then hinder

more teammates that feed and then hinder
your<00:00:32.610> efforts<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.180> try<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> carry<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:33.870> by

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
your efforts to try to carry them by

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
your efforts to try to carry them by
doing<00:00:34.590> things<00:00:34.739> such<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:34.980> ignoring<00:00:35.460> calls<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
doing things such as ignoring calls and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
doing things such as ignoring calls and
refusing<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> communicate<00:00:37.520> before<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> get

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
refusing to communicate before I get

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
refusing to communicate before I get
into<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.600> must<00:00:39.960> mention<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
into any of this I must mention that I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
into any of this I must mention that I
strongly<00:00:41.100> encourage<00:00:41.280> duo<00:00:41.820> queueing<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
strongly encourage duo queueing in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
strongly encourage duo queueing in
ranked<00:00:42.570> play<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.829> reduces<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
ranked play it really just reduces the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
ranked play it really just reduces the
amount<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> trolls<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> ridiculous<00:00:45.930> amount

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
amount of trolls by a ridiculous amount

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
amount of trolls by a ridiculous amount
and<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.829> makes<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.460> easier<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.969> carry<00:00:48.239> if

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and it makes it a lot easier to carry if

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
and it makes it a lot easier to carry if
anything<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> person

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
anything you just know that the person

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
anything you just know that the person
that<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> kid<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.690> to

that you do a kid with is going to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110 
that you do a kid with is going to
listen<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> course<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.760> video

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is not about duo queueing it's about

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.139 
is not about duo queueing it's about
carrying<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.250> horrible<00:00:56.489> teammates<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you have no clue how they ended up in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.380 
you have no clue how they ended up in
their<00:00:58.770> division<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> note

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
their division the first thing to note

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
their division the first thing to note
is<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> good<00:01:01.320> chance<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.710> winning

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
is that to have a good chance of winning

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.390 
is that to have a good chance of winning
it<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.420> absolutely<00:01:03.420> crucial<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.189> win

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it is absolutely crucial that you win

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
it is absolutely crucial that you win
your<00:01:05.580> lane<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> can't<00:01:06.659> win<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:07.110> lane<00:01:07.290> try

your lane if you can't win your lane try
to<00:01:07.979> win<00:01:08.189> someone<00:01:08.490> else's<00:01:08.850> link<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.540> becomes

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
to win someone else's link it becomes

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
to win someone else's link it becomes
pretty<00:01:10.020> much<00:01:10.140> impossible<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.860> carry<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
pretty much impossible to carry when the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
pretty much impossible to carry when the
score<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.850> 2<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> 20<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> score

is like 8 to 15 and you're 400 or better
you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> create<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.680> lot<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> opportunities

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you can create a lot of opportunities

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
you can create a lot of opportunities
for<00:01:17.759> both<00:01:18.060> yourself<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.780> team<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
for both yourself and your team this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
for both yourself and your team this
also<00:01:20.729> creates<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> dynamic<00:01:21.240> where<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.810> much

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
also creates a dynamic where it's much

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.630 
also creates a dynamic where it's much
harder<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> solo<00:01:22.710> care<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.340> playing

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
harder to solo care when you are playing

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
harder to solo care when you are playing
bottling<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.780> lane<00:01:24.930> unfortunately

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bottling because your lane unfortunately

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
bottling because your lane unfortunately
relies<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.009> another<00:01:26.310> player<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
relies on another player but you just

relies on another player but you just
have<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> play<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> best<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.650> after

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
have to play the best you can after

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
have to play the best you can after
you've<00:01:29.640> won<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:29.970> lane<00:01:30.119> assuming<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.049> all

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you've won your lane assuming that all

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
you've won your lane assuming that all
attempts<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> make<00:01:31.979> calls<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> communicate

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
attempts to make calls and communicate

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
attempts to make calls and communicate
have<00:01:33.000> failed<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.470> haven't<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
have failed and if they haven't you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
have failed and if they haven't you
should<00:01:35.130> focus<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> instead<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
should focus on that instead as it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
should focus on that instead as it's
much<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.619> likely<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> help<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> win<00:01:38.520> but

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
much more likely to help you win but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
much more likely to help you win but
when<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.540> totally<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> luck<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> even

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
when you're totally out of luck and even

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.800 
when you're totally out of luck and even
though<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.970> happen<00:01:42.119> nearly<00:01:42.630> as

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
though this doesn't happen nearly as

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.780 
though this doesn't happen nearly as
often<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.229> people<00:01:43.380> say<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> does<00:01:43.920> especially

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
often as people say it does especially

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
often as people say it does especially
if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.090> queue<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> still<00:01:46.290> does<00:01:46.439> happen

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
if you do queue it still does happen

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.310 
if you do queue it still does happen
solo<00:01:47.640> caring<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.509> course<00:01:48.780> different<00:01:49.079> for

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
solo caring is of course different for

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
solo caring is of course different for
each<00:01:49.350> role<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.640> split<00:01:50.970> push<00:01:51.180> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
each role if you can split push I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
each role if you can split push I
definitely<00:01:52.049> recommend<00:01:52.320> doing<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
definitely recommend doing that as it's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.010 
definitely recommend doing that as it's
an<00:01:53.670> amazing<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.360> generate<00:01:54.780> pressure

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
an amazing way to generate pressure

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.469 
an amazing way to generate pressure
split<00:01:55.860> pushing<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.369> probably<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> best<00:01:57.299> way

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
split pushing is probably the best way

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
split pushing is probably the best way
to<00:01:57.540> carry<00:01:57.810> by<00:01:57.930> yourself<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.310> need<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to carry by yourself you do need to be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
to carry by yourself you do need to be
extremely<00:02:00.360> aware<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.960> team<00:02:01.170> though<00:02:01.350> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
extremely aware of your team though so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.920 
extremely aware of your team though so
that<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.189> fight<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.670> v5<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.810> they

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that they don't fight for v5 or if they

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
that they don't fight for v5 or if they
do<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.710> least<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:05.070> multiple<00:02:05.460> towers

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
do you can at least get multiple towers

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.940 
do you can at least get multiple towers
or<00:02:05.969> an<00:02:06.210> inhibitor<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:07.469> make<00:02:07.619> sure<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
or an inhibitor just make sure that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
or an inhibitor just make sure that
you're<00:02:08.099> able<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> escape<00:02:08.640> every<00:02:09.179> single<00:02:09.509> gank

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that you have to buy wards

that you have to buy wards

if you're a dual queue you can roam

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.410 
if you're a dual queue you can roam
together<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.370> try<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.550> make<00:02:15.760> plays<00:02:16.030> with<00:02:16.240> the

win your lanes you can likely to be

win your lanes you can likely to be
threesome<00:02:22.450> people<00:02:22.690> as<00:02:22.750> well<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.200> long<00:02:23.470> as

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
threesome people as well as long as

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.050 
threesome people as well as long as
you're<00:02:23.710> aware<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.040> everyone's<00:02:24.400> strengths<00:02:24.910> if

you're aware of everyone's strengths if

you're aware of everyone's strengths if
you<00:02:25.480> can't<00:02:25.900> split<00:02:26.320> push<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:27.700> of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
you can't split push and this is kind of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.670 
you can't split push and this is kind of
mainly<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.300> supports<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:29.140> also<00:02:29.410> applies<00:02:29.650> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
mainly for supports but also applies to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.830 
mainly for supports but also applies to
other<00:02:29.860> roles<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.280> well<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:31.270> thing<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.690> do

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
other roles as well one thing you can do

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.290 
other roles as well one thing you can do
is<00:02:32.020> buy<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> ton<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.830> wards<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.640> constantly

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
is buy a ton of wards and constantly

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.380 
is buy a ton of wards and constantly
ward<00:02:34.570> every<00:02:35.260> area<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.800> map<00:02:35.970> yeah<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.030> will

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
ward every area on the map yeah you will

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330 
ward every area on the map yeah you will
be<00:02:37.540> weak<00:02:37.750> from<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:37.990> lack<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.260> items<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
be weak from the lack of items but the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
be weak from the lack of items but the
vision<00:02:39.670> will<00:02:39.880> be<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.180> huge<00:02:40.780> advantage<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.350> your

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
vision will be a huge advantage for your

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.920 
vision will be a huge advantage for your
team<00:02:41.970> throughout<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.240> it's<00:02:43.480> important<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
team throughout this it's important that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.420 
team throughout this it's important that
you<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.440> very<00:02:44.620> least<00:02:44.830> try<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you have the very least try to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.550 
you have the very least try to
communicate<00:02:45.760> with<00:02:46.150> your<00:02:46.240> team<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.690> do<00:02:47.170> not

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
communicate with your team and do not

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.880 
communicate with your team and do not
rage<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.760> them<00:02:48.990> pings<00:02:49.990> can<00:02:50.230> often<00:02:50.560> be<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> good

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
rage at them pings can often be a good

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.200 
rage at them pings can often be a good
way<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.040> communicate<00:02:51.250> with<00:02:51.640> people<00:02:51.910> who<00:02:52.030> don't

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
way to communicate with people who don't

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.150 
way to communicate with people who don't
listen<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.780> maybe<00:02:53.320> sometime<00:02:53.800> through<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
listen and maybe sometime through the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380 
listen and maybe sometime through the
game<00:02:54.280> they<00:02:54.430> will<00:02:54.610> start<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.000> listen<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.300> your

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
game they will start to listen to your

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.890 
game they will start to listen to your
calls<00:02:56.040> however<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.580> still<00:02:58.240> refuse<00:02:58.600> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
calls however if they still refuse to
