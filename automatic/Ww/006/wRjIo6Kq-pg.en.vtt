00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello how about now let's go quickly with some principles for 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.869
 help facilitate 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.759
 those who see touching 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.759
 the so-called 'false harmonics a whistle their 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.800
 moved from datum 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.140
 this month we are not two things something that rubs the rope and something that makes it vibrate 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 in a harmonic natural min 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.009
 for example we can force a loan agreement 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 above the 5th bar you adopt 4 5 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.030
 we are going to listen to it 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 it gives us some natural bush 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 we have another car 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.970
 of all this hands is dedicating 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.520
 to brush the rope 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.460
 and the other hand to hold the rope 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.880
 country another option to do that 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.470
 which would be for example 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.680
 with hand 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.630
 or with the hand that always 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.820
 we track 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.130
 brush the rope 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.050
 without wanting it is barely touching the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.700
 and with the little finger 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 pull the rope 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.080
 that in mind is very impractical 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.090
 illia harmonic weights are traversed as we go doing 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.870
 preserve different chords 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.180
 we go to harmonics 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.780
 false calls like this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.980
 but what are we going to do 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.730
 with one hand 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.380
 and it depends a lot on the note you're targeting cta 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 it does it with one hand we are going to divide the two options 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.010
 or let's unite the forgiveness 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.550
 brush the rope 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.380
 and the tap it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.830
 we are going to do it 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.710
 with a shorter pen position 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.960
 instead of using the nib very out very solid 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.400
 let's use 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 as close as you can barely peek 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.850
 at the time of touching the string we also go to rosary 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.319
 then it would be like 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
 an agreement here instead of touching it 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.009
 with the very long nib 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.649
 I will be the very short nib 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:23.329
 why at the moment that we touch is almost simultaneous 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.939
 trace the cultu theater 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 The shorter the rowing, the easier it will be to discover this 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.529
 sound 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.249
 Obviously tickets are going to cost a little work it was going to sound very wet 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.679
 the guitar but as we go 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.429
 asking him 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.899
 let's understand 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.239
 slowly 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.019
 this technique 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.239
 they are going to save the harmonics 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.269
 he tells them that it is independent where we put this hand 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.640
 because if the harmonics are fixed, they can change 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.580
 independently it is wrong 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.989
 let's move the let's say let's say on the fifth fret 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.830
 and if you set the harmonic you are going to give almost where to go where we are 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.199
 p 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.670
 obviously not all are functional 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.670
 some would be just others enter very dirty 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.549
 the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.539
 main references k 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.939
 already having more or less the idea as his brother samuel cultural 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.949
 is the sound that 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.439
 we are going to look for doing it with the short nib rubbing the same 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.299
 weather 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.299
 that the point years 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.589
 and this last chili have a harmonic 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:03.569
 is not more 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.569
 use the lever and dang different friends 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.150
 until next time
