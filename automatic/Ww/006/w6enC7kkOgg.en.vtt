of<00:00:49.630> this<00:00:49.960> roast<00:00:50.410> has<00:00:50.740> some<00:00:51.070> fat<00:00:51.370> on<00:00:51.400> there<00:00:51.880> but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
of this roast has some fat on there but

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.390 
of this roast has some fat on there but
it's<00:00:52.330> pretty<00:00:52.960> thin<00:00:53.350> layer<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:53.980> I<00:00:54.010> don't<00:00:54.250> think

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
it's pretty thin layer so I don't think

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.170 
it's pretty thin layer so I don't think
it's<00:00:54.580> really<00:00:56.010> enough<00:00:57.010> to<00:00:57.250> bother<00:00:57.490> with<00:00:57.850> trying

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
it's really enough to bother with trying

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.360 
it's really enough to bother with trying
to<00:00:58.300> screw<00:00:58.690> around<00:00:58.720> and<00:00:59.170> trim<00:00:59.470> it<00:00:59.590> off<00:00:59.800> I'm<00:01:00.220> just

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
to screw around and trim it off I'm just

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.220 
to screw around and trim it off I'm just
gonna<00:01:00.460> leave<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.700> on<00:01:00.910> there<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.300> season

a meat thermometer in there this does
have<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.660> those<00:02:25.870> pop-up<00:02:26.230> timers<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
have one of those pop-up timers but I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.000 
have one of those pop-up timers but I
don't<00:02:27.580> really<00:02:27.700> trust<00:02:28.060> those<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.570> much<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.260> my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
don't really trust those that much so my

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.680 
don't really trust those that much so my
plan<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> cook<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.620> 145<00:02:33.060> degrees<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.570> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
plan is to cook it to 145 degrees on the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.759 
plan is to cook it to 145 degrees on the
meat<00:02:34.870> thermometer<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.989> there's<00:02:37.989> quite<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.620> bit

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
meat thermometer and there's quite a bit

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.979 
meat thermometer and there's quite a bit
of<00:02:39.040> liquid<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.519> there<00:02:39.940> from<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.390> soup<00:02:40.750> I'm

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
of liquid in there from the soup I'm

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.199 
of liquid in there from the soup I'm
hoping<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.470> didn't<00:02:41.920> overfill<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.150> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
hoping I didn't overfill that and it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.060 
hoping I didn't overfill that and it
doesn't<00:02:43.510> start<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> overflow<00:02:44.290> that'll<00:02:44.920> make<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
doesn't start to overflow that'll make a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.570 
doesn't start to overflow that'll make a
nice<00:02:45.340> mess<00:02:46.019> me<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.170> my<00:02:47.260> big<00:02:47.590> ideas<00:02:48.100> here

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
nice mess me and my big ideas here

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.460 
nice mess me and my big ideas here
I<00:02:48.610> guess<00:02:49.330> if<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.630> happens<00:02:50.019> I'll<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.290> have

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
I guess if that happens I'll just have

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.840 
I guess if that happens I'll just have
to<00:02:50.620> open<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:50.950> up<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.720> spoon<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> little<00:02:53.049> bit<00:02:53.170> out

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
to open it up and spoon a little bit out

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.560 
to open it up and spoon a little bit out

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the really handy thing about using the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.509 
the really handy thing about using the
toaster<00:03:01.269> oven<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.690> cook<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.250> see

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
toaster oven to cook this is I can see

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.370 
toaster oven to cook this is I can see
the<00:03:03.730> meat<00:03:03.970> thermometer<00:03:04.180> right<00:03:04.900> through<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
the meat thermometer right through the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.860 
the meat thermometer right through the
glass<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.670> don't<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.180> open<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.690> door

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
glass so I don't have to open the door

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.110 
glass so I don't have to open the door
like<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> would<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> big<00:03:08.920> oven<00:03:09.310> or<00:03:09.640> even<00:03:10.000> on
