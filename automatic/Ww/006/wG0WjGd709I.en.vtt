00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:48.269 
basically the precision this game is

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.979 
basically the precision this game is
very<00:06:48.959> bad<00:06:49.699> q<00:06:50.699> pi<00:06:50.939> just<00:06:50.999> tap<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.509> left<00:06:51.629> button

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:51.989 
very bad q pi just tap the left button

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:55.579 
very bad q pi just tap the left button
that's<00:06:52.739> how<00:06:52.919> far<00:06:53.129> you<00:06:53.309> move<00:06:54.110> and<00:06:55.110> that's<00:06:55.469> when

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:55.589 
that's how far you move and that's when

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:56.899 
that's how far you move and that's when
you're<00:06:55.709> running<00:06:56.009> but<00:06:56.129> if<00:06:56.249> you're<00:06:56.369> walking<00:06:56.519> it

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
you're running but if you're walking it

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.779 
you're running but if you're walking it
doesn't<00:06:57.389> move<00:06:57.509> quite<00:06:58.349> as<00:06:58.499> far<00:06:58.679> but<00:06:59.489> you<00:06:59.639> need

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
doesn't move quite as far but you need

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:00.889 
doesn't move quite as far but you need
to<00:06:59.909> be<00:07:00.029> running<00:07:00.329> to<00:07:00.419> get<00:07:00.539> through<00:07:00.719> a<00:07:00.749> lot<00:07:00.869> of
