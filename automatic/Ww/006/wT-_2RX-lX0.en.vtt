00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
first-person shooter that you could play

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.979 
first-person shooter that you could play
basically<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.090> control<00:04:15.510> shouldn't<00:04:15.900> be

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
basically so the control shouldn't be

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.449 
basically so the control shouldn't be
too<00:04:16.169> confusing<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.889> you're<00:04:17.010> familiar<00:04:17.160> with

the first person shooter as I said with
the<00:04:20.220> graphics<00:04:20.700> there<00:04:20.880> was<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> lot<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.329> texture

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
the graphics there was a lot of texture

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.610 
the graphics there was a lot of texture
poppins<00:04:22.520> sometimes<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:24.000> know<00:04:24.320> enemies<00:04:25.320> would

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
poppins sometimes you know enemies would

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.980

because<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.450> was<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:31.850> pixelated<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.389> then

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
because it was that pixelated and then

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.960 
because it was that pixelated and then
it<00:04:33.750> popped<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.500> even<00:04:35.100> one<00:04:35.370> time<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.850> my

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it popped in and even one time one of my

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.150 
it popped in and even one time one of my
characters<00:04:36.240> was<00:04:36.780> completely<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.860> white

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
characters was completely just white

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.890 
characters was completely just white
time<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.880> white<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> piece<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.630> paper

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
time just white like a piece of paper

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.170 
time just white like a piece of paper
and<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:40.889> took<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.100> good<00:04:41.220> three<00:04:41.520> or<00:04:41.550> four<00:04:41.850> minutes

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
and it took a good three or four minutes

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.260 
and it took a good three or four minutes
before<00:04:42.479> he<00:04:42.600> finally<00:04:42.990> textured<00:04:43.800> in<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.310> was

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
before he finally textured in and was

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.690
