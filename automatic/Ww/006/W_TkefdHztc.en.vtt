that can mesh well do like a sleek
modern<00:01:51.840> vibe<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> finishings<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
natural wood elements I think this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
natural wood elements I think this
picture<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> actually<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.600> successful

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
picture is actually really successful

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
picture is actually really successful

have<00:02:00.509> vintage<00:02:01.469> elements<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> sense<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
have vintage elements in the sense that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
have vintage elements in the sense that
the<00:02:03.689> chairs<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.380> mismatched

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
