00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.930
 welcome to the new election of the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.340
 tongue itself I hope that with beard I 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.340
 they create more than before 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 start with the right ends with the 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.859
 right has two doubles in the middle 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.150
 louis top then let's add a 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.150
 extra note with the left hand 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.970
 easy and then we fill with the gift of 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.970
 air and the first floor 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 Y 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.940
 the second example deals with one thing 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.580
 like a flame a figure like a 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.770
 flan led by the right hand sounds 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.450
 that I heard it for the first time 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.869
 billy cobham when he played with the most 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.869
 chasms 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.580
 extremely simple between these three 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.580
 drums 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 all the notes 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.850
 what are you going to play with the right hand are 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.360
 hard and almost all you're going to take 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.900
 touch with the left are ghosts is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.900
 the figure 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.859
 ah 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.600
 If I feel it, everything is led by the 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:02:02.429
 faster right hand starts ringing 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.649
 this is a very simple lic too but 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.219
 who is employed to give the notion that is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.219
 more complex 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 the idea of selic is that it sounds plump 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.600
 until the end and finish it with 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 triplets 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.340
 it's cool because they are extremely 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 dramatic 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.550
 They are groups of six notes 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.690
 since they start with the right they end 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.489
 with the left 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.010
 we accentuate the first note with the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.209
 right whenever it's a unison between 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:50.120
 the right hand in the stack and the hype 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:50.120
 then at speed 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.270
 is to practice that a lot to get to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.550
 play with speed and with strength 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.010
 you need to practice on surfaces that 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.010
 do not bounce and with heavy sticks 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.450
 the other part that is very interesting is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 I took it out or I heard it for the first time 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.860
 to the drummer bill bruford of king 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.860
 crimson 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.900
 123 he just listened like that he does not have 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.689
 a lot of sense if a normal sound like 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.400
 confused sixteenths and I very 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.500
 interesting but in the musical context 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.370
 we realize that they are three figures 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.370
 so 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:54.420
 unison the right below and the left 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:59.599
 respond to practice it in your mind 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.599
 you have to count a 2 3 1 2 3 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.370
 additional 4 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.710
 hands together network and raid 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.080
 after the right touches ride has 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.400
 immediately upside down and it reaches the 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.400
 left with two strokes at the end 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.830
 the last lick that is made is one of the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.830
 simpler leaks 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.679
 that if you do all hands together 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.670
 extremely dramatic 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.069
 3 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.479
 look 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.870
 if not 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.590
 once 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.130
 Y 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.130
 Y 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.990
 summer 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.290
 comes 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.440
 Y
