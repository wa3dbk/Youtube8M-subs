and it is a strong magnet here as you

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.530 
and it is a strong magnet here as you
can<00:00:34.990> see<00:00:35.200> it<00:00:35.290> even<00:00:35.700> grabbed<00:00:36.700> onto<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.390> metal

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
can see it even grabbed onto the metal

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.950 
can see it even grabbed onto the metal
bill<00:00:37.840> there<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.590> when<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:38.890> separate<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.430> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bill there and when you separate it you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.300 
bill there and when you separate it you
have<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.080> two<00:00:41.260> halves<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.650> magnet<00:00:42.130> and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
have the two halves of the magnet and

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.940 
have the two halves of the magnet and
this<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.120> how<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.330> can<00:00:43.660> make<00:00:43.810> it<00:00:43.840> attach<00:00:44.710> to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
this is how you can make it attach to

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.280 
this is how you can make it attach to
any<00:00:45.100> surface<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.580> you<00:00:45.910> want<00:00:46.150> one<00:00:46.720> side<00:00:47.020> goes

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
any surface that you want one side goes

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.920 
any surface that you want one side goes
on<00:00:47.560> one<00:00:47.800> surface<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.520> other<00:00:48.630> holds<00:00:49.630> on<00:00:49.750> to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
on one surface and the other holds on to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.050 
on one surface and the other holds on to
it<00:00:50.020> on<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.200> other<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:51.220> as<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.400> can<00:00:51.610> hear<00:00:51.670> it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
it on the other and as you can hear it's

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.000 
it on the other and as you can hear it's
a<00:00:52.210> credibly<00:00:52.810> strong<00:00:53.170> magnet<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:53.800> will<00:00:53.890> be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
a credibly strong magnet that will be

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
a credibly strong magnet that will be
able<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.190> hold<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.210> together<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:57.040> as<00:00:57.820> we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
able to hold it together so as we

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.700 
able to hold it together so as we
separate<00:00:58.420> here<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.720> this<00:00:58.840> glass<00:00:58.990> table<00:00:59.440> here's

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
separate here on this glass table here's

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.940 
separate here on this glass table here's
the<00:00:59.920> one<00:01:00.100> end<00:01:00.340> underneath<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:02.470> other<00:01:02.620> end

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
the one end underneath and the other end

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.359 
the one end underneath and the other end
on<00:01:03.370> top<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.659> as<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:04.900> can<00:01:05.140> see<00:01:05.199> here<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:06.400> is<00:01:06.820> now

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
on top and as you can see here it is now

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.929 
on top and as you can see here it is now
attached<00:01:09.369> underneath<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.240> table<00:01:10.600> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
attached underneath the table and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.789 
attached underneath the table and
because<00:01:12.939> it's<00:01:13.090> an<00:01:13.179> elastic<00:01:13.570> band<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:14.289> can<00:01:14.469> sway

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
because it's an elastic band it can sway

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.249 
because it's an elastic band it can sway
and<00:01:15.159> roll<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.590> swing<00:01:17.590> back<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:18.069> forth<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:19.259> on

that way you can easily grab it and

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.950 
that way you can easily grab it and
literally<00:01:29.679> move<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.159> around<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.780> other

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
literally move it around on the other

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:44.219 
literally move it around on the other
side<00:01:33.389> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:36.869> tabletop<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:43.329> show<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.719> how

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
side of the tabletop so to show you how

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.120 
side of the tabletop so to show you how
strong<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:45.310> magnet<00:01:45.969> is<00:01:46.499> and<00:01:47.499> the<00:01:47.740> variety<00:01:48.100> of

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
strong this magnet is and the variety of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.889 
strong this magnet is and the variety of
surfaces<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.939> can<00:01:49.119> actually<00:01:49.420> use<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.810> on

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
surfaces that you can actually use it on

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.559 
surfaces that you can actually use it on
I'm<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.530> demonstrate<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:52.420> on

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
I'm going to demonstrate this here on

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.169 
I'm going to demonstrate this here on
our<00:01:52.959> granite<00:01:53.350> kitchen<00:01:53.530> countertop<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
our granite kitchen countertop so the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.389 
our granite kitchen countertop so the
one<00:01:55.359> end<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.499> put<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.130> other<00:01:57.159> end

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
one end and I just put the other end

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.980 
one end and I just put the other end
underneath<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:59.049> as<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.189> can<00:02:00.369> see<00:02:00.609> here<00:02:00.990> even

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
underneath and as you can see here even

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.300 
underneath and as you can see here even
through<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.469> granite<00:02:03.069> countertop<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.740> holds

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
through a granite countertop it holds

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.210 
through a granite countertop it holds
strong

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.940 

and<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.880> really<00:02:10.060> does<00:02:10.390> tell<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.410> how<00:02:11.620> strong

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and that really does tell you how strong

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.670 
and that really does tell you how strong
this<00:02:12.190> magnet<00:02:12.610> actually<00:02:12.820> is<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.410> number

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
this magnet actually is and the number

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470 
this magnet actually is and the number
of<00:02:14.800> surfaces<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.550> actually<00:02:15.700> use<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> play

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
of surfaces you can actually use to play

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.400 
of surfaces you can actually use to play
with<00:02:16.660> your<00:02:16.840> cat<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.690> even<00:02:19.960> still

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
with your cat and you can even still

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.720 
with your cat and you can even still
play<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.580> move<00:02:22.210> with<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.690> even<00:02:23.620> through<00:02:24.100> that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
play and move with it even through that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.110 
play and move with it even through that
thickness<00:02:25.060> right<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:25.990> which<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.410> about<00:02:27.120> an

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
thickness right there which is about an

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.660 
thickness right there which is about an
inch<00:02:28.450> or<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:31.150> granite
