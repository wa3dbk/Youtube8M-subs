00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.040
 Welcome to Löwen before that 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.050
 I have I found ceramic 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.500
 They also like to bake and fry 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.759
 in falun without oil fats or butter 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.770
 to have to add 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.000
 in this ceramic field from löwenthal 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.269
 the profi line is possible and why 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.359
 This Iranian almost remains 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.759
 not even if they are not liable 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.730
 no butter no oil or fat 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 add to show that 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:42.490
 Let's do some extreme tests as well 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:51.970
 we melt cheese too 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:54.190
 right now no such a real one 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:00.100
 extreme test is that we are not here 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.230
 burn like burn me here and then 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.140
 we even burn it with 1 crème 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.579
 brulee burner we burn that too 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:13.000
 that way and then that can be with you 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.009
 Kitchen towel quite easy to clean makes 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.009
 make make easily clean with 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.960
 kitchen paper so in the meantime can 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.390
 I need them one 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.479
 little time i can take them to me 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.600
 lions of löwenthal explain lions there 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.479
 already has a ceramic flag on the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.880
 market this is this millionfold 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.159
 sold worldwide but now we have 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.890
 then also our profile 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.490
 and the profi line is a serious one 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.560
 breakdown 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.829
 You can also see it here very well 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.310
 a much thicker edge than here 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:53.350
 Another banner has said the profiLine came 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 in different sizes 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.659
 he sees the way in his 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.909
 packaging out of this is the 20 here 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.289
 centimeter average then I have 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.890
 here still 1 24 centimeters average 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:12.070
 28 inches and my peace is 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.820
 this week also 28 centimeters in the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.760
 we also ran glass lid 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.700
 to 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 the glass ceiling is in the size 24 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.730
 and 28 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.989
 and they even have a fume out here 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.329
 let this 28 inch glass ceiling is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.440
 also suitable for wok by the way 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:42.440
 nothing sticks here we stick family 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.780
 Watching them once they see and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:52.879
 Cheese cheese the dancing and here 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.099
 in the pan super the milk must 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.340
 I can still give them a little more 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:03.040
 what do the flags say are for everyone 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.230
 also suitable for induction 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 The magnet is also proving forever 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.299
 already suitable we have him the fun 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.629
 are made of aluminum and then we have 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.470
 the double with ceramic history too 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.659
 double ceramic coating 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.389
 aluminum why aluminum aluminum very much 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.430
 good heat distributor and while yourself 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.569
 also very quickly so that they too 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.449
 I can cook energy saving energy 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.609
 Of course, the pans are 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.319
 dishwasher safe but why should 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.269
 they do that because that 's in the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.389
 Dishwasher cleaning takes sometimes 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.799
 even longer than that clean but that 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.810
 I will show them again soon 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.239
 which is also important for him to know us 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.150
 is that we are ergonomic here 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.079
 have molded handle and this 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 handle also has a soft touch like that 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:07.849
 Now you are doing the hard test with me 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:11.079
 and the cheese is done so now 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.079
 Let's test it 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.459
 and then we'll burn it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.370
 and then let 's see if we can just do that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.470
 a bit of kitchen paper again 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.490
 usually they know yes 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.900
 Also a pan if you have one 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.410
 flag would have been with a conventional one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.690
 Non-stick coating then is such a 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.060
 flag in bucket you know that you found 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.759
 the altea coating you know that 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:54.550
 still that dissolves that comes in the food 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:05:02.620
 not exactly healthy but now what 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:07.240
 kitchen paper now happens and it dissolves 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:11.979
 They see that I can do it all 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.199
 out able and the flag is again 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:19.150
 clean 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:22.510
 class just great but what the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:27.760
 Rest simply mix in one with water 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:33.150
 mats fold and the flag is clean 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.840
 and purely on them I would say 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.880
 agony of choice 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.280
 red banners or black banner size 20 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.430
 24 28 without the wok pan or all 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.330
 just order so much cook fun 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.330
 with her ceramic flags of 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.330
