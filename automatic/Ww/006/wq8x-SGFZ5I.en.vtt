00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.950
 the samsung galaxy s3 is the cheapest 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.590
 and smallest device from the new 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.019
 Following samsung it has just like 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.520
 the a5 a nice aluminum case but 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.259
 it seems the price of this device 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.000
 to float up considerably 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.210
 Moreover when the the specifications 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.130
 between budget mid-range and high end or 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 this metal mini samsung is up to you 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.519
 spent depends very much on what 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.130
 you find important 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.290
 in a smartphone because it's handy 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.070
 appearance and selfies many important 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.480
 factors 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.100
 then you are well on your way with this samsung 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.570
 galaxy s3 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.309
 as said, the existing housing 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.649
 complete the aluminum also has 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.000
 beautiful chrome accents and that gives one 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.050
 device really a nice premium 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.899
 appearance 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.030
 moreover, it is nice and thin at 6.9 mm 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.559
 held in the Netherlands comes the device 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.280
 available in the colors black 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.320
 and white 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.770
 but it is also made in silver 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.600
 gold light pink and light blue and it is 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.250
 making a sophia so important and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.840
 then you have a very good one out of 5 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.879
 megapixel camera that is here at the front 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.920
 sit and want with several people 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.640
 at the same time on the photo then you can use 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.530
 make the wide selfie mode with his 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 dimensions of the a3 in what we 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 nowadays the category small 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.000
 call smartphones 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.229
 and I believe that Samsung this as a 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 mini device considered it 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.979
 for example a slightly smaller than 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.690
 the samsung galaxy s5 mini 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.030
 that little leaves is possible because it 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.099
 screen is 4.5 inches tall and that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.649
 screen size is ideal 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.000
 an HD resolution but unfortunately 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.140
 Samsung chose to do it 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.580
 with a lower resolution 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.989
 namely only 540 by 960 pixels and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.060
 That is a resolution that we actually have 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:43.190
 almost exclusively to look back on 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.349
 budget devices or mid-range 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.610
 devices from a while ago 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.349
 on the other hand it is just one 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.209
 super amoled screen from samsung and 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.580
 we know beautiful colors from that 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.380
 nice and clear and a great viewing angle 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.300
 however, we put it next to the a5 with 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
 are HD resolution and we play a video 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.800
 and then the difference in quality 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 clearly noticeable and that is 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.899
 also mind you with its 1.2 g quad-core 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.119
 processor and one and a half 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.129
 memory can make this adria easy 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.540
 along with the current mid-range models and 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.790
 it also appears amply 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.680
 sufficient for most operations 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.630
 the 8 megapixel camera on the back performs 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.540
 perfectly clear and sharp in daylight 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.610
 take pictures 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.099
 my schedule grade quality unfortunately 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.900
 backwards considerably and then you start flashing 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.280
 the device also takes quite a long time 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.129
 to focus and then you will see 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.959
 then you just missed your photo moment at the 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.489
 on the other hand it is neat again 16 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.019
 gigabyte of internal storage in it 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.689
 device and you can also do that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.890
 expand yourself with a memory card 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.720
 and the device also runs a neatly 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.189
 android 4 point four point four with 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.870
 the latest version of it 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.019
 samsung's touchwiz 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.209
 including savings and private positions 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.530
 in terms of design storage space and front camera 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.180
 high end 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.909
 considering the processor power more and more 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.409
 midrange and screen resolution 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.840
 yes that is actually more for one 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.459
 Budget device is the appearance of one 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.959
 your most important smartphone 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.569
 it also doesn't have to be that big 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.310
 then you might be willing to pay 300 euros 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.769
 to spend for this pretty little one 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.379
 samsung which also just 4g 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.669
 is ready and has a good battery life 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.049
 the screen of your device is okay 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.970
 bigger because you often go there, for example 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 watch videos on and may your device 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.419
 some more muscle balls 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.370
 yes then you can do a lot for the same amount 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.530
 and purchase much better devices 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.290
 for example the samsung galaxy s4 with 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 its 5 inch full hd screen and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.209
 faster processor the samsung galaxy s3 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.190
 get an overview of everything and just 3 and 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.810
 half star because we are very happy anyway 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.310
 its that samsung finally some more work 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.000
 makes design 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000
 from smartphones
