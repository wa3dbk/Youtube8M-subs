00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 the so-called one bond 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.129
 it's true 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.020

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 besides whatever she was 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.329
 how do you assess the impact on the market 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.189
 ten 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.059
