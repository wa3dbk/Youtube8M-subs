us about your hormone levels if you're

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.709 
us about your hormone levels if you're
an<00:01:01.339> apple<00:01:01.489> shape<00:01:01.850> you're<00:01:02.059> putting<00:01:02.329> on<00:01:02.420> way<00:01:02.660> too

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
an apple shape you're putting on way too

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.780 
an apple shape you're putting on way too
much<00:01:02.920> fat<00:01:03.920> just<00:01:04.100> right<00:01:04.339> around<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.670> abdomen

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
much fat just right around the abdomen

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.190 
much fat just right around the abdomen
that<00:01:05.119> increases<00:01:05.659> your<00:01:05.689> risk<00:01:06.020> of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
that increases your risk of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.530 
that increases your risk of
cardiovascular<00:01:06.979> disease<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.759> that<00:01:07.790> is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
cardiovascular disease and that is

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.249 
cardiovascular disease and that is
caused<00:01:08.930> by<00:01:09.110> too<00:01:09.170> much<00:01:09.409> cortisol<00:01:10.009> too<00:01:10.850> much<00:01:11.259> or

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
caused by too much cortisol too much or

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.560 
caused by too much cortisol too much or
a<00:01:12.320> deficiency<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:13.070> DHEA<00:01:13.759> which<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.360> another

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
a deficiency of DHEA which is another

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.200 
a deficiency of DHEA which is another
central<00:01:14.990> hormone<00:01:15.350> too<00:01:15.500> much<00:01:15.649> estrogen

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
central hormone too much estrogen

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210 
central hormone too much estrogen
deficiency<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.689> testosterone<00:01:18.079> so<00:01:18.920> we<00:01:19.070> can

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
deficiency of testosterone so we can

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.770 
deficiency of testosterone so we can
figure<00:01:19.399> out<00:01:19.520> which<00:01:19.759> one<00:01:20.060> or<00:01:20.299> maybe<00:01:20.600> it's

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
figure out which one or maybe it's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.410 
figure out which one or maybe it's
combination<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:21.380> all<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.560> those<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:22.420> cortisol

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
combination of all of those and cortisol

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120 
combination of all of those and cortisol
comes<00:01:23.750> from<00:01:23.960> too<00:01:24.079> much<00:01:24.259> stress<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.770> also

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
comes from too much stress and also

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.010 
comes from too much stress and also
comes<00:01:25.369> from<00:01:25.430> eating<00:01:25.729> too<00:01:25.759> much<00:01:26.090> white<00:01:26.659> flour

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
comes from eating too much white flour

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.959 
comes from eating too much white flour
products<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.740> enough<00:01:27.950> whole<00:01:28.189> wheat<00:01:28.490> I've

c-reactive protein a lot of people know

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
c-reactive protein a lot of people know
now<00:02:38.020> that's<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.440> great<00:02:38.830> indicator<00:02:39.190> for<00:02:39.430> heart

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
now that's a great indicator for heart

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.210 
now that's a great indicator for heart

so<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.400> analyze<00:02:54.880> all<00:02:55.120> these<00:02:55.300> things<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.630> find

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
so we analyze all these things to find

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.450 
so we analyze all these things to find
out<00:02:55.960> what's<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.440> problem<00:02:56.680> why<00:02:56.920> are<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.220> on

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
out what's the problem why are you on

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.980 
out what's the problem why are you on
this<00:02:57.610> yo-yo<00:02:57.880> diet<00:02:58.300> why<00:02:58.480> haven't<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.870> been

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
this yo-yo diet why haven't you been

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.440 
this yo-yo diet why haven't you been
able<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.260> lose<00:03:00.040> weight<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.400> keep<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.700> off<00:03:00.850> it

could<00:03:01.690> be<00:03:01.840> hormones<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.560> genetics<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.820> we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
could be hormones and genetics so we

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330 
could be hormones and genetics so we
look<00:03:04.330> at<00:03:04.560> analyzing<00:03:05.560> exactly<00:03:06.010> your<00:03:06.130> bio
