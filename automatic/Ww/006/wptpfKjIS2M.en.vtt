00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
 come dad 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.309
 9 05 04 00 16 those numbers that you have 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.740
 to call if you did not know but it's 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.719
 here below me if you do not know do not call 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.750
 which is a pity you do not have to 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.930
 money in not knowing is sure of you 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.420
 himself and he could hardly believe that he did not 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.310
 you know because it gives even more good that it is not 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.230
 I know if you can say that I love 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.900
 I love it, it's not a clue because 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.040
 can not know whether or not I love it and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.270
 whatever it is I would also love it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 is the program and you win this take the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.710
 phone dial 1 905 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.760
 but good 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.070
 and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.920
 imagining less 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.720
 you have not seen you have not seen the word ha 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.080
 there was a little bit because I gave three 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.540
 super clues this is the word is a 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.670
 we are one of her jump we call and if 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.650
 you know the correct answer move and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 start running because this is the last 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.540
 opportunity 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.020
 you know this word like this 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 lawns do not wait for you because which 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.890
 a shame here is the clock button is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670
 here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.159
 to this one 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 if you know it call now the clock is 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.659
 giving the clock is very little time 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.850
 it means that in a little bit we are going 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.320
 to close so if you want to call 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.320
 now because then you can not anymore 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.049
 the watch you see here next to me wants 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.759
 say that we have very little time left 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.060
 then shortly they are going to do 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.240
 of the lines now now they are still 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 open 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.060
 now they are open so now now 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.340
 you can call so if you already know 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.990
 call now then I'll tell you when not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.640
 more to call three yes you already know 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.659
 call now because now you can still 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.000
 so they are going to do what the lines 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.610
 and come the last chance with the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.490
 I celebrate day 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.490
 05 04 0 0 16 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.700
 you do not know what 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 to finish the time 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.930
 Today in areas where it has had strained and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.770
 do not call it is done 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
 I hope I hope it is also because 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 nothing 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 try to call has been called before 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.640
 because you try to try again 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.160
 that note now enjoy this game 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.550
 he had no luck because before maybe he has not 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.550
 born 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.870
 so this is the second game of the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.930
 night and we're still here because you have 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.830
 seen I look like I 'm lucky 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.730
 because I was doing very well until I knew how to carry 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.290
 both 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.560
 without the opportunity of the card the program 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.189
 during the entire flight the entire flight that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.000
 all the games and I'm flying 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:11.560
 I need a red bull that does not 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.560
 is that I'm flying is that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.490
 but that is coming is the 5000 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.920
 and the thing 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.890
 It's midnight're not going 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.710
 early morning 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.290
 just like you heat does not let you call 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.330
 that's great because I think a lot of people 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.360
 is calling 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.000
 sleeping people are sleeping or 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.030
 maybe others is out there is doing 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.720
 something else I do not know 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.560
 but you are watching I do not know why 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.380
 maybe this has a digital mouse that's 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 a night of luck 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.730
 well give us a clue well come to you 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.570
 helps to see what clue the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.570
 production helps me 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.250
 I have something in my body that gives 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.360
 luck, so how could I play? 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.360
 who knows 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.930
 that is I am going to take 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.459
 and in between I'll see you if the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.880
 word I have can also be 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.370
 studies 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
 no they 're not talking I'm not kidding 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.710
 it's really 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.540
 I do not know how with a warmth of emotion or 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.570
 dry maybe that's why you're not 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.910
 selling better for you better for yourself the 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.780
 word that we are looking for in flames 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.020
 do not tell me it would not be all right 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.020
 nothing bad 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.470
 it's not to bed 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.300
 it would not be bad 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.300
 if you see it, do not wait 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.550
 I like it more 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.960
 you can not say 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.610
 I like zone 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.750
 you can buy everything that the 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.800
 wins because people 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.800
 it is this 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.120
 of those for purchases for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.540
 for the party 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.000
 for 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.370
 the so-called signatures enter that bucket 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.160
 that we have we take them one so 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.540
 throughout he is everything because everything came 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.860
 the cat is flying because they do not see flying here 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.479
 I have my legacy 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.689
 maybe what it is and maybe I can give the 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.300
 night we are well of pital because 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:45.129
