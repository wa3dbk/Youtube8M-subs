00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
in a car like a sane person but yeah he

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.340 
in a car like a sane person but yeah he
used<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> big<00:03:15.269> son<00:03:15.600> cabinet<00:03:16.140> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
used to have the big son cabinet that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.190 
used to have the big son cabinet that
had<00:03:16.560> four<00:03:16.830> 12s<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.870> one<00:03:18.870> day<00:03:18.900> while

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
had four 12s in it and one day while

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.800 
had four 12s in it and one day while
moving<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.700> figured<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.600> one<00:03:21.780> of

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
moving it we we figured out that one of

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.780 
moving it we we figured out that one of
the<00:03:21.989> 12s<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:22.950> hanging<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.580> there

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the 12s was just like hanging in there

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.000 
the 12s was just like hanging in there
and<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.510> opened<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.080> back<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.470> cab<00:03:25.650> and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and we opened up the back of the cab and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.699 
and we opened up the back of the cab and
it<00:03:26.130> was<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.489> some<00:03:27.209> RadioShack<00:03:27.870> speakers<00:03:28.350> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
it was like some RadioShack speakers and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.650 
it was like some RadioShack speakers and
mismatched<00:03:29.100> speakers<00:03:29.580> half<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.360> them<00:03:30.510> are<00:03:30.630> in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
mismatched speakers half of them are in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.000 
mismatched speakers half of them are in
half<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.500> them<00:03:31.650> are<00:03:31.769> wired<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.660> we<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.380> told<00:03:34.890> him

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
half of them are wired so we I told him

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.590 
half of them are wired so we I told him
to<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.190> try<00:03:35.370> out<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> old<00:03:35.880> band<00:03:36.269> master

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
