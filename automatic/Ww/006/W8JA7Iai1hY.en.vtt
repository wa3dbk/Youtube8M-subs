00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome to a 300 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.609
 Subscriber special 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.980
 I thank you very much 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.620
 that really say 300 people 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 I think that's a good idea 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 Now consider that the subscriber numbers 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.599
 really high last time 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 gone though I rarely 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.890
 have uploaded videos look like 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.880
 long does it take to 400 achieved have 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.880
 without uploading a video 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.510
 Anyway, I thought so now 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 what can i do as a 300 special now 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 do 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 That's why I 've got what it 's worth 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 I have been doing some for some time now 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.899
 wanted 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.940
 as you may know, yes 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.590
 three alter egos the scream and mori me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.390
 I thought so that I the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.460
 characters explain a little more so how 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 I came to these characters 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 and what they have for essence for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 what are you doing, I hope so 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.539
 you will hear more and I will catch you 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.300
 now times please my first marriage 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.280
 and there should be a scream 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.589
 Over time , he has also lost his way 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 gradually changed as it was know our 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.479
 time also put 1 nifty there and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
 actually presented my opposite 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.990
 personality is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the videos was always happens 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 it always always went down after that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.290
 shit and me personally 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 Actually, I'm not, I'm rather 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.350
 the restrained guy does that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.490
 things that I would not do 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 Let's get his really in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.070
 my character is currently supposed to be 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.680
 represents an albino and is a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.920
 character of cake entertainment and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 this really speaks my kag the ds 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.130
 restrained, that is quiet so stands 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 to be friendly even if all 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.430
 others are impossible to be under 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.780
 said the mobbing victim of the group 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 he should have originally balt smp 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.900
 actually look very different and also 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 have a place other character 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.880
 originally it was actually a white one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.220
 cat with with a mask and same as 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 Hands around to have the evil knowledge 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 or criminal episode of the episode was 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.479
 then unfortunately at some point abandoned command 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.680
 not to say anything now, anyway 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.740
 I'll think twice 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.820
 It also came out of the should 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.110
 originally already other 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.730
 character have something 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.490
 self-confident have a lot to do with it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 Sleepy but sleepy that fits 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.720
 even so I do not stand myself too 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 i became the role of the mobbing victim 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.250
 Although more or less forced 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.190
 but that makes it look even cuter 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.280
 In any case , we think we are coming to 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.900
 my last character as well should 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.660
 actually a main actor in one 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.430
 another animated project from scacchi 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.140
 but that is canceled 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.410
 and that's why tomorrow is never 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.720
 appeared as a guest at the kolorit as 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.010
 I found myself thinking why not the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.080
 just insert again 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.230
 because some of atari still remains at 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.540
 Life and chaotic are to the group 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.150
 not with insert synonymous because yes yes 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.720
 cake entertainment is one of those 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.850
 name of mori ruby ​​that's something 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.620
 quite different like scarves and shy 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.959
 that means that what but what is called 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.790
 At that time I had to be muri for atari 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 to come up with a Japanese name and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.920
 mori's name I like it too 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.590
 the thing moritz surnames one 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.600
 Japanese noble family the family 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.459
 So rather the clan is in the bag 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.470
 play shoes and jewelery and 2 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.280
 playable 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.290
 Funny enough, I'll have it later 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.660
 found out that the word muri too 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.940
 comes from the Latin and die 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.560
 means is so you can go after 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.740
 at least in the morning about the same 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.340
 represent the same 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.320
 Characteristics only with him 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.180
 the wings are never shown that 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.040
 someone thinks difficult and complicated 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.960
 stop only if he flies but gave so far 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.240
 There are no teeth for flying 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.520
 In addition, a difference has been 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.350
 sucking with red pupils and mori 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.600
 has just channel red eyes with with 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.740
 black popeln so that you stop 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.360
 can still distinguish 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.580
 also had me in total 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.010
 we thought we could stop 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.850
 be shit and the fabric has that too 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.520
 Mori had little before that 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 younger brother of thomas karschny 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.660
 suggested that maybe the two 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.300
 sometimes a picture could happen 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.850
 but it would be really official 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.540
 look stupid meant so two morys 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.609
 In any case, it was me 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.920
 hope you have not fallen asleep 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.050
 learn something and I hope so too 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.450

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.310
