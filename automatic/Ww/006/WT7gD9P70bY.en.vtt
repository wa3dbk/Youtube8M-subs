00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
snakes through the wreath I spent about

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.980 
snakes through the wreath I spent about
an<00:01:11.590> hour<00:01:11.679> placing<00:01:12.490> all<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.880> my<00:01:13.030> snakes<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.840> it's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
an hour placing all of my snakes so it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.050 
an hour placing all of my snakes so it's
a<00:01:14.020> little<00:01:14.229> time<00:01:14.560> consuming<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.580> it'll<00:01:15.940> look

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
a little time consuming but it'll look

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.419 
a little time consuming but it'll look
really<00:01:16.539> cool<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.289> end<00:01:17.320> if<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.130> need<00:01:18.280> to

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
really cool in the end if you need to

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.580 
really cool in the end if you need to
you<00:01:18.729> can<00:01:18.850> use<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.060> little<00:01:19.479> hot<00:01:19.720> glue<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.990> keep

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
you can use a little hot glue to keep

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.919 
you can use a little hot glue to keep
the<00:01:20.770> snakes<00:01:21.039> in<00:01:21.160> place<00:01:21.399> but<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.119> found<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.780> the

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
the snakes in place but I found that the

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.020 
the snakes in place but I found that the
hot<00:01:23.080> glue<00:01:23.289> didn't<00:01:23.710> actually<00:01:23.979> take<00:01:24.550> very<00:01:24.910> well

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
hot glue didn't actually take very well

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.450 
hot glue didn't actually take very well
to<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.570> rubber<00:01:25.720> snakes<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.679> I<00:01:26.710> would<00:01:27.160> use<00:01:27.310> it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
to the rubber snakes so I would use it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.190 
to the rubber snakes so I would use it
sparingly<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.270> mostly<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:28.869> trying<00:01:29.110> to

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
sparingly and mostly just trying to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.230 
sparingly and mostly just trying to
weave<00:01:29.380> them<00:01:29.619> through<00:01:30.220> enough<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.909> sticks

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
weave them through enough of the sticks

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.210 
weave them through enough of the sticks
in<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.600> wreath<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:32.079> they<00:01:32.229> stay<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.560> place<00:01:32.890> on

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
in the wreath that they stay in place on

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.340 
in the wreath that they stay in place on
their<00:01:33.460> own<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.119> once<00:01:34.329> you<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.689> bunch<00:01:35.140> of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
their own so once you have a bunch of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.770 
their own so once you have a bunch of
the<00:01:35.530> large<00:01:35.799> snakes<00:01:36.280> in<00:01:36.520> place<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.540> then

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the large snakes in place you can then

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.810 
the large snakes in place you can then
fill<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.229> some<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.740> gaps<00:01:38.890> with<00:01:39.340> smaller

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
fill in some of the gaps with smaller

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.030 
fill in some of the gaps with smaller
snakes<00:01:40.180> like<00:01:40.450> these<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.110> again<00:01:41.470> I'll<00:01:41.860> put<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
snakes like these and again I'll put a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.920 
snakes like these and again I'll put a
link<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:42.610> them<00:01:42.790> down<00:01:43.090> below<00:01:43.390> for<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
link to get them down below for the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.929 
link to get them down below for the
smaller<00:01:44.200> ones<00:01:44.439> especially<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.369> also<00:01:45.549> use

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
smaller ones especially you can also use

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.999 
smaller ones especially you can also use
some<00:01:46.149> needle<00:01:46.420> nose<00:01:46.450> pliers<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.079> help<00:01:47.500> grab<00:01:47.799> the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
some needle nose pliers to help grab the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.010 
some needle nose pliers to help grab the
snakes<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.640> weave<00:01:48.880> them<00:01:49.090> around<00:01:49.390> some<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.810> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
snakes and weave them around some of the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.080 
snakes and weave them around some of the
tighter<00:01:50.350> knit<00:01:50.649> sticks<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> wreath<00:01:51.700> so

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
tighter knit sticks in the wreath so

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.149 
tighter knit sticks in the wreath so
once<00:01:52.270> you're<00:01:52.420> happy<00:01:52.450> with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.200> snake<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.890> read

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
once you're happy with the snake to read

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.030 
looks really cool on its own however I
think<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.899> effect<00:02:02.140> would<00:02:02.350> be<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.530> little<00:02:02.890> more

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
think the effect would be a little more

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.730 
think the effect would be a little more
subtle<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.700> therefore<00:02:04.149> more<00:02:04.450> creepy<00:02:05.049> if<00:02:05.320> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
subtle and therefore more creepy if the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.340 
subtle and therefore more creepy if the
whole<00:02:05.920> thing<00:02:06.159> was<00:02:06.579> one<00:02:06.880> solid<00:02:07.240> color<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:08.320> I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
whole thing was one solid color so I

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.710 
whole thing was one solid color so I
brought<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.039> outside<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.789> spray<00:02:10.060> painted<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
brought it outside and spray painted the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.020 
brought it outside and spray painted the
entire<00:02:11.079> thing<00:02:11.560> gray<00:02:11.980> you're<00:02:12.579> going<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.850> want

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
entire thing gray you're going to want

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.699 
entire thing gray you're going to want
to<00:02:13.090> paint<00:02:13.360> from<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.750> bit<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.079> distance<00:02:14.470> so

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
to paint from a bit of a distance so

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.680 
to paint from a bit of a distance so
that<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:14.980> paint<00:02:15.220> doesn't<00:02:15.489> pull<00:02:15.910> up<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.420> drip

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that the paint doesn't pull up and drip

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.690 
that the paint doesn't pull up and drip
but<00:02:17.260> make<00:02:17.530> sure<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.799> get<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:18.220> every<00:02:18.579> angle

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
but make sure to get it from every angle

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
but make sure to get it from every angle
so<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.360> paint<00:02:19.600> gets<00:02:19.810> into<00:02:20.170> every<00:02:20.650> nook

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
so that the paint gets into every nook

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.830 
so that the paint gets into every nook
and<00:02:21.130> cranny<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.850> once<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> front<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.630> dry

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and cranny then once the front is dry

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.349 
and cranny then once the front is dry
turn<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.440> over<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.010> paint<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.519> back<00:02:24.700> let<00:02:25.209> that

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
turn it over and paint the back let that

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.360
