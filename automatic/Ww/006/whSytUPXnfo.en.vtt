chord comes along and make reference to
it<00:00:17.230> reference<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:17.980> F<00:00:18.250> I<00:00:18.550> begin<00:00:19.180> with<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.360> big

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
it reference to F I begin with a big

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.409 
it reference to F I begin with a big
oblique<00:00:20.290> been<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.369> I'm<00:00:24.460> bending<00:00:24.700> the<00:00:24.970> g<00:00:25.210> string

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
oblique been so I'm bending the g string

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.150 
oblique been so I'm bending the g string
but<00:00:25.899> I<00:00:25.930> have<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.169> pinky<00:00:26.470> bar<00:00:26.680> across<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.009> top

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
but I have the pinky bar across the top

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.620 
but I have the pinky bar across the top
two<00:00:27.640> at<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.509> 9th<00:00:28.750> fret<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.419> I'm<00:00:31.419> actually

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
two at the 9th fret and I'm actually

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.720 
two at the 9th fret and I'm actually
emulating<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.529> start<00:00:32.950> of<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.100> solo<00:00:33.399> that<00:00:33.610> you

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
emulating the start of the solo that you

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.790 
emulating the start of the solo that you
hear<00:00:34.000> on<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.480> black<00:00:34.719> crowes<00:00:34.960> version<00:00:35.469> of<00:00:35.620> this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
hear on the black crowes version of this

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:50.630 
hear on the black crowes version of this
song<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.030> begin<00:00:37.630> with<00:00:37.840> that<00:00:38.050> oblique<00:00:38.590> van

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.330 

that's<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.850> first<00:00:52.120> phrase

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750 

you<00:00:57.340> want<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.640> keep<00:00:57.790> that<00:00:57.850> g-string<00:00:58.360> been

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
you want to keep that g-string been

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.479 
you want to keep that g-string been
you

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.410 

yeah<00:01:04.489> that's<00:01:05.059> another<00:01:05.360> solid<00:01:05.720> melodic<00:01:06.410> idea

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.390 

and<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.870> could<00:01:12.020> use<00:01:12.200> hybrid<00:01:12.440> picking<00:01:15.340> using<00:01:16.340> a

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
and you could use hybrid picking using a

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.020 
and you could use hybrid picking using a
finger<00:01:16.700> pick<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.150> high<00:01:17.270> string<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.820> just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
finger pick on the high string we just

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.090 
finger pick on the high string we just
pick<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.270> conventionally<00:01:20.830> then<00:01:21.830> i'm<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.040> to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
pick it conventionally then i'm going to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.100 
pick it conventionally then i'm going to
use<00:01:22.340> another<00:01:22.790> oblique<00:01:23.390> been<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:29.390> again<00:01:29.630> b-flat

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
use another oblique been so again b-flat

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.520 
use another oblique been so again b-flat
minor<00:01:30.290> pentatonic<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.780> that's<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> sound<00:01:36.350> i

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
minor pentatonic and that's the sound i

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.010 
minor pentatonic and that's the sound i
like<00:01:36.740> where<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.040> play<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.400> minor<00:01:37.640> third<00:01:38.020> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
like where you play the minor third and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.480 
like where you play the minor third and
then<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.320> bend<00:01:39.560> into<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:45.190> little<00:01:46.190> little

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
then you bend into it a little little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.880 
then you bend into it a little little
brief<00:01:46.729> excursion<00:01:47.630> into<00:01:48.170> b<00:01:48.410> flat<00:01:48.560> major

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
brief excursion into b flat major

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.040 
brief excursion into b flat major
pentatonic<00:01:49.369> as<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> way<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.030> balance<00:01:50.330> against

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
pentatonic as a way to balance against

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:03.070 
pentatonic as a way to balance against
minor<00:01:51.259> pentatonic<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.660> then<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.470> here

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.399 

so<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.290> sound

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.330 

ah<00:02:07.469> i<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:08.970> flat<00:02:09.269> seven<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.869> flat<00:02:10.340> against

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
ah i have my flat seven a flat against

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.309 
ah i have my flat seven a flat against
my<00:02:11.459> b<00:02:11.670> flat<00:02:11.849> rude<00:02:12.180> nope<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:12.660> banding<00:02:13.110> up

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
my b flat rude nope and I'm banding up

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:24.250 
my b flat rude nope and I'm banding up
to<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> flat

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.130 

and<00:02:25.260> when<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> repeatedly<00:02:26.540> pick<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> G<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
and when I repeatedly pick the G to the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.440 
and when I repeatedly pick the G to the
B<00:02:28.410> string<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> been<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
B string with a been I like to do a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.010 
B string with a been I like to do a
thing<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> pig<00:02:38.240> what's<00:02:39.240> happening<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
thing with the pig what's happening is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.980 
thing with the pig what's happening is
I'm<00:02:40.500> using<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.010> Down<00:02:41.220> stroke<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:45.540> hit<00:02:45.720> both

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
I'm using a Down stroke to hit both

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.699 
I'm using a Down stroke to hit both
strings<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:48.840> i'm<00:02:48.990> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> drag<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
strings but then i'm going to drag it

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.210 
strings but then i'm going to drag it
back<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.010> hit<00:02:53.819> both<00:02:54.030> strings<00:02:54.360> again<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
back and hit both strings again so the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.190 
back and hit both strings again so the
picking<00:02:56.670> pattern<00:02:57.030> actually<00:02:57.180> sounds<00:02:57.810> totally

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
picking pattern actually sounds totally

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.910 
picking pattern actually sounds totally
weird<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.220> sounds<00:02:59.489> cool<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.769> hear

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
weird but it sounds cool you can hear

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920 
weird but it sounds cool you can hear
all<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.220> too<00:03:05.400> little<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.360> all<00:03:06.450> these<00:03:06.600> extra

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
all this too little it's all these extra

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.729 
all this too little it's all these extra
pics

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:31.190 

then<00:03:13.739> we<00:03:13.859> go<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> em<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.480> after<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> F<00:03:28.109> here<00:03:30.200> I'm

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
then we go to em so after the F here I'm

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.420 
then we go to em so after the F here I'm
gonna<00:03:31.319> do<00:03:31.530> another<00:03:31.799> fast<00:03:32.400> tremolo<00:03:33.180> picking

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.330 

bending<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.459> fourth<00:03:39.940> up<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.450> fifth<00:03:41.340> flat

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
bending the fourth up to the fifth flat

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.440 
bending the fourth up to the fifth flat
seven<00:03:42.760> there<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.580> example<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.180> don't

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
seven there but in this example I don't

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.940 
seven there but in this example I don't
move<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.750> g-string<00:03:52.349> some<00:03:53.349> tension<00:03:53.830> is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
move that g-string some tension is

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.530 
move that g-string some tension is
created<00:03:54.310> by<00:03:54.459> sitting<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.269> thing<00:03:55.510> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
created by sitting on that thing that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.289 
created by sitting on that thing that
