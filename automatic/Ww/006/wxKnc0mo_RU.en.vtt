interest me frankly the reason it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
interesting back here it's no longer

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
interesting back here it's no longer
interesting<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.469> move<00:00:46.800> has

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
interesting because that move has

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
interesting because that move has
already<00:00:47.309> run<00:00:48.030> its<00:00:48.239> course<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:49.079> really

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
already run its course I don't really

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
already run its course I don't really
care<00:00:49.649> about<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> care<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
care about that what I care about is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
care about that what I care about is
this<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.039> care<00:00:53.760> about<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.360> long<00:00:55.219> squeeze<00:00:56.219> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this I care about this long squeeze this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.630 
this I care about this long squeeze this
prolonged<00:00:57.360> squeeze<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.829> only<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> squeeze

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
prolonged squeeze not only the squeeze

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.080 
prolonged squeeze not only the squeeze
but<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.120> importantly<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.410> high-velocity

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
but more importantly the high-velocity

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
but more importantly the high-velocity
pop<00:01:03.260> now<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:05.540> think<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.720> tux<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.650> higher<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pop now I think this tux going higher I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
pop now I think this tux going higher I
think<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.290> has<00:01:10.500> some

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
think this is where this really has some

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.630 
think this is where this really has some
momentum<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> reason<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.640> am

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
momentum but the reason that I am

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.320 
momentum but the reason that I am
featuring<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.640> want

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
featuring this here is because I I want

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
featuring this here is because I I want
to<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> other<00:01:18.960> side<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:20.070> guys
