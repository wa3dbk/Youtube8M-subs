who's going to just give them the answer

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.810 
who's going to just give them the answer
now<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.380> approach<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.490> might<00:02:19.640> be

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
now this approach it and you might be

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.370 
now this approach it and you might be
you<00:02:20.240> might<00:02:20.270> be<00:02:20.540> doing<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:20.930> yourself<00:02:21.080> right

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
you might be doing this yourself right

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.680 
you might be doing this yourself right
now<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.640> which<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.000> kind<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.450> lame

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
now but this is which is kind of lame

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.950 
now but this is which is kind of lame
and<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.280> more<00:02:25.430> highly<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.180> than<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960
