00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.879 
nice little idea is the the second XLR
rather<00:02:59.660> than<00:02:59.780> both<00:02:59.959> being<00:03:00.230> front<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.709> at<00:03:00.829> the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
rather than both being front is at the

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.920 
rather than both being front is at the
back<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.310> camera<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.880> can<00:03:02.299> be<00:03:02.389> set<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.600> mic

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
back of the camera and can be set to mic

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.650 
back of the camera and can be set to mic
or<00:03:03.200> line<00:03:03.230> level<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.579> could<00:03:04.970> literally<00:03:05.359> be

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660
