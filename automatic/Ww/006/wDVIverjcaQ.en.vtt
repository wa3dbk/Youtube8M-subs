00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I'm going to go over operations first

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.099 
I'm going to go over operations first
and<00:00:13.380> yeah<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.429> see<00:00:14.820> right<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.780> i'm<00:00:15.960> on

and yeah you can see right there i'm on

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.960 
and yeah you can see right there i'm on
the<00:00:16.230> operation<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.010> operations<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> huge

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the operation and operations are a huge

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.920 
the operation and operations are a huge
part<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.560> bonus<00:00:19.920> XP<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:21.449> well<00:00:21.750> as

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
part because you get bonus XP as well as

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
part because you get bonus XP as well as
squad<00:00:22.289> points<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.490> also<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.910> bonus

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
squad points and then you also get bonus

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.589 
squad points and then you also get bonus
squad<00:00:24.539> points<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.140> bundle<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.830> together

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
squad points if you bundle them together

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.380 
squad points if you bundle them together
at<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> same<00:00:27.960> time<00:00:28.429> but<00:00:29.429> basically<00:00:30.150> they're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
at the same time but basically they're

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.799 
at the same time but basically they're
just<00:00:30.630> challenges<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.730> operations<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
just challenges and the operations you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
just challenges and the operations you
get<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.350> changed<00:00:35.309> automatically<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> believe

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
get are changed automatically I believe

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.810 
get are changed automatically I believe
every<00:00:37.020> 15<00:00:38.010> days<00:00:38.040> um<00:00:38.870> however<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:41.460> five

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
every 15 days um however if you get five

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.430 
every 15 days um however if you get five
I<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.450> recommend<00:00:42.980> getting<00:00:43.980> new<00:00:44.309> operations

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
I would recommend getting new operations

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.959 
I would recommend getting new operations
right<00:00:46.440> away<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.370> soon<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> get

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
right away because as soon as you get

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.170 
right away because as soon as you get
the<00:00:48.180> new<00:00:48.450> operations<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> bonus<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the new operations you get the bonus and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
the new operations you get the bonus and
then<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:52.020> keep<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then you can just keep going at it so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
then you can just keep going at it so
you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> five<00:00:54.180> completed<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you can see I have five completed in the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.819 
you can see I have five completed in the
bottom<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> new

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
bottom right so I'm going to get the new

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.040 
bottom right so I'm going to get the new
operations<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.789> cost<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.600> squad

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
operations and it does cost one squad

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.310 
operations and it does cost one squad
point<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> see<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.629> well<00:01:03.870> worth<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
point but you can see it's well worth it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
point but you can see it's well worth it
because<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> four<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> 4

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
because you get the four so I go up to 4

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
because you get the four so I go up to 4
immediately<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> start<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:09.270> does

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
immediately and I can start over it does

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
immediately and I can start over it does
change<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.590> operations<00:01:10.920> except<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
change all of the operations except the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.140 
change all of the operations except the
ones<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.450> showing<00:01:12.990> at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.619> front<00:01:14.150> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ones you have showing at the front so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
ones you have showing at the front so
keep<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> mind<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> keep

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
keep that in mind if you want to keep

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
keep that in mind if you want to keep
any<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> operations<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.570> see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
any of the operations like you can see

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
any of the operations like you can see
I'm<00:01:19.140> almost<00:01:19.530> completed<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> couple<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> them

so I'm going to keep them and then get
completely<00:01:23.070> new<00:01:23.369> ones<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> don't<00:01:25.140> like

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
completely new ones that I don't like

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.840 
completely new ones that I don't like
basically<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> next<00:01:28.259> tip<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
basically so on to the next tip I know a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
basically so on to the next tip I know a
lot<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> probably<00:01:31.049> want<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.040> do

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
lot of you probably want to know how do

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270 
lot of you probably want to know how do
you<00:01:32.430> whom<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.670> humiliate<00:01:33.570> someone<00:01:34.280> humiliate

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you whom you humiliate someone humiliate

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
you whom you humiliate someone humiliate
I<00:01:35.520> can't<00:01:35.909> talk<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.390> guess<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.200> don't<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.740> what

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I can't talk I guess I I don't know what

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
I can't talk I guess I I don't know what
that<00:01:37.979> problem<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that problem is but you can see the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100 
that problem is but you can see the
field<00:01:40.170> order<00:01:40.880> humiliate<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
field order humiliate is one that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.389 
field order humiliate is one that
probably<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.280> how<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
probably a lot of you don't know how to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
probably a lot of you don't know how to
get<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.299> guessing<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> most<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
get and I'm guessing that most of you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
get and I'm guessing that most of you
don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> do

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
don't know how to get it because I do

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
don't know how to get it because I do
know<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> get

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
know how to get it and the way you get

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.710 
know how to get it and the way you get
it<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> completely<00:01:52.439> ridiculous<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.570> don't<00:01:54.570> ask

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it is completely ridiculous I don't ask

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.350 
it is completely ridiculous I don't ask
me<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> figured<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:57.090> why<00:01:57.329> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
me how I figured this I don't know why I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.410 
me how I figured this I don't know why I
tried<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.310> guessing<00:02:00.030> how

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
tried this when I was just guessing how

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990 
tried this when I was just guessing how
to<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.759> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
to do it but the way to get it is you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
to do it but the way to get it is you
t-bag<00:02:03.390> someone<00:02:03.840> I'm<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.860> why

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
t-bag someone I'm I don't know why

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
t-bag someone I'm I don't know why
that's<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.630> humiliated

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that's it but that is how you humiliated

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.889 
that's it but that is how you humiliated
I<00:02:07.829> mean<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> obviously<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.810> I'm

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
I mean I obviously I know but I'm

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.070 
I mean I obviously I know but I'm
surprised<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.830> made<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:12.080> but

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
surprised that they made it that but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
surprised that they made it that but
nonetheless<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
nonetheless the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
nonetheless the
field<00:02:14.010> orders<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.580> incredibly<00:02:15.240> good<00:02:15.420> so

field orders are incredibly good so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.940
