00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.529
 looks so totally spinach I wet 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.750
 I did it with black tea 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.970
 because the color intensity then still 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:34.570
 better should steam still hot water 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:37.210
 Let's go and I will show you then 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.129
 equal to the result 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.489
 so now again totally stupid for 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.239
 you have to apply to after that way 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.649
 a hood on it somehow 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.489
 because of the heat so that better 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.399
 can develop 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.090
 I once living room taken from santa 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.489
 Hand and the order was not total 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.809
 pleasantly I have to say better sometimes 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.160
 a chemical thing and because of me 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.210
 also always annoying and totally annoying 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.500
 smell from it I have to stop 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.460
 but get used to how much more comfortable than 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.289
 really the chemical thing because of that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.240
 really sting your eyes 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.220
 out and also the smell is at all 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.270
 not nice 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.759
 So I found that much more enjoyable too 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.560
 Applying reminded me as 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.750
 I was at that time the woman karin hair 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.770
 have bleached and with such a powder 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.110
 but as I said it was all somehow 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.740
 pleasant and that's just warm 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.270
 but somehow always nice 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.709
 result I think and that is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.780
 he will not be so plump but he stands 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.149
 yes also in the description in it that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.080
 with each time where you really color 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.060
 that then 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.530
 the result also gets better 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.960
 also because i use chemical colors 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.210
 full worked fine 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.330
 let's wait and see, I 'll wash it out 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.800
 that two hours on it and then 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.800
 I look forward to the result 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.420
 Then the result is my hair 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 So that feels like they are still last 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.290
 that's why it's a bit weird now 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.400
 Yes, I am quite satisfied 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.740
 that somehow not exactly 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.260
 I should think so 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.940
 I 've already thought something like that 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.440
 the color is not really what will 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.350
 there is my I have just too 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.580
 broken 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.470
 I'm going to wait for it to dry completely 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.270
 But I have to be honest 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.610
 better has the match similar product 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:44.170
 Do not be mad because of that 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.610
 top just a bit falsified 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.630
 when i could later the result fell 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.630
 already see a little better 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.230
 So personally, I'm super better than 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 I'm going to be beautiful somehow - I can do that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.800
 I think I do not know if you 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.320
 Maybe you can give me some experience 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.660
 That's the first time I've done that 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.730
 have and how it has washed out that 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.489
 It took me all that long 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.370
 petty war him out wanting this 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.660
 powder stuff so maybe that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.510
 made a mistake somewhere and my hair 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.030
 to grow 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.410
 well now I leave it out first 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920
 the night because I will not anymore 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.590
 but so filled and then just look 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:36.730
 just how the whole looks but for 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.730
 natural products from
