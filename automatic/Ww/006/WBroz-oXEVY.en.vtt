00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
integrate it into the full I 1000 app so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.999

so<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.420> final<00:02:33.630> result<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> simple<00:02:34.710> app<00:02:34.860> that

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
so the final result is a simple app that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.430 
so the final result is a simple app that
can<00:02:35.190> connect<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> sky<00:02:36.120> radar<00:02:36.450> unit<00:02:36.780> parse

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
can connect to the sky radar unit parse

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.520 
can connect to the sky radar unit parse

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the adsb messages from it and log all

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.840 
the adsb messages from it and log all

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
testing at the bench in the simulator
looks<00:02:46.709> good<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> app<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.760> installed<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.270> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
looks good so the app is installed on a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720 
looks good so the app is installed on a
test<00:02:48.570> iPad<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.260> quick<00:02:49.920> confirmation<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.610> the

test iPad a quick confirmation that the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
test iPad a quick confirmation that the
app<00:02:50.850> works<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.690> ipad<00:02:52.050> confirms<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.709> we
