00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
this had become very bumpy and it's a

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.860 
this had become very bumpy and it's a
case<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.470> trying<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.430> go<00:04:23.580> through<00:04:23.760> here<00:04:23.970> flat<00:04:24.240> I

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
think you only can do every second

think you only can do every second
