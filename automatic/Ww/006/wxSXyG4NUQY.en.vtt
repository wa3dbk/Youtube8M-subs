00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
places pretty expensive for what it is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.380 
places pretty expensive for what it is
it's<00:00:28.490> just<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.850> two-channel<00:00:30.190> helicopter<00:00:31.390> very

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
it's just a two-channel helicopter very

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.510 
it's just a two-channel helicopter very
small<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.500> actually<00:00:33.710> labeled<00:00:34.340> as<00:00:34.489> the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
small it's actually labeled as the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.110 
small it's actually labeled as the
world's<00:00:35.120> smallest<00:00:35.480> flying<00:00:36.110> TARDIS<00:00:36.940> which<00:00:37.940> as

world's smallest flying TARDIS which as

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.990 
world's smallest flying TARDIS which as
far<00:00:38.360> as<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.629> know<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.500> only<00:00:39.770> RC<00:00:40.489> TARDIS

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
far as I know this is the only RC TARDIS

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.360 
far as I know this is the only RC TARDIS
other<00:00:41.270> than<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.960> custom<00:00:42.530> one<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.950> somebody

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
other than a custom one that somebody

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.180 
other than a custom one that somebody
made<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:44.170> think<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.530> only<00:00:45.710> production

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
made I think this is the only production

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.030 
made I think this is the only production
RC<00:00:46.940> TARDIS<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.390> can<00:00:47.660> get<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.890> is

it's<00:00:55.730> kind<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.059> interesting<00:00:56.630> you<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:56.809> got

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's kind of interesting you just got

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.370 
it's kind of interesting you just got
your<00:00:57.410> throttle<00:00:57.950> here<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.430> center<00:00:58.910> and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
your throttle here in the center and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.470 
your throttle here in the center and
then<00:01:00.380> all<00:01:00.649> these<00:01:00.860> buttons<00:01:01.399> are<00:01:01.730> your<00:01:01.969> left<00:01:02.270> and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
then all these buttons are your left and

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.459 
then all these buttons are your left and
right<00:01:02.690> turn

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
right turn

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.130 
right turn
basically<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.670> you've<00:01:04.850> got<00:01:05.119> everywhere<00:01:05.750> from

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
basically so you've got everywhere from

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.630 
basically so you've got everywhere from
fast<00:01:07.070> normal<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.180> slow<00:01:08.659> left<00:01:09.649> turn<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.430> then

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
fast normal and slow left turn and then

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.510 
fast normal and slow left turn and then
again<00:01:10.909> on<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.420> turn<00:01:11.889> so<00:01:12.889> you<00:01:12.979> can<00:01:13.219> you

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
again on the right turn so you can you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.859 
again on the right turn so you can you
can<00:01:13.700> kind<00:01:13.969> of<00:01:14.139> change<00:01:15.139> how<00:01:15.560> fast<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.999> you<00:01:17.450> you

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
can kind of change how fast you you you

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.199 
can kind of change how fast you you you
know<00:01:18.020> how<00:01:18.229> fast<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.859> it<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.369> either<00:01:19.549> spinning

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
know how fast it it is either spinning

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.629 
know how fast it it is either spinning
in<00:01:20.479> one<00:01:21.170> direction<00:01:21.409> or<00:01:21.829> not<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.219> you<00:01:22.249> can<00:01:22.459> use

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:22.639 
in one direction or not so you can use

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.669 
in one direction or not so you can use
those<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.090> kind<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.389> try<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.659> level<00:01:24.079> it<00:01:24.229> out<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
those to kind of try to level it out and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.289 
those to kind of try to level it out and
keep<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.159> steady<00:01:25.399> or<00:01:25.700> if<00:01:25.819> you<00:01:25.939> want<00:01:26.209> it

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
keep it steady or if you want it

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.629 
keep it steady or if you want it
spinning<00:01:26.659> really<00:01:26.929> fast<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.529> can<00:01:27.679> do<00:01:27.829> that<00:01:28.039> too

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
spinning really fast you can do that too

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.149 
spinning really fast you can do that too
I<00:01:28.719> found<00:01:29.719> that<00:01:29.899> it<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.380> pretty<00:01:30.679> hard<00:01:31.009> to

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
I found that it is pretty hard to

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.129 
I found that it is pretty hard to
actually<00:01:31.609> tell<00:01:31.909> which<00:01:32.179> way<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:32.630> spinning

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:33.139 
actually tell which way it's spinning

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.440 
actually tell which way it's spinning
when<00:01:33.380> when<00:01:34.159> it's<00:01:34.279> in<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.549> air<00:01:34.579> it's<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.329> know

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
when when it's in the air it's you know

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.480 
when when it's in the air it's you know
it's<00:01:35.569> moving<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.170> fast<00:01:36.439> it's<00:01:36.799> kind<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.099> hard<00:01:37.310> to

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
it's moving so fast it's kind of hard to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.879 
it's moving so fast it's kind of hard to
even<00:01:37.670> tell<00:01:37.999> if<00:01:38.359> it's<00:01:38.959> going<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.469> left<00:01:39.709> or

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
even tell if it's going to the left or

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:45.039 
even tell if it's going to the left or
the<00:01:39.979> right<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:41.689> it<00:01:42.200> does<00:01:42.439> it's<00:01:42.889> really<00:01:44.049> really

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
the right and it does it's really really

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.260 
the right and it does it's really really
wobbly<00:01:45.349> like<00:01:45.859> there's<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.130> huge<00:01:46.520> toilet<00:01:47.119> bowl

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
wobbly like there's a huge toilet bowl

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.660 
wobbly like there's a huge toilet bowl
effect<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.560> once<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.920> gets<00:01:49.069> flying<00:01:49.429> it

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
effect so like once it gets flying it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.659 
effect so like once it gets flying it
kind<00:01:49.969> of<00:01:50.119> gets<00:01:50.929> doing<00:01:51.439> like<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:51.889> it<00:01:52.219> doesn't

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:52.669 
kind of gets doing like this it doesn't

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:56.319 
kind of gets doing like this it doesn't
stay<00:01:53.090> nice<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.509> level<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.319> it<00:01:54.679> does<00:01:55.310> big<00:01:55.700> huge

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
stay nice and level it it does big huge

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.319 
stay nice and level it it does big huge
loops<00:01:56.749> and<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.829> only<00:01:57.950> flies<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:58.759> about<00:01:58.969> two

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
loops and it only flies for about two

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.870 
loops and it only flies for about two
minutes<00:01:59.569> but<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.380> charges<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.189> like<00:02:01.369> seven

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
minutes but it charges in like seven

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.719 
minutes but it charges in like seven
minutes<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.619> pretty<00:02:03.619> quick<00:02:03.919> fix<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.579> know

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
minutes so pretty quick fix you know

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.599 
minutes so pretty quick fix you know
quick<00:02:05.029> charge<00:02:05.389> quick<00:02:05.749> flight<00:02:06.159> but<00:02:07.159> again<00:02:07.459> you

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
quick charge quick flight but again you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.520 
quick charge quick flight but again you
know<00:02:07.729> pretty<00:02:07.969> expensive<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.229> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
know pretty expensive for what it is so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.410 
know pretty expensive for what it is so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
know a basic RC heli fan isn't going to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.400 
know a basic RC heli fan isn't going to
get<00:02:17.990> much<00:02:18.230> excitement<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.100> this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
get much excitement out of this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.870 
get much excitement out of this
but<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.590> pretty<00:02:20.830> cool<00:02:21.040> how<00:02:21.250> small<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.790> is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
but it is pretty cool how small it is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.900 
but it is pretty cool how small it is
here<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.840> silver<00:02:23.590> nano<00:02:24.130> Falcon<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
here is the silver nano Falcon the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.750 
here is the silver nano Falcon the
world's<00:02:25.300> smallest<00:02:25.540> RC<00:02:26.319> helicopter<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
world's smallest RC helicopter so you

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.580 
world's smallest RC helicopter so you
can<00:02:27.940> kind<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.270> get<00:02:28.420> an<00:02:28.540> idea<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.170> how

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
can kind of get an idea of just how

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.280 
can kind of get an idea of just how
small<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.400> mean<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.540> rotor<00:02:31.810> blades

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
small it is I mean the the rotor blades

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.130 
small it is I mean the the rotor blades
are<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.069> little<00:02:33.310> bit<00:02:33.520> bigger<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
are just a little bit bigger and the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.860 
are just a little bit bigger and the
body<00:02:35.380> overall<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.310> about<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.760> same<00:02:37.000> size<00:02:37.330> so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
body overall is about the same size so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.840 
body overall is about the same size so
pretty<00:02:38.590> cool<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.890> was<00:02:39.160> thinking<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.640> was<00:02:39.730> going

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
pretty cool I was thinking it was going

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.670 
pretty cool I was thinking it was going
to<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.330> five<00:02:40.600> or<00:02:40.810> six<00:02:41.050> inches<00:02:41.230> tall<00:02:41.650> so

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
to be like five or six inches tall so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.520 
to be like five or six inches tall so
when<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.370> saw<00:02:42.850> how<00:02:43.090> small<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.720> was<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.110> was<00:02:44.230> pretty

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
when I saw how small it was I was pretty

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.280 
when I saw how small it was I was pretty
shocked<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.239> kind<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.750> liked<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.260> way

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
shocked but I kind of liked it that way

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.080 
shocked but I kind of liked it that way
it<00:02:47.920> makes<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.640> more<00:02:48.880> unique<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.910> I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it makes it a little more unique and I

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.460 
it makes it a little more unique and I
really<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.360> think<00:02:52.600> that's<00:02:52.780> about<00:02:53.020> all<00:02:53.080> there<00:02:53.350> is

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
really I think that's about all there is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.470 
really I think that's about all there is
to<00:02:53.650> say<00:02:53.890> about<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.370> let's<00:02:54.820> go<00:02:55.000> see<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.360> in

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to say about it so let's go see it in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.560 
to say about it so let's go see it in
flight<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:57.670> right<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> flight

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
flight all right this is the flight

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.840

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.420 
review of the Doctor Who TARDIS copter
I'm<00:03:01.450> going<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.019> fly<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.290> for<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> entire

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
I'm going to fly it for the entire

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.160 
I'm going to fly it for the entire
duration<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.239> battery<00:03:04.570> which<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.930> only<00:03:05.080> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
duration of the battery which is only a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.560 
duration of the battery which is only a
couple<00:03:05.230> minutes<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:05.940> don't<00:03:06.940> blink<00:03:07.300> or<00:03:07.540> you'll

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
couple minutes so don't blink or you'll

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.830 
couple minutes so don't blink or you'll
miss<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:08.459> hopefully<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.850> keep<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.420> somewhat

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
miss it hopefully I can keep it somewhat

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.500 
miss it hopefully I can keep it somewhat
under<00:03:11.110> control<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.950> thing<00:03:12.239> wobbles<00:03:13.239> like

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
under control this thing wobbles like

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.590 
under control this thing wobbles like
crazy<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:15.000> something<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.060> forgot<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.330> mention

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
crazy and something I forgot to mention

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.250 
crazy and something I forgot to mention
is<00:03:16.900> when<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.200> turn<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:17.890> there's<00:03:18.610> no

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is when you turn this on there's no

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.690 
is when you turn this on there's no
power<00:03:20.260> indicator<00:03:20.739> there's<00:03:21.220> no<00:03:21.400> light

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
power indicator there's no light

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960 
power indicator there's no light
whatsoever<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.799> little<00:03:23.920> hard<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.790> tell

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
whatsoever so it's a little hard to tell

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.590 
whatsoever so it's a little hard to tell
if<00:03:25.150> you've<00:03:25.299> actually<00:03:25.480> got<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.110> or<00:03:26.410> not

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
if you've actually got it on or not

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.560 
if you've actually got it on or not
alright<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.739> we'll<00:03:30.610> give<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.970> go<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.360> see

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
alright so we'll give it a go and see

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.820 
alright so we'll give it a go and see
what<00:03:31.690> happens

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.230 

Oh<00:03:38.390> see<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.690> goes<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.140> gets<00:03:40.260> doing<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.740> big

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
Oh see there it goes it gets doing a big

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.270 
Oh see there it goes it gets doing a big
these<00:03:42.240> big<00:03:42.540> loops<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.350> no<00:03:43.560> idea<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.100> way

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
these big loops I have no idea which way

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120 
these big loops I have no idea which way
it's<00:03:44.460> spinning<00:03:44.850> right<00:03:45.030> now<00:03:45.290> it's<00:03:46.290> impossible

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's spinning right now it's impossible

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.810 
it's spinning right now it's impossible
to<00:03:47.250> tell

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
to tell

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.260 
to tell
I<00:03:49.130> think<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.310> spinning<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:51.410> and

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
I think it's spinning to the right and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.970 
I think it's spinning to the right and
sometimes<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.690> can<00:03:54.870> kind<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.350> knock<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.830> out

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
sometimes you can kind of knock it out

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.750 
sometimes you can kind of knock it out
of<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:57.180> cyclone<00:03:58.020> effect<00:03:58.530> by<00:03:59.430> like

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
of that that cyclone effect by like

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.520 
of that that cyclone effect by like
kicking<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.750> throttle<00:04:01.620> up<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.010> down<00:04:02.250> up<00:04:03.530> but

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
kicking the throttle up and down up but

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490 
kicking the throttle up and down up but
it<00:04:04.710> can<00:04:04.890> get<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.610> get<00:04:05.760> really<00:04:06.170> just<00:04:07.170> doing

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
it can get you can get really just doing

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.130 
it can get you can get really just doing
these<00:04:07.650> huge<00:04:08.630> tornado<00:04:09.630> loops<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:11.959> don't<00:04:12.959> know<00:04:13.050> if

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
these huge tornado loops I don't know if

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:22.090 
these huge tornado loops I don't know if
that's<00:04:13.320> intended<00:04:13.800> or<00:04:14.190> what

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100
