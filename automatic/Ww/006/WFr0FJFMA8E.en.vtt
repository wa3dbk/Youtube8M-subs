 tell me about the setup of my last 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 video that many of you tell me that now that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.000
 how I spent so much money on 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.160
 on a computer that goes computer cloth 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 that as good as I have to say that 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.200
 I have long been working to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.870
 everything what I have cost me 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.790
 what's mine get it out there they tell me 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.470
 also good to spend 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.750
 you both have a computer if you can 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.280
 spend on other things that's true the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 truth is that for me for example traveling 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.300
 love there are a lot of things that I 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 I like to do but I like to spend 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.800
 money on things that I like 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 then the computer that I bought it 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.490
 last year it was a whim a 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.400
 whim that I wanted to give myself because in that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 moment I could and why because he gave me the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.459
 basically wins and but that does not mean that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.160
 I like to spend money too 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.480
 in other things then more so that more 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.250
 for me for leisure for such I am 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.440
 I am always being very consistent 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.400
 with myself and leaving money for 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 some things and for others 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.010
 I wanted to tell you guys that I want me to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.980

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.260
 way to play the atlas although I know that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.250

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.010
 pending collaborations to be made with 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.930

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.260
 that I'm already installed I'm calm and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.030
 without any pressure for any 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.519
 side that I've had a year that has been 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
 a total madness guys are not there 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.690
 many things that I would love to tell you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.060
 but it does not work either because like I said in 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.220
 another video this is not pink sauce but 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.670
 but it's been crazy for the year and 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.030
 now since I'm focused and I enjoy 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.680
 so much with this from youtube that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.949
 I wanted to devote a lot to him 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 time it deserves is worth it and then I'm going 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.150
 to try to have a video every day or 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.460
 there will be the best every two days 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.470
 some time in which for two or 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.229
 three days I can not because I 'm out or 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.540
 is in something but right now today 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.510
 for today what I propose is that 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.840
 there is a video almost every day in the 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.140
 channel is worth I know it 's a very 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.060
 unstable I apologize a thousand thanks 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.200
 to those who are there, always what happens 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.850
 pass, you know who you are and good 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.640
 guys I'm super happy and with a 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.130
 lots of desire another little thing guys 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.080
 you tell me what video console I'm going to 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.820
 buy the new generation but as 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.400
 Liar asks if you know that I am from 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.710
 playstation network and I'm from playstation 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.130
 death then and what I have 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.740
 thought to have like almost all I think 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.840
 I always finish both 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.330
 video game consoles but but initially 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.400
 I wanted to buy the playstation 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.009
 I will end up buying xbox then 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.439
 surely 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.210
 surely because that's what happened to me 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.830
 the previous ones that I bought the 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.369
 playstation 3 and then finish buying 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.259
 I'm the xbox so I guess I'll do something 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.849
 well but with time and when I save 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.979
 for the second one because now I'm with 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.399
 a leaf of nesquik that you know that 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.830
 My purchase already bought me a boat of 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:40.749
 nesquik and I did a hairline already when 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.659
 I finished it and I'm going to throw the coins 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.979
 so for everything I have left over if 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.599
 loose to buy me the 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.759
 playstation and that the name of the both 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.600
 drop this pasture and all the 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.970
 games that entails clear 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.730
 so nothing I really want too 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.410
 that the new pro has arrived 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:03.530
 total hippie catering and that we can 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.950
 start having new new material 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.310
 games that's something that we're going right now 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.420
 It has me crazy and nothing guys tell you 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.420
 also that you are there is very important 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.729
 for me I think that youtube is 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.509
 going for the 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.309
 mountains of Ubeda as they say there and that 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.099
 I believe that the quality of the videos 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:30.110
 quality of the youtubers the quality of 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.909
 everything that is done is very important and 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.860
 sometimes we do not give it with the value that is 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.879
 it deserves so nothing to those that you want 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.930
 congratulations because that means that 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:44.330
 you are very smart and good a little 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.969
 more guys pp shots that I want that 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.839
 tell me what you want to see 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:52.549
 I do not know how to tell me little things so that I 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.679
 apart from the ideas that I have that I to 

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:59.239
 me is that I am very bighead and I say 

00:06:54.679 --> 00:07:00.679
 this and what is the head called but I 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:02.869
 I really like you to give me your 

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:04.489
 opinions because I can make a 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.529
 mix what you like to you and 

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:09.669
 of what I like to me at the same time 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:12.829
 so then we do there is a kind of 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:16.759

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:19.939
