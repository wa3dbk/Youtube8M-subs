 in Japan is something that sells there in the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.730
 Peruvians are the sixth community 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 foreigners are here working here in 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.690

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.570
 Brazilian would be the seven managers here 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.750
 has been here're the only glue and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 English 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.559

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 coca cola who will face so I 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 Inca kola captured by coca cola coca 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.100
 Script cola send a hug to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 all the Peruvians who watch our 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.129
 channel is also experiencing things of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210
 you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.150
 I told you how yellow I like to leave 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.150
 It's good, let's not ruin it. 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.250
 It tastes like nothing you know. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 You know you're remembering from here, you know. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.610
 when I was a child I had to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.240
 that the little ones I saw on the packaging 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.940
 with revolver in a kind a cart knows 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.060
 those weird colors but here 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.280
 never imagined now serious 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.080
 I do not know what it is who was Peruvian and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.530
 watching channel 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.570
 if you want to give an explanation of what 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.399
 that this copy of what it is to be tolerant 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.030
 leaves here below the destruction of this 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.479
 video ok we respect that here the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.340
 English fanta cola but what has flavor 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.970
 different from here 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.970
 OK 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.250
 before something gives you seems to remember 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.250
 currant 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.910
 but I think the cruise is because 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.040
 Speak nothing than these things here 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.200
 and once again I have some 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.010
 Peruvian watching me fail what is to be 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:03.130
 before you know you have to remind me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.130
 very brazilian with gas is a fan 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.650
 so here it is a little hotter than 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.540
 that other side the fall that does not have the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.510
 Definite taste for me, that already 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.790
 reminds us a little more about Brasilia and 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.380
 curiosities for you to leave Brazil 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 as it has a very large number of 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.980
 Peruvians here find these people in the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.410
 Brazilian market, we find 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.200
 quite a thing the Peruvian also finds 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.989
 A lot of philippines, too. 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.170
 in addition to those of the same imported 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.480

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.820
 and products that we can buy and a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
 affordable as well do not want to 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.500
 people can buy here from a 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.510
 Easiest way for sure in Brazil 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.250
 that an imported thing should be the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.690
 face eyes and it is 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.390
