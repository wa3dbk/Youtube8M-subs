00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
will be the back and then the I cut it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.350

so it'll be a cushion seat and then I'll

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.980 
so it'll be a cushion seat and then I'll
make<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.230> armrest<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.860> sit<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.100> there<00:02:18.990> and

seat<00:02:57.280> base<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.920> I'll<00:03:00.510> make<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
seat base and then I'll make the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.840 
seat base and then I'll make the
armrests<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.350> go<00:03:02.500> across<00:03:03.280> there<00:03:03.820> and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
armrests that go across there and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.570 
armrests that go across there and
they'll<00:03:04.090> sit<00:03:04.300> on<00:03:04.480> top<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.530> come<00:03:06.400> off

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
they'll sit on top of that and come off

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.979 
they'll sit on top of that and come off
the<00:03:06.760> outside<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:07.510> I'll<00:03:07.600> cut<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> little

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the outside of that so I'll cut a little

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.560 
the outside of that so I'll cut a little
groove<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.700> sits<00:03:09.910> there<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.330> that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
groove in it so it sits there like that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.979 
groove in it so it sits there like that
and<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:12.100> gonna<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:12.430> two<00:03:12.820> braces<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.870> go

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and I'm gonna make two braces that go

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.270 
and I'm gonna make two braces that go
across<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:16.440> another<00:03:17.440> piece<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.980> to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
across here and another piece of this to

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.020 
across here and another piece of this to
go<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.610> middle

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
go in the middle

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.380 
go in the middle
that'll<00:03:19.780> cover<00:03:19.959> with<00:03:20.340> material<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.430> foam<00:03:21.580> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
that'll cover with material and foam the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.710 
that'll cover with material and foam the
backrest<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.720> chance<00:03:27.720> okay

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
backrest and then it's a chance okay

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.979 
backrest and then it's a chance okay
there's<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.320> first<00:03:29.500> one<00:03:29.739> done<00:03:30.480> two<00:03:31.480> pieces

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
there's the first one done two pieces

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.050 
there's the first one done two pieces
for<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> back<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:33.130> cut<00:03:33.340> them<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.519> an<00:03:33.640> angle<00:03:33.730> so

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
for the back I cut them on an angle so

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.300 
for the back I cut them on an angle so
they<00:03:34.150> fit<00:03:34.360> inside<00:03:34.510> there<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:35.799> since<00:03:36.220> we

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
they fit inside there because since we

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.259 
they fit inside there because since we
cut<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.610> back<00:03:36.810> 16<00:03:37.810> in<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.250> front<00:03:39.610> oh<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.709> 20

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
cut the back 16 in the front oh the 20

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.050 
cut the back 16 in the front oh the 20
these<00:03:43.269> are<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.570> slight<00:03:43.870> angle<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.910> guy

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
these are on a slight angle so that guy

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.350 
these are on a slight angle so that guy
cut<00:03:46.269> an<00:03:46.360> angle<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> armrests

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
cut an angle in that and the armrests

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.520 
cut an angle in that and the armrests
are<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:50.910> cut<00:03:51.910> them<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.269> they<00:03:52.420> fit<00:03:53.260> their

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
are on I cut them so they fit their

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.400 
are on I cut them so they fit their
rounded<00:03:56.530> off<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.920> edges<00:03:58.079> rounded<00:03:59.079> off<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
rounded off the edges rounded off the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.830 
rounded off the edges rounded off the
top<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.579> off<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.090> back

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.400 

and<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:05.040> how<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.280> make<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> chair<00:04:07.400> awesome
