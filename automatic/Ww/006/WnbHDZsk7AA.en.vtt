00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.990
 Hello everyone 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 today let's see how to make 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.660
 Padded cottages like these are 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.550
 perfect as thoughts in Christmas and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 can be used both as 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 decoration for the tree simply 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.290
 thus leaving the cottage or 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 inserting a ring for the keys 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.899
 they can become beautiful 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 carry them out is very simple 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 and they only need waste from the gods 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 some small fabric inspections 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 the scrap of felt of the buttons is the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 it's done 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.559
 but let's see immediately how to make them 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.520
 we take two cuttings of cloth and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.520
 let's go and draw our silhouette 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 cut out 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.820
 and we use this piece we have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 clipped to create the other on 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.380
 second shape we need 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:56.240
 and here are the two pieces then we take a 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:01.159
 piece of decorative ribbon that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 we close it is in a trap I call in the middle 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.830
 so let 's put the fabric in from the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.410
 straight the ribbon that will then be turned 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.459
 in this way but to do so must 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.069
 being turned inwards is the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.069
 second piece on the right side to close 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.709
 now our house is ready for 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.269
 be sewn with the sewing machine 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.330
 we take our little house and go to 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.519
 sew the two sides the base la 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.380
 we leave open because from this da 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.950
 this part will be inserted 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.950
 the padding 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.690
 after sewing the entire side edge 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.690
 we turn the fabric from the right side 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.040
 we insert some wadding to stuff 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.040
 the cottage 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.030
 fold the fabric inside 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.220
 let's close the puzzle with a hidden point 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.390
 so let's take our needle do 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.390
 a knot at the end 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.789
 now the base of the cottage is well 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.280
 closed 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.680
 we can decorate the front of the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.780
 house using cut-outs of 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.780
 felt and some small buttons 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.320
 chase 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.879
 and finally we also sew the roof 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.580
 and the cottage is ready I hope you like them 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.090
 my houses to see you soon 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.090
 bye Bye
