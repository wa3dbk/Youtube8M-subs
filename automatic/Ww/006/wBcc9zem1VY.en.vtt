00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.910
 here we are in a new video and 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.080
 we're in the real empire clan butt the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.050
 best clan of the savior 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.329
 and well, many thanks to the beautiful 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
 which is what I have been able to donate the 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.560
 dragon that comes for it comes for 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.329
 ask for a level 5 dragon and what good 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.770
 I have a desire to try it and on top of that 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.899
 City Hall- 8 but a desire 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.820
 incredible a greeting for the beautiful of 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.590
 true that he is a great person and a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.340
 I greet the dimmer who has also 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.550
 asked for a greeting okay then it came in 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.200
 the camp 10 dragons and then in the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.020
 clan castle as not a dragon of the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 level 5 and it's the good giant we 're going to 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.980
 to leave there and of spells because it arrived 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.750
 that is being 2 rabies and one 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.640
 debugging of new guys still not 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.309
 I have nothing I do not have, they do not give me the gems 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.030
 so well there's no money to 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.039
 buy it is worth it that way of course 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.780
 let's stop attacking and let's try 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.549
 find a town hall 8 to the maximum 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.619
 it will surely cost me a lot 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.080
 find it so I'm going to paste a cut 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.090
 right here and now we found a 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.530
 town hall and I want to tell you that I've 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.690
 changed the army is not that there 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.340
 changed is that this is the second 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.290
 attack with dragon level 5 that I do the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 first, well, the recording came out 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.240
 bad and well then I threw the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920
 army again and well let's attack 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 I have also changed a bit the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.750
 army and as you can see is a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.780
 City Hall 8 to the maximum that ended 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 just to go up to 9 then we go 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.149
 to attack him in this area here is worth 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.390
 in this area and let's see how 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.390
 we make 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.210
 I'm not looking 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.299
 I believe that 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.770
 is that the village is like a diamond and if 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.920
 the dragons are going to spin 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.810
 then I think that if I take leave the king 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 here 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 a dragon around here I think it's going to be 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.210
 good 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.860
 every time I pulse for example 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.800
 it sounds a sound and well the truth I do not know 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.470
 what do you think your friends did not finish 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.910
 to convince the sound but well let's go 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.770
 Let's see 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 we have cleaned that area quite well 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.310
 then we 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.050
 and others by default 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.970
 pretty well they 're going to go all the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.520
 dragons to where I want now I'm going to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.490
 drop the eight balloons I will drop 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.860
 now what I feel 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.170
 level six and the dragon level 5 incredible 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 there's going to be a rage for 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.130
 here I hope you do not look good 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.340
 although it looks like they're going 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.590
 to deflect though the dragon level 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.420
 5 and you put an evans and the truth we are going to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.830
 put a cure here perfect the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.970
 dragon level 5 is mitigated from the center 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.630
 let's see if you can break the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.120
 town hall and let's see it does not take 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 a lot and break the buildings look how 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.020
 you can see that tower of arks will make them 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.510
 charge in a moment has already broken the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.549
 incredible town hall the truth 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.010
 and well, I do not know if a hundred drops here 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.319
 Per hundred I know honestly but what 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.379
 I do know that there are a lot of balloons and 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.659
 enough dragons around the corners and the 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.280
 Dragon Level 5 will die and within 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.040
 little let's look a little more at him 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.950
 has three pretty incredible horns the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.599
 truth and look what it holds is that I 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.120
 I think that ultimately it will take a lot 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.860
 and I do not know if I left it but the fire of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.230
 let's talk dragons net over him 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.650
 in tomorrow's video tomorrow I do not know if the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.170
 Friday I do not think you can not talk is 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.680
 about the fire of the dragons 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.340
 because there is a curiosity in them 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.409
 that good 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.769
 few people will know it's worth then 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.409
 let's see perfect I think we're going to 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.659
 do one hundred percent yes and good me 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.260

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.299
 leave 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.860
 the fire that they are throwing and good we go 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.099
 to speak tomorrow about them more thoroughly 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.750
 and you are going to find out some things that 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.760
 well few people knew it or some 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.890
 people did notice others no no 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.260

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.390

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.920
 we will leave it there and nothing 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.870
