9i<00:00:33.120> squared<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.100> learned<00:00:35.490> from<00:00:35.700> previous

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
9i squared but we learned from previous

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
9i squared but we learned from previous
courses<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.870> i<00:00:37.020> squared<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.740> negative<00:00:37.830> 1<00:00:39.230> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
courses in i squared and negative 1 so

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
courses in i squared and negative 1 so
that<00:00:40.440> means<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.830> is<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.870> 3i<00:00:42.870> minus<00:00:43.260> 9<00:00:44.360> two

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that means this is really 3i minus 9 two

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
that means this is really 3i minus 9 two

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so we get to hear we got one more fun

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.050 
so we get to hear we got one more fun
thank<00:02:59.070> goodness<00:02:59.280> we're<00:02:59.670> down<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.940> the<00:02:59.970> last

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
thank goodness we're down to the last

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.790 
thank goodness we're down to the last
one<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> last<00:03:01.380> time<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.709> go<00:03:01.770> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
one so this is the last time we go to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.449 
one so this is the last time we go to
multiply<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> now<00:03:04.920> we're<00:03:05.130> at<00:03:05.250> 1<00:03:06.090> plus<00:03:06.420> 3i

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
multiply this so now we're at 1 plus 3i

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.130 
multiply this so now we're at 1 plus 3i
times<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:09.269> negative<00:03:09.690> 6<00:03:10.200> 52<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.360> again<00:03:12.780> that's

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
times it's negative 6 52 so again that's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
times it's negative 6 52 so again that's
negative<00:03:13.799> 6i<00:03:14.959> there's<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:17.630> there's<00:03:18.630> negative

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
negative 6i there's two there's negative

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:29.790 
negative 6i there's two there's negative
18i<00:03:20.160> squared<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:25.250> 6i

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
something later that says the complex

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.710 
something later that says the complex
solutions<00:04:17.989> always<00:04:18.320> come<00:04:18.530> in<00:04:18.560> pairs<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.540> I

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
solutions always come in pairs and I

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.330 
solutions always come in pairs and I
says<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.440> know<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.859> one<00:04:22.070> plus

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
says that that I know that one plus

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.690 
says that that I know that one plus
three<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.700> an<00:04:23.120> answer<00:04:23.419> than<00:04:24.280> 1-3<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> would<00:04:25.580> also

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
three is an answer than 1-3 I would also

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.250 
three is an answer than 1-3 I would also
be<00:04:25.970> an<00:04:26.060> answer<00:04:27.070> but<00:04:28.070> that's<00:04:28.250> later<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:30.400> that's

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
be an answer but that's later so that's

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.550 
be an answer but that's later so that's
working<00:04:33.260> through<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.620> pine<00:04:33.890> yes
