00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.850
 after 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.180
 I think there are two misunderstandings, but one is the rest so far 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.559
 In the country by adding two and a half years post-processing system 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.439
 It is to cmos development of this post-processing system 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.890
 Do not need 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.099
 The first point of the main is 10,000 yen diesel is registered 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.980
 But 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.910
 Do not run to high speed, skypetechnologiessa high speed 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 It is like a certain gasoline engine 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.980
 The point that is the engine is crystal house 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.790
 It's all about keeping it active 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.280
 It was rare with the opposite idea 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 The freedom of the high compression ratio is very good to go to the box 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.540
 This item is a good challenge for this item 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.270
 It is sluggish for a while and the situation is appointed to the scenic spot of the signboard 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.820
 Today's economy is dealing with it at the expense of fuel consumption 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.400
 Is the engine of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.559
 Hirose starts hearing certification by hearing it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.890
 Let's hear the timing to do 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 It is by this that pension and then improve output 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 It is a harmful substance 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 It is greatly reduced 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.090
 Name is the width of the Seibu period 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.399
 I'm good at being able to manage Crank piston in the future 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.490
 What's it? The weight of the spinning Lutz is greatly reduced 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 It is possible by this, it is strong to high turn 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.970
 I think I was able to accelerate the wonderful engine 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:46.319
 It is the first morning in the morning, and then the engine walks in the air 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.680
 It is until 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.750
 Don't buy it A means of seven years that combustion stability was a big issue 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.220
 As always using exhaust vvt system, but warm exhaust gas 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 By the same day 9 days report 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.790
 The temperature of the inhaled air soars for the second time 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.820
 It's a piezo injector 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.329
 It is this adopted 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.639
 When the temperature reaches a certain level, a uniform mixture of air 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.979
 I greatly contribute to the screen saying 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.369
 End 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.119
 Or laugh 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.139
 A new idea that overturns the concept of fiscal umpire politics 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:31.329
 Expressed in the same way that it was put out to another internal combustion engine port 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.489
 Imagine imagio in any case 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.349
 How about reading slice I want to write 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.880
 With thought 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.409
 Figure 1 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.999
