00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.889
 hello together in the parliament again 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.990
 Today we are busy with a bit 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.720
 hardware and I do that very often 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.970
 asked babbel wants to save yours 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.350
 I just say photos and there I am 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.990
 store my photos on the computer 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.300
 but it's that simple 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.880
 not because i store my photos 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.310
 not on the computer but also on 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.780
 the hard drives 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.480
 I've been in business for a long time 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 and I just started the photos 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.660
 on the cds then save on dvds 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.670
 and so on the cameras will always be 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.180
 bigger and make bigger and bigger 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.220
 images 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
 The data gets bigger and bigger 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.930
 Of course, it was pretty fast 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.810
 The problem was that he did not do everything 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.810
 could save quickly and not everything 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.060
 That's why there is an optimal way to save 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.980
 here practically only one possibility that 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.640
 we take photos on the hard drives 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.580
 to save 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.250
 the hard drives that are at the moment yes 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.249
 But the prices always fluctuate 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 you get a 2 terabyte hard disk in the 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:18.310
 cut between 80 and 100 euros 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.729
 that fits quite well because two 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.069
 terabytes even for raw data for big ones 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.369
 red data like for example at nikon the 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.950
 800 thus a file in the raw format of 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.579
 nick and 800 is almost 40 megabytes 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 great that of course every amount of wood 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.429
 therefore a hard disk two terabytes 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.950
 is a very good solution 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.350
 you see a few hard drives here 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.170
 are so small houses finished 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.509
 have and here in this cottage 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.880
 I save my data so that 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.280
 Hard disks I always do not buy in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.149
 any housing but i buy 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 she naked like this for example and 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.779
 So I get the data from the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.789
 memory card or from the computer 

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.610
 can dub the hard disk 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.280
 I use the so-called 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.040
 docking station docking stations that is 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.290
 for example, a docking station from icy 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 box costs about 20 20 25 euro 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.510
 they are 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.010
 really cheap now 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.580
 practically only the docking station 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.620
 There are also connection cables 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.690
 for example usb or esata and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.550
 course power connection and but 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.280
 docking station can be switched off 1 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.630
 So i connect a docking 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 stations via usb with my mac so 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.370
 I'll go with either the imac or with 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.670
 macbook pro works quite well 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:57.400
 and yes the hard drive will be here 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.239
 practically put in this way 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.099
 the whole thing out 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.739
 yes that's a bit technical, of course 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.280
 whoever values ​​design should 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.470
 Of course, to the hard drives in the housing 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.019
 to grab but I think that's ok 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.450
 Fits quite well and the hard drives 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.000
 then store with me when you go to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.190
 For example, not in a docking station 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 then put them in my pocket 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.400
 such colorful cases which I find very 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.799
 handy that a silicone case 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.079
 reminds me a bit 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.209
 kitchen utensils or any 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.400
 toys so that looks definitely 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.200
 very good and the hard drive is like that 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.109
 very well protected so i want to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.389
 still not subject to the ground 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.579
 she breaks anyway but everyone 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.850
 case she is very good 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.340
 protected and you can stack them and so 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.470
 there are such docking stations i 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.519
 show one more now that still 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.260
 a hard drive in it 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.739
 I show now a docking station 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.230
 that's one for two now 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.019
 This is of course designed for hard drives 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.760
 extremely practical because it is with me 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.730
 always so i have a hard drive for 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.370
 I have a hard drive on my projects 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.160
 for photos and a hard drive must 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.220
 of course backup so yes back up 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.639
 my computer does not have a machine 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.330
 So that's awake up program of mac 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.180
 and for example my my backup 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.539
 hard disk and then in this housing 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.169
 or in this docking station and others 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.240
 two hard drives live here 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.529
 and the beautiful at this print in 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.569
 it is not only 3 5 stations 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.360
 inch hard disks to be put in there 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.259
 but also smaller 25 so it 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.659
 works both 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.529
 that's why here's one too 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:52.740
 recess yes so you can for such a 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.949
 docking station larger and smaller 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:02.310
 use hard drives and that is now 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.060
 even icy box is with usb 3 ever 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.279
 available 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.999
 I have it with usb 3 but mine 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:11.849
 computer has only usb so at apple 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.800
 I think there is the latest 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.419
 generation I do not know that exactly 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.639
 but I believe in new creation 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.419
 already usb3 but I have even older 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.219
 generation 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.589
 so now i have usb2 but the 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:29.430
 are backward compatible with this docking 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:32.849
 stations and there is this docking 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.370
 stations also as a free variant 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.349
 and of course that works too 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.229
 you dub faster data 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:44.490
 and yes, everything fits 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.839
 All right, I can only warn you 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.069
 So please do not hang too many 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.500
 docking stations and not too many 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.050
 hard drives to computer ran so three 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.729
 that it is already limit so at 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.379
 I'm fine with everything I can 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.719
 from experience I do not have any 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.550
 had crashes but I have in 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.169
 Internet can be read on windows 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.749
 that happen to one or the other 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.339
 the disk is ejected times 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.310
 Of course not so nice especially if 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:14.249
 but it is in the work process 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.069
 Well , two works on each one 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.080
 case three works for me now 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.999
 probably also work and 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.279
 if it gets more then it will be fine 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.560
 critical yes that's why less is more 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:29.629
 Just put everything on the hard drives 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.310
 distribute that with less 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.509
 hard drive works and then becomes 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.879
 that everything is going well 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.740
 that's it for today so that's it 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.599
 my space as I already 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.639
 I have already been announced 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.889
 very often asked about it pavel 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.550
 you save all the photos and stuff 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.940
 continue the whole 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.190
 data and so I make the good solution 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.470
 works fine and you can do a lot 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.930
 quickly replace the hard drives very much 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.790
 quickly connect others without you 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.060
 Thousands of homes 1000 power supply and so on 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.110
 So, then I would say until then 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.870
 next time 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.480
 I 'm going to America soon, I 'm glad 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.330
 already on it I will take many photos there 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.670
 make make many movies going from there 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.820
 of course report and then say 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.740
 I have five good flight especially that 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.660
 I quite good for airport come in 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.740
 the weather conditions these days 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.050
 not that easy 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.620
 So we'll see each other soon 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.620
 bye bye
