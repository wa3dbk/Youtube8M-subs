00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone is certain 13014 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.130
 is today a small video yet 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.919
 year is only five so 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.190
 today I received my armor saddle 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.750
 kais so it 's spider it's a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.769
 shockproof shell so because I find 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 that the phone is so fragile in 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.890
 him even so after I'm already going 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 open 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 because I wanted to say that they were 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 agreed what their package was 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.880
 lamÃ©ac as soon as they had then so there 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 with them the little ones if we see that that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 it is in fact this is a shockproof 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.189
 presence of a grip is like 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.439
 it acts like an armor because 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.700
 sarko we can see all the fans on the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 facade in progress so a bit like the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 most of the crates a new one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.989
 authentic journey in 1925 web to the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.340
 bomb to watsa ie open so 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.539
 it's going to be one face to a friend 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.539
 we'll see it later 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 then there and then mark and identified 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.170
 26.4 of producers therefore for a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 so that's really not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 behind but behind easy for 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.340
 prove that it's an original there is a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 little hold up at the end but hey it's 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.640
 not very interesting it's not even 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.869
 ten French screens with mackerel 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 solid and system-based protections 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.720
 double layer shock absorption 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 friends the ear he sends his stooges 1 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
 if you aim at one you want to do 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.799
 craftsmen but that's not far to see that that 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.490
 is a super endless cycle that's okay 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.500
 observe what we will say is good 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 accurate that the boxes ferrero rock 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.090
 or he saw some successes then 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.850
 the attacker the same as there are marks 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.409
 of fingers - it's normal that makes me 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
 crazy hands of the fingers so we 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 understands here so it's rignault 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.400
 inside so fitting into the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.890
 plastic 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 I know we're not far from these 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 so-called to allow air to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.460
 actually go out of arms his fans he 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 can as if by the way phone captures 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.880
 the heat do not for the homeland 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860
 for all edges of the races to know a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.420
 little more then we can see the pimples 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.649
 by the buttons did not depart in 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 apart from that it is 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.350
 soft rubber the no no no to this 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.909
 base actually doing his home classes this is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.219
 of a bureaucracy nor so simulate 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.210
 in and he's in front of a part 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.200
 seconds and we can see mutations 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.090
 here and we can ask 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.439
 you see that I do not have too much 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 look to remove some early when 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.439
 even if it is for video at 36.3 I 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 they had to wear to date just that 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.720
 it's really crap would have thought you 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.800
 see here 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.490
 that's what you quoque is it 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 really very mean which absorbs the 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.360
 shocks or run out on the edges 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.360
 can see see so it's molded in 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.580
 and me but a lot of time so we 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.740
 can see here that there are small people 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.290
 feet a little pompous does that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.790
 act like a bin 2 which is good for 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.440
 them why am I exactly laying on the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.570
 trick finally on the loss insurance he's going 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.510
 also be the surface and then have to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.620
 it's a harder plastic actually that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.670
 would have said it was hard was 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.090
 maybe to light it up not those of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.260
 plastic of actually yeah but they do 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.250
 nexus singh 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.020
 but the body and soul with like 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.900
 phone what lg korea selections 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.990
 make a phone to put me back in 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990
 square 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.410
 I was much easier to put in 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.220
 sale 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.990
 so we will not keep the fans were there 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.350
 in there so we speak in this sense but 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.580
 like that 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.410
 so if the focus is this amount 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.530
 you see you put a notch in you 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.760
 think relies on woods is serious 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.320
 that's it was seized the phone does not 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.250
 will fall in addition to me what 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.390
 I love and this shell is that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.580
 seen although a thickness that is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.570
 to say that when I pose like that it's okay 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.730
 not put it on the screen and on the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.050
 plastic and around and the same for the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.760
 back there you welcome famous little pine 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.709
 who really have that but he does not impose himself 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 on my bike 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.290
 the camera does not go beyond that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.209
 it's really great that it's beyond 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.380
 basic of a few millimeters and that's 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.160
 quite embarrassing when we ask it's from 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.330
 know unstable collection is 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.660
 perfectly stable you can type 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.760
 posts 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.680
 so we will test the buttons 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.030
 buttons by his skin the click on 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.030
 not hear the clip so 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.580
 so we can see that she is actually 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.880
 a little harder pressed so it's not 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.870
 very bad 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.730
 since it will not support any 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.400
 only power I can really do 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.480
 on the sasaki button not all alone we're going 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.010
 try that otherwise given volume 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.780
 Thursday their hearing so you see I 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.410
 slap it in front of the choices that there 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 do not do anything that does not stop at all 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.000
 the proper functioning of the buttons then 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.900
 we can see that there is little hole so is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.459
 really much wider for the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.450
 Jack plug 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:16.109
 if this camp and focus it comes to start 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.560
 we missed the money more media 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.450
 it was a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.830
 so still small secondary audi 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.789
 micro mic seconds and yes if it had to 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.919
 French was good then we can see 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.240
 that he would be dead 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.430
 and here we see they cash pippen 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.319
 if they win spiegel project then the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.150
 small holes for lots tell us 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:36.479
 speakers and the usb allenou by their 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.590
 parents focus here so squeezing well 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.479
 woodjean garnered a lot of material 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.599
 for honda meals with no more 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.740
 long live things like that 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.449
 I can say other I think it's 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.000
 all the grip is really 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.650
 nice because it's almost the same 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.240
 texture that the back of the nexus s a small 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.470
 little more but hey there is the edge the acquired 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.349
 and who hangs in water clings it's 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.759
 black rubber or fear it in 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.810
 more internet in what he does not go out 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.569
 easily when is there a notch 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.500
 Florent interiors pushed on for the 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.449
 go out here's me what I 'm doing it's 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.389
 that the thumb and that must here thank you 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:11.650
 last here you see that this is 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.479
 galley and galettes down to go out so 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.680
 it's a good point while it looks 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.210
 easy enough to go in but they will 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.449
 to get out of these practices because 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.310
 that it makes the thing safer I think 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.780
 that's all so I have not 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.729
 of accessories in iran months as the hull 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.020
 but no, I did not ask for more 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.710
 so ai say I want more so 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.060
 see the coke and make a little 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.159
 fight behind you can see 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.750
 by the way as yamgnane marked Syrian 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:39.099
 amber here it will be everything for 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.020
 today or with the rating only if he 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.830
 spiegel's dead part for the nexus heinz 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.830
 channel +
