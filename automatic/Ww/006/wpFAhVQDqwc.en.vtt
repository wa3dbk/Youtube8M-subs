talk about is phytoplankton
it's<00:00:17.360> a<00:00:17.630> algae<00:00:18.200> which<00:00:18.560> will<00:00:19.630> give<00:00:20.630> me<00:00:21.020> no<00:00:21.140> acids

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
it's a algae which will give me no acids

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.760 
it's a algae which will give me no acids
and<00:00:21.920> fatty<00:00:22.250> acids<00:00:22.790> to<00:00:23.060> your<00:00:23.660> corals<00:00:24.140> new

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
and fatty acids to your corals new

and fatty acids to your corals new
crustaceans<00:00:25.550> in<00:00:25.730> your<00:00:25.910> aquarium<00:00:27.670> you<00:00:28.670> feed<00:00:28.940> it

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
crustaceans in your aquarium you feed it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.770 
crustaceans in your aquarium you feed it
in<00:00:29.270> there<00:00:29.510> you<00:00:29.780> dose<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.200> in<00:00:30.350> about<00:00:31.390> five<00:00:32.390> mil

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
in there you dose it in about five mil

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.860 
in there you dose it in about five mil
for<00:00:33.110> every<00:00:33.320> 200<00:00:33.500> liters<00:00:34.070> daily<00:00:34.690> there's<00:00:35.690> no

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
for every 200 liters daily there's no

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.160 
for every 200 liters daily there's no
real<00:00:36.109> set<00:00:36.440> rule<00:00:36.769> how<00:00:37.249> much<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.640> dose<00:00:38.079> but<00:00:39.079> if

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
real set rule how much to dose but if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.509 
real set rule how much to dose but if
you<00:00:39.230> do<00:00:39.379> start<00:00:39.679> to<00:00:39.739> see<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:39.949> bit<00:00:40.190> of<00:00:40.249> a<00:00:40.280> green

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
you do start to see a bit of a green

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.250 
you do start to see a bit of a green
film<00:00:40.910> building<00:00:41.480> up<00:00:41.570> on<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.749> inside<00:00:42.050> your

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
film building up on the inside your

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.479 
film building up on the inside your
aquarium<00:00:42.620> you're<00:00:42.710> probably<00:00:42.980> putting<00:00:43.249> too

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
aquarium you're probably putting too

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.509 
aquarium you're probably putting too
much<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.940> one<00:00:44.179> in

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.959 

next<00:00:50.519> one<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> talk<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:52.170> first

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
next one I talk about is what first

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
next one I talk about is what first
brought<00:00:53.969> Fuhrer's<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.600> feed<00:00:54.920> your<00:00:56.750> SPS<00:00:57.750> LPS

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
brought Fuhrer's will feed your SPS LPS

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
brought Fuhrer's will feed your SPS LPS
most<00:00:59.159> you<00:00:59.280> corals<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.850> feed<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
most you corals and feed off of them to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.470 
most you corals and feed off of them to
me<00:01:01.019> of<00:01:01.109> crustaceans<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> feed<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.159> of<00:01:02.280> them

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
me of crustaceans and feed off of them

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.960 
me of crustaceans and feed off of them
the<00:01:04.290> rotifer<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> itself<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:05.610> feed

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the rotifer is itself will actually feed

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
the rotifer is itself will actually feed
off<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> green<00:01:06.479> phytoplankton<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.649> put

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
off the green phytoplankton that you put

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
off the green phytoplankton that you put
in<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.190> well<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.240> work<00:01:09.450> hand<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.899> hand

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in as well so they work hand in hand

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
in as well so they work hand in hand
they<00:01:10.799> feed<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.190> of<00:01:11.220> green<00:01:11.610> phyto<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
they feed off of green phyto and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.499 
they feed off of green phyto and
multiply<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:14.190> then<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.180> therefore

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
multiply and then they get therefore

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.320 
multiply and then they get therefore
their<00:01:15.899> food<00:01:16.200> source<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.009> corals

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.760 

from<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> last<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.380> talked<00:01:25.530> about

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
from the last one and I talked about

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.990 
from the last one and I talked about
pods<00:01:26.550> pods<00:01:27.300> are<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.660> larger<00:01:28.020> crustacean<00:01:29.000> larger

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
pods pods are a larger crustacean larger

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900 
pods pods are a larger crustacean larger
bug<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.930> fish<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
bug the fish can see these and so

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.080 
bug the fish can see these and so
mandarins<00:01:34.250> will<00:01:35.250> Peck<00:01:35.520> them<00:01:35.670> off<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.880> glass

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mandarins will Peck them off the glass

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.670 
mandarins will Peck them off the glass
and<00:01:36.120> off<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.690> rocks<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.290> day<00:01:37.440> long

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and off the rocks all day long

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
and off the rocks all day long
absolutely<00:01:38.220> love<00:01:38.550> them<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.480> good<00:01:39.660> for

absolutely love them really good for
them<00:01:40.100> our<00:01:41.100> gifts<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:42.060> feed<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
them our gifts will feed off them so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.140 
them our gifts will feed off them so
mean<00:01:43.890> butterfly<00:01:44.280> fish<00:01:44.550> will<00:01:44.729> feed<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.000> them

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
mean butterfly fish will feed off them

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.580 
mean butterfly fish will feed off them
as<00:01:45.240> well<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.020> finicky<00:01:46.320> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
as well they can be really finicky for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
as well they can be really finicky for
yours<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.250> great<00:01:47.700> having<00:01:47.940> your<00:01:48.300> aquarium

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
there's another benefit of having them

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.150 
there's another benefit of having them
in<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.300> aquarium<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> algae

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
in your aquarium is they will be algae

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.240 
in your aquarium is they will be algae
off<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.430> glass<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.720> rocks<00:01:55.250> don't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
off your glass and off your rocks don't

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.320 
off your glass and off your rocks don't
go<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.670> them<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> thinking<00:01:57.090> they're

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
go and put them in thinking they're

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.150 
go and put them in thinking they're
going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> keep<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.470> Brigid<00:01:58.830> tank<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
going to keep you know Brigid tank of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.940 
going to keep you know Brigid tank of
algae<00:01:59.550> but<00:01:59.729> they<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.450> towards<00:02:00.930> helping<00:02:01.170> with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
algae but they go towards helping with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.480 
algae but they go towards helping with
algae<00:02:02.430> issues<00:02:03.470> they<00:02:04.470> also<00:02:04.710> feed<00:02:05.190> off<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
algae issues they also feed off the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.020 
algae issues they also feed off the
green<00:02:05.700> fighter<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.420> talked<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.720> earlier

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
now we'll talk about how to add in and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.130 
now we'll talk about how to add in and
how<00:02:18.829> they<00:02:19.010> will<00:02:19.129> work<00:02:19.310> together<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.900> Rotter

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
how they will work together the Rotter

nighttime<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:24.019> way<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.500> get<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.680> chance<00:02:24.890> to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
nighttime that way they get a chance to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.160 
nighttime that way they get a chance to
settle<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.610> aquarium<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.299> are<00:02:27.049> not

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
settle in the aquarium and are not

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
settle in the aquarium and are not
eating<00:02:27.439> all<00:02:27.560> eaten<00:02:28.280> by<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.459> fish<00:02:28.549> all<00:02:29.090> at<00:02:29.269> once

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
eating all eaten by the fish all at once

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.780 
eating all eaten by the fish all at once
as<00:02:29.959> they<00:02:30.290> go<00:02:30.409> in<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.780> green<00:02:32.989> phytoplankton<00:02:33.790> I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
as they go in the green phytoplankton I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.059 
as they go in the green phytoplankton I
tend<00:02:35.329> to<00:02:35.359> feed<00:02:35.569> this<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.049> daytime<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.799> it

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
tend to feed this in the daytime so it

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.490 
tend to feed this in the daytime so it
naturally<00:02:37.579> gets<00:02:38.269> all<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.689> rata<00:02:39.079> furs<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.409> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
naturally gets all the rata furs and the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.979 
naturally gets all the rata furs and the
pods<00:02:39.739> up<00:02:40.430> into<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.819> water<00:02:41.000> column<00:02:41.090> feeding<00:02:41.900> on

pods up into the water column feeding on

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.349 
pods up into the water column feeding on
the<00:02:42.079> green<00:02:42.290> plankton<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.909> corals<00:02:44.239> will

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
the green plankton and the corals will

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.330 
the green plankton and the corals will
start<00:02:44.540> opening<00:02:44.690> up<00:02:45.049> eaten<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.769> eating<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
start opening up eaten on eating the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.339 
start opening up eaten on eating the
green<00:02:46.730> phytoplankton<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.750> they'll<00:02:48.170> also

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
green phytoplankton and they'll also

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.199 
green phytoplankton and they'll also
start<00:02:48.829> consuming<00:02:49.190> some<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.639> raw<00:02:49.790> führer's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
start consuming some of the raw führer's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.360 
start consuming some of the raw führer's
and<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.540> pods<00:02:50.810> which<00:02:51.230> are<00:02:51.440> up<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.159> about

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and the pods which are up and about

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.280 
and the pods which are up and about
pretty<00:02:53.150> eating<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.690> green<00:02:53.870> water<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:57.019> yeah

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
pretty eating the green water so yeah

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.259 
pretty eating the green water so yeah
