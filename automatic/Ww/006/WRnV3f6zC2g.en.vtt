I'm sure I will in the future so I
started<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.609> channel<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> turned<00:01:03.480> 50<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.660 
started my channel when I turned 50 and
I<00:01:04.199> thought<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> had<00:01:05.129> already<00:01:05.339> been

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I thought you know I had already been

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
I thought you know I had already been
having<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.360> night<00:01:07.080> sweats<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:08.040> call

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
having some night sweats as they call

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.020 
having some night sweats as they call
them<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.700> had<00:01:09.000> started<00:01:09.619> years<00:01:10.619> ago<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
them those had started years ago and I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
them those had started years ago and I
had<00:01:12.180> gotten<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> course

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
had gotten a lot of them over the course

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.859 
had gotten a lot of them over the course
of<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.250> summer<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> thought<00:01:14.970> okay<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of one summer so I thought okay here we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
of one summer so I thought okay here we
go<00:01:15.900> where<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:17.009> into<00:01:17.189> para<00:01:17.430> menopause

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
go where I'm going into para menopause

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.870 
go where I'm going into para menopause
and<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.680> goes<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.490> start<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and so as time goes on I will start to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
and so as time goes on I will start to
have<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.570> hot<00:01:21.840> flashes<00:01:22.350> during<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> day<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
have more hot flashes during the day and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270 
have more hot flashes during the day and
you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.299> menopause<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> reality<00:01:26.070> for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you know menopause will be a reality for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
you know menopause will be a reality for
me

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
me

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
me
well<00:01:27.500> now<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.680> 51<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> found<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.420> have

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
well now I'm 51 and I found that I have

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
well now I'm 51 and I found that I have
been<00:01:31.110> instead<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> increasing<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.520> hot

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
been instead of increasing my hot

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.539 
been instead of increasing my hot
flashes<00:01:33.240> I've<00:01:33.450> had<00:01:33.840> fewer<00:01:34.350> hot<00:01:34.619> flashes<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
flashes I've had fewer hot flashes and I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
flashes I've had fewer hot flashes and I
guess<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.450> how<00:01:37.409> menopause<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:39.290> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
guess this is what how menopause is it's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
guess this is what how menopause is it's
kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> crazy<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.430> over<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
kind of crazy it's kind of all over the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
kind of crazy it's kind of all over the
map<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> comes<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> goes<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
map it kind of comes and goes it you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
map it kind of comes and goes it you
know<00:01:43.530> visit<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.000> goes<00:01:45.119> away<00:01:45.270> for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a while so the point of this video is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 
a while so the point of this video is

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
so while it is embarrassing it's a

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.590 
so while it is embarrassing it's a
natural<00:04:26.070> part<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.370> life<00:04:26.430> just<00:04:26.940> make<00:04:27.330> light<00:04:27.570> of
