00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.820

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.130
 of being released to the consoles plus 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.410
 game was originally released for pc 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 a long time ago and it was also 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.860

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.920

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.160
 complete with the new expansion reached 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.079
 consoles a few days ago well I 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.620
 I've been playing the Playstation 4 version 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.190
 and the game is just fantastic 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.220
 fantastic staff I too recommend 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.910
 if you like this genre lech rankings 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.850
 dande crowley isometric view this game 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.489
 is a work of art for those who like this 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 type of game the playstation 4 version is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.670
 fantastic graphic excellent dubbing 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.439
 frame rate is the complete package the game is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.080
 really very good and I recommend 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.850
 too in this new version of the game you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.829
 will find a new class called 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.979
 cruise the class I'm playing 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.710
 what are you seeing there nobody clay 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.740
 background very very very nice indeed 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.170
 this class I had played the game on pc 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 and I had played with a monk who 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.770
 Com real moves I really 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.899
 I liked the class 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.329
 but as that class a new class it 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.679
 knew to choose to and start the game with 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.109
 This class and I'm having fun. 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.130
 The class is really really cool. 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.329
 and I intend to play with other classes 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.389
 When I finish the game with this 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.759
 class or reach the maximum level that 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:55.579
 in this version is 70 in the last version 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.639
 level is 60 but in this version it is 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.130
 70 and something new in that version with 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.560
 this expansion rip off skies 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.979
 they added a new chapter then 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.520
 I believe that it's down you have more 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.680
 or less two to three hours of extra play 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.350
 I had not played Devil 3 in 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 consoles and I did not know how they had 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.099
 slotted the game's functionality into the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.470
 control and with much but very nice 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.430
 You have all your skills in the four 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 main buttons have 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.099
 r another r 2 is very nice staff 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.590
 really cool and they put it 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.769
 an elusive movement and the analog 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.290
 right is not for many things but it is 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.920
 Nice thing that they put something and if everything 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.750
 the luti evolution system of the character 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.500
 customization of the character with the parts 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.299
 of armor you find weapons 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.209
 shields are super easy to use 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.170
 accessed and used in this version 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 consoles 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.669
 Summing Up Devil's Team 3 Rip Off Skies 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.030
 It scared me for the quality I really 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.859
 I did not expect anything of this quality in the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.230
 playstation 4 i thought there are some 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.169
 brake problems in reiti of the way 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.930
 that you do the customization the 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:18.719
 dut characters like they would 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.919
 fit all this system on the consoles 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:25.980
 but it really works very well 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.439
 and multiplayer is also super super 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 super cool I played against the three 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.459
 people 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.129
 many monsters on the screen and by 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.549
 no second frame rate dropped the game 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.919
 it got slower not everything perfect 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.579
 So I recommend this game 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:47.280
 Do you like this genre or played it? 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.979
 of vultures the pc as I was with the foot 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.470
 behind to get the consoles buy 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.189
 because it's really worth a lot if it does not 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.269
 played 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:00.090
 Jorge, because this version is not 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.530

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.079

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.790
