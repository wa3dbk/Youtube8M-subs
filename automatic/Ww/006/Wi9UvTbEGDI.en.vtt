00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 introducing us to our flamenco guitar technique 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.310
 we find a very large diversity 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.900
 d 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.329
 crawls p charges 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.019
 d 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380
 touches with the thumb 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 What we are going to start doing is to know a little bit the position of the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.870
 right hand 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.830
 to get acquainted with the special exhibition center 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.310
 this 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.150
 total 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.090
 we have that tampa bay 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 basically three positions 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.260
 the thumb is placed on this one 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.760
 rope number 6 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 which will allow having a movement 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.880
 thus 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.580
 encompassing what the terrain is 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.130
 strong this form 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.320
 However 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.430
 there is one more 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.870
 what is the chopped position that we are going to lift the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.920
 arm 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.960
 right and we will go 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 allowing to travel in a special way the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 by the way of the amy not of the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 about the situation of the ropes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 we also have the traces 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 the weird thing that is properly a popular within what is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.970
 this kind of this musical 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.930
 there are many species for more 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.680
 - equipment the first one that we are going to see is called the three-finger radius the hatred of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.890
 three fingers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.930
 part of a basic position 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 of the hand that assumes 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 this position 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 part 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.950
 and is that our index fingers 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.190
 medium 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.640
 and cancel 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 they will be placed directly on the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.000
 by estrous estrus finger 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.610
 or is this going to happen 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.990
 park this position 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.470
 if this one realize 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.549
 I'm placing 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.849
 I'm taking 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.899
 the back of the nails 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.549
 to the thumb 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.549
 all the fingers so placed here 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.259
 at the time it is located in this way 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.739
 my fingers were imprisoned so call it 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.029
 so if I ing imposes little force 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.429
 the fingers can not 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 cr the released as they are 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.059
 they are arrested 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.369
 thumb 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.809
 However 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.399
 yes I libero 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:45.229
 this little force that is placing is important that it be little 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.159
 force 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.510
 went from the following 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.510
 a little the tiie or 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.799
 release the ring finger 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.700
 he touches him 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.649
 to the middle finger 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.649
 now it will be the int finger 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.359
 what was this process 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.399
 they are three fingers 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.399
 with three strokes 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.629
 let's make a clarification an important step 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.079
 at the moment when the finger 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.999
 I heard index 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.599
 sd 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.229
 he executed his movement 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.229
 happens or yes 1 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.089
 and they have realized 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.089
 all returned to the initial position 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.949
 and finally also the index does 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.559
 then the process is as follows 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.579
 ring finger 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.499
 middle finger 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.309
 index finger with return 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:51.889
 and finally 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.889
 the same challenge that is a song this is dominated 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.149
 very well if this movement does not take it to the instrument properly 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:01.129
 it happens I think 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.049
 we'll see 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.049
 we start from the traditional position 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.739
 graphic the flamenco guitar of any type of guitar 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.149
 and from here 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.759
 let's do what I explained earlier 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.909
 we carry 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.949
 well already the thumb every day 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.419
 you get to perceive 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.749
 here you can see it 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:26.740
 so 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.800
 at the moment 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.050
 in which I libero 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.469
 nor first finger 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.180
 your headquarters 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.450
 there the execution 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.450
 on the ropes 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.110
 release the middle finger 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.340
 and now the finger indexes 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.340
 with their respective return from others 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 and finally the so-called case 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.159
 the process 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.159
 do this 1 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.520
 and again 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 one 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.339
 if I 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.260
 something consecutively this movement is not going to give this 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
 this result 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 and the sound result a cut this 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.930
 percent 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.569
 as well 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.569
 faster tel 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.030
 both this type of accents sudan very much in this music 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.130
 tuck
