00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.010
 is to introduce gila even though this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.889
 material for the child 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.410
 The interesting thing is always to show a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.170
 form of work that is already part of the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.029
 in the classroom itself so that the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 child feel safe and face the art 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.740
 how work increase process 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 so it's always interesting to leave a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.019
 table without much object a sheet of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 so that when she eventually 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.059
 come and knock down a piece of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.980
 Swiss material is basic is easy 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.410
 find in any situation 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 a detail is this. 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.300
 sponge within the cap 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 any type of residue 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 she makes the child is not to use 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 much water which is a characteristic 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 of the child while working 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 together to change what makes gila 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.680
 disassembles where work does not give a 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.600
 good result so with you and choose and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
 limits the use of water 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 then all I'll be even more 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.799
 essential is to find a way to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 quality is with a fundamental resource 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.360
 from there a first activity 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.720
 What can we do with the child? 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.659
 animals 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.409
 the animals that do not exist here are 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.350
 United 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.350
 In this case, here is this chicken d'angola 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.710
 municio proposes a way for the child to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.710
 if a ball 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.330
 I avoid getting too tired. 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.380
 time in my hand that's why I 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.390
 always after a while I announced 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.630
 eventually modest clay and left 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.009
 on the table to avoid contact of the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.479
 heat of our hand 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:09.090
 from that ball I'm going to do something 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.580
 like a beak I always remember 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.099
 something like a chicken's thigh and it's 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.290
 common in conversation with the child 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.080
 depending on the age and I resort to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.140
 some form familiar to her 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.900
 mainly in the food area 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.930
 so I really speak the thigh is a 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 croquette the kibble to what the child already has 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.580
 a direct perception facilitating of air 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.250
 logically with time I will use a 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.739
 expects a cylinder of a shape 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.450
 essentially simple and it is through 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.280
 exactly the simple way I have 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 that make the child think of the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.140
 object to be built had not not 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 I'm building and immediately 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.519
 chicken build a ball and from there 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.739
 I go detail year and the child goes in 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.489
 thinking of building this photo then 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:09.590
 Build this pussy and I'll put 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.590
 call there I'll go the other way 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.549
 In this case I can already hit on the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.500
 piece of wood so that it does not have to 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.730
 continue to work with your hands or 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 all the time 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 is a construction that has always been 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.730
 running the water only the tips of the fingers 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 realizing 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:48.349
 when I have more the way I go 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:53.769
 make a little pussy is using the tip 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:58.209
 of the finger and if that's left 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.209
 I'm going to make the chicken child 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.510
 It is not always essential water sometimes 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.989
 it is necessary to reduce a little force 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.780
 At the end of time water does not solve 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:16.880
 everything if you the excess plant does not pass 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:21.079
 remove excess water from the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.180
 but here I already built this 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:31.539
 Piece is just that 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.970
 after drying two or three days 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.509
 I have a one piece that can be 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.099
 painted or burned that the process of 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.020
 peace that there is any piece that 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.710
 durable but this feature does not have at all 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:50.120
 place and then I can partly there 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.729
 for painting is a process that also 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.300
 requires a little discipline that I 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 I have to paint each color more matches 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.979
 dark for more light and phases 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.979
 different hope and on top of the other
