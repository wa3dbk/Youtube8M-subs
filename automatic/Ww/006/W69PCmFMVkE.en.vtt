00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.210
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.080
 and my first time I'll never forget that 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.170
 summer night if the great one had arrived 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.000
 day that I was waiting for so much 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.540
 I was ready for this new challenge 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.590
 but unfortunately 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.790
 I do not know my brother 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.470
 my first time at the stadium as well as 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.960
 all the first time in any 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 thing is not easy, much less in a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.820
 football stadium why you humble and 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.400
 friendly game server ball will tell you 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.260
 how can you survive your first time 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.320
 if in a state in a stadium we 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.470
 get excited so let's go with the theme of 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.470
 today 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.360
 the first crossing that you will have to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.930
 live when you get to the stadium is the row 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.930
 to enter 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.210
 it does not matter which stadium you go to if it's the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.490
 azteca stadium santiago bernabéu la 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.300
 mouth candy or even the very same 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.130
 omnilife always but there will always be row 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.530
 to enter a stadium so there's 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.810
 two soups or you arrive early to the stadium or 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.460
 apply the see with permission commitment 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.040

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 with permission with permission to the layer is 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.229
 blood coming out I 'm just covering myself 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.330
 with a handkerchief because you told me 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.330
 so you want to bleed like your mother 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.189
 since you entered the stadium look for the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.320
 better places quickly that if you do not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 I recommend that you feel close to where 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.539

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.659
