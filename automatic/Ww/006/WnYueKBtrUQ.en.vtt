that's<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.670> DC<00:00:17.670> pump<00:00:19.640> as<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.150> might

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300

24:12 18s 5 and 7 and I'm gonna show you
a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.550> experiment<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.600> did<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
a little experiment that I did just to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.310 
a little experiment that I did just to
see<00:00:45.020> how<00:00:46.020> much<00:00:46.940> these<00:00:47.940> pumps<00:00:48.600> heated<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
see how much these pumps heated up the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
see how much these pumps heated up the
water<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.670> side<00:00:51.030> note<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
water but on a side note I just want to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
water but on a side note I just want to
say<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:53.160> far<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> comparison<00:00:54.000> goes

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
say as far as the comparison goes

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.319 
say as far as the comparison goes
between<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> DC<00:00:55.770> pumps<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> regular

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
between the DC pumps and the regular

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
between the DC pumps and the regular
pump<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.250> mag<00:01:00.059> 5<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
pump this is a mag 5 that I have in this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it's gonna run you from bulk resupply

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
it's gonna run you from bulk resupply
it's<00:01:06.930> about<00:01:07.110> 79<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:07.979> 80<00:01:08.100> bucks<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:09.450> max

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's about 79 or 80 bucks and your max

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's about 79 or 80 bucks and your max
flow<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.380> 500<00:01:11.070> gallons<00:01:11.430> per<00:01:11.580> hour

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
flow is going to be 500 gallons per hour

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.760 
flow is going to be 500 gallons per hour
and<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.560> zero<00:01:13.830> head<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.220> all<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
and that's what zero head at all and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640 
and that's what zero head at all and
it's<00:01:16.770> gonna<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.490> 50<00:01:18.200> 50<00:01:19.200> watts<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it's gonna use about 50 50 watts of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.679 
it's gonna use about 50 50 watts of
power<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:21.090> run<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> pump<00:01:21.840> continuously<00:01:22.549> now<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.440 

kind<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.380> guess<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.890> comparable<00:01:29.729> model

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
kind of a I guess that comparable model

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.240 
kind of a I guess that comparable model
and<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> deed<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> DC<00:01:31.710> pump<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.810> ton<00:01:33.810> z

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
and a deed in a DC pump would be a ton z

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.440 
and a deed in a DC pump would be a ton z
DC<00:01:35.250> pump<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.030> run<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:38.450> 89

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
DC pump which is gonna run you about 89

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.280 
DC pump which is gonna run you about 89
dollars<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.850> 10<00:01:42.060> bucks<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:45.290> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
dollars so it's 10 bucks more but it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.830 
dollars so it's 10 bucks more but it's
gonna<00:01:46.560> run<00:01:47.100> between<00:01:47.390> 14<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.549> 30<00:01:50.549> watts<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.630> run

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
gonna run between 14 and 30 watts to run

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna run between 14 and 30 watts to run
it<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.880> forget<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:55.140> max<00:01:55.409> flow<00:01:55.740> on

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it but also don't forget the max flow on

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
it but also don't forget the max flow on
that<00:01:56.009> DC<00:01:56.700> pump<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.210> six<00:01:57.540> hundred<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.930> thirty

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that DC pump is six hundred and thirty

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.899 
that DC pump is six hundred and thirty
gallons<00:01:58.680> an<00:01:58.799> hour<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.460> getting<00:01:59.729> more

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
gallons an hour so you're getting more

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.370 
gallons an hour so you're getting more
gallons<00:02:00.329> per<00:02:00.479> hour<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:02.159> lot<00:02:02.430> less<00:02:03.380> wattage

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
gallons per hour and a lot less wattage

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.170 
gallons per hour and a lot less wattage
used<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.280> achieve<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.110> now<00:02:08.750> what<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> did<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
used to achieve that now what I did in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.590 
used to achieve that now what I did in
this<00:02:12.180> bucket<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.080> wanted<00:02:13.349> to

my sheet they put up for one I I can't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.000 
my sheet they put up for one I I can't
I'll<00:02:18.400> bow<00:02:19.030> further<00:02:19.450> mag<00:02:19.690> 12<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.500> not<00:02:20.740> that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
I'll bow further mag 12 it's not that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.660 
I'll bow further mag 12 it's not that
loud

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
loud

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.170

but the mag-7 and five are ridiculously

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.560 
but the mag-7 and five are ridiculously
loud<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:25.810> make<00:02:26.880> unreal<00:02:27.880> amount<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.390> noise

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
loud they make unreal amount of noise

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.330 
loud they make unreal amount of noise
for<00:02:29.020> how<00:02:29.200> much<00:02:29.380> money<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.770> spend<00:02:30.070> for<00:02:30.160> the

if I understand if I I may be I have
faulty<00:02:36.030> faulty<00:02:37.030> pumps<00:02:37.630> or<00:02:37.810> something<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.410> have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
faulty faulty pumps or something I have

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.760 
faulty faulty pumps or something I have
no<00:02:38.860> idea<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.790> they<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.330> loud<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.620> let

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
no idea but they are very loud and I let

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.520 
no idea but they are very loud and I let
this<00:02:41.920> run<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:43.360> few<00:02:43.630> hours<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.260> bucket

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
this run for a few hours in this bucket

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.020 
this run for a few hours in this bucket
and<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:46.180> heated<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.810> water<00:02:46.840> too<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:48.030> didn't

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
and it heated up the water too I didn't

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.580 
and it heated up the water too I didn't
measure<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.660> temperature<00:02:50.050> but<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.440> was

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
measure the temperature but it was

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.970 
measure the temperature but it was
extremely<00:02:51.100> hot<00:02:51.520> water<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:53.350> what<00:02:53.470> I'm<00:02:53.590> gonna<00:02:53.710> do

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
extremely hot water so what I'm gonna do

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.050 
extremely hot water so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:54.310> I'm<00:02:55.090> gonna<00:02:55.180> turn<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:56.080> pump<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.130> let

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
is I'm gonna turn this pump on and let

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.770 
is I'm gonna turn this pump on and let
it<00:02:58.090> run<00:02:58.710> for<00:02:59.710> an<00:02:59.800> hour<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:01.540> I'm<00:03:01.660> gonna

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it run for an hour and then I'm gonna

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
it run for an hour and then I'm gonna
put<00:03:02.080> temperature<00:03:02.830> probe<00:03:03.100> in<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.610> tent<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
put temperature probe in the tent in the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
put temperature probe in the tent in the
water<00:03:04.360> here<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:06.540> see<00:03:07.540> how<00:03:07.870> high<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.500> raises

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
water here and see how high it raises

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.950 
water here and see how high it raises
your<00:03:09.040> temperature<00:03:09.490> because<00:03:09.790> if<00:03:10.330> these<00:03:10.570> pumps

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
your temperature because if these pumps

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.390 
your temperature because if these pumps
are<00:03:11.050> raising<00:03:11.350> your<00:03:11.470> temperature<00:03:11.830> your<00:03:12.010> tank

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
are raising your temperature your tank

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.860 
are raising your temperature your tank
temperature<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.940> high<00:03:13.120> guys<00:03:13.420> you're<00:03:13.780> gonna

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
temperature that high guys you're gonna

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.440 
temperature that high guys you're gonna
be<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.370> don't<00:03:15.580> have<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> chiller<00:03:16.000> you're

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
be if you don't have a chiller you're

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.210 
be if you don't have a chiller you're
gonna<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> problem<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.590> also<00:03:17.740> if<00:03:18.190> you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
gonna have a problem but also if you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.620 
gonna have a problem but also if you
have<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.520> chiller<00:03:18.820> it's<00:03:19.120> going<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.420> kicking

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
have a chiller it's going to be kicking

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.810 
have a chiller it's going to be kicking
on<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> lot<00:03:20.140> more<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:20.590> not<00:03:20.740> only<00:03:20.890> are<00:03:21.460> you<00:03:21.610> using

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
on a lot more so not only are you using

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.780 
on a lot more so not only are you using
more<00:03:22.150> electricity<00:03:22.740> with<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:24.010> regular<00:03:24.460> pump

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
more electricity with a regular pump

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.880 
more electricity with a regular pump
versus<00:03:25.240> a<00:03:25.270> DC<00:03:25.720> pump<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.170> you're<00:03:26.320> also<00:03:26.440> using

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
versus a DC pump but you're also using

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.590 
versus a DC pump but you're also using
more<00:03:27.400> electricity<00:03:27.460> for<00:03:28.210> your<00:03:28.300> chiller

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
more electricity for your chiller

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.320 
more electricity for your chiller
turning<00:03:29.020> on<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.500> try<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.710> you<00:03:30.400> know<00:03:30.430> cool<00:03:31.120> that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
turning on to try and you know cool that

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.210 
turning on to try and you know cool that
water<00:03:31.630> down<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.680> I'm<00:03:32.800> gonna<00:03:32.890> put<00:03:33.130> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
water down so I'm gonna put the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.500 
water down so I'm gonna put the
thermometer<00:03:33.550> in<00:03:33.790> there<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.060> y'all<00:03:34.210> can<00:03:34.360> see

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
thermometer in there so y'all can see

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.610 
thermometer in there so y'all can see
the<00:03:34.600> temperature<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.050> water<00:03:35.260> right<00:03:35.560> now

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the temperature of the water right now

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.780 
the temperature of the water right now
as<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.220> sits<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.790> then<00:03:37.750> also<00:03:37.990> after<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:39.580> pump

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
as it sits and then also after the pump

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.680 
as it sits and then also after the pump
runs<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.330> one<00:03:40.360> hour<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.930> hang<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.200> one<00:03:41.350> second

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
runs for one hour so hang on one second

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
pretty dang loud for a small pump like

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.200 
pretty dang loud for a small pump like
that<00:04:42.530> especially<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.580> how<00:04:43.700> much<00:04:43.880> money<00:04:44.090> you

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
that especially for how much money you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.770 
that especially for how much money you
spend<00:04:44.480> for<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.920> alright<00:04:46.910> guys<00:04:46.970> I'll<00:04:47.600> let<00:04:47.750> it

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
spend for it so alright guys I'll let it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.900 
spend for it so alright guys I'll let it
run<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.320> we'll<00:04:49.220> check<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.460> temperature<00:04:49.820> in

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
run and we'll check the temperature in

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.090 
run and we'll check the temperature in
an<00:04:50.030> hour<00:04:50.150> all<00:04:50.720> right<00:04:52.000> all<00:04:53.000> right<00:04:53.060> we're<00:04:53.360> back

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
an hour all right all right we're back

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.700 
an hour all right all right we're back
let<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.820> pump<00:04:56.060> run<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:56.660> just<00:04:57.380> over<00:04:57.650> an<00:04:57.740> hour

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
let the pump run for just over an hour

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.510 
let the pump run for just over an hour
and<00:05:00.710> as<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.980> can<00:05:01.130> see<00:05:02.710> we're<00:05:03.710> at<00:05:03.800> seventy<00:05:04.340> nine

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
and as you can see we're at seventy nine

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.050 
and as you can see we're at seventy nine
point<00:05:05.090> five<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:05.900> started<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.880> little<00:05:07.880> over

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
point five and we started a little over

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.990 
point five and we started a little over
an<00:05:08.300> hour<00:05:08.390> later<00:05:09.040> right<00:05:10.040> eighty<00:05:10.250> two<00:05:10.400> point<00:05:10.610> six

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
an hour later right eighty two point six

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
an hour later right eighty two point six
incline<00:05:12.370> so

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.020 

three<00:05:17.620> degrees<00:05:17.949> that's<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.789> pretty

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
three degrees that's that's a pretty

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.839 
three degrees that's that's a pretty
good<00:05:19.300> jump<00:05:19.660> in<00:05:19.930> an<00:05:20.080> hour<00:05:20.259> I<00:05:20.680> mean<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.610> know<00:05:21.669> what

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
good jump in an hour I mean I know what

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.619 
good jump in an hour I mean I know what
is<00:05:22.349> kind<00:05:23.349> of<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:24.400> know<00:05:24.520> small<00:05:24.610> amount<00:05:25.539> of

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
is kind of a you know small amount of

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.450 
is kind of a you know small amount of
water<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.349> I<00:05:26.440> put<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> pump<00:05:26.889> in<00:05:27.009> but<00:05:27.220> it's

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
water that I put the pump in but it's

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.430 
water that I put the pump in but it's
still<00:05:27.699> relates<00:05:28.060> over<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.479> lot<00:05:28.900> if<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.229> whether

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
still relates over a lot if you whether

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.779 
still relates over a lot if you whether
you<00:05:29.590> have<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.770> large<00:05:31.830> blind<00:05:32.830> water<00:05:33.159> or<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> small

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
you have a large blind water or a small

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.700 
you have a large blind water or a small
the<00:05:34.090> temperature<00:05:34.509> the<00:05:35.050> heat<00:05:35.440> that<00:05:35.560> it's

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
the temperature the heat that it's

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.930 
the temperature the heat that it's
giving<00:05:35.979> off<00:05:36.099> is<00:05:36.310> still<00:05:36.550> gonna<00:05:36.699> be<00:05:36.819> the<00:05:37.000> same<00:05:37.919> so

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
giving off is still gonna be the same so

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.879 
giving off is still gonna be the same so
that's<00:05:39.940> this<00:05:40.360> another<00:05:40.690> big<00:05:40.990> reason<00:05:41.289> why<00:05:41.860> I

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
that's this another big reason why I

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.980 
that's this another big reason why I
really<00:05:42.400> don't<00:05:42.729> care<00:05:42.849> for<00:05:43.330> these<00:05:43.449> mag<00:05:43.750> Drive

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
really don't care for these mag Drive

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.510 
really don't care for these mag Drive
pumps<00:05:45.150> now<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.180> can't<00:05:47.139> vouch<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:48.099> hundred

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
pumps now I can't vouch a hundred

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.430 
pumps now I can't vouch a hundred
percent<00:05:48.610> for<00:05:49.330> how<00:05:50.259> much<00:05:50.470> heat<00:05:51.060> an<00:05:52.060> in<00:05:52.630> some<00:05:52.930> DC

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
percent for how much heat an in some DC

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.520 
percent for how much heat an in some DC
pump<00:05:53.710> will<00:05:53.860> put<00:05:54.039> out<00:05:54.159> but<00:05:54.909> I<00:05:54.940> do<00:05:55.060> know<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:56.470> I

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
pump will put out but I do know that I

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.649 
pump will put out but I do know that I
used<00:05:57.419> external<00:05:58.419> Waveline<00:05:58.900> pumps<00:05:59.440> DC<00:06:00.159> pumps<00:06:00.659> in

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
used external Waveline pumps DC pumps in

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.620 
used external Waveline pumps DC pumps in
the<00:06:02.110> system<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.500> had<00:06:02.650> in<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.800> garage<00:06:03.069> and<00:06:03.630> I

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the system I had in the garage and I

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.499 
the system I had in the garage and I
mean<00:06:05.259> they're<00:06:06.220> external<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:06.909> that<00:06:07.060> heats<00:06:07.270> not

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
mean they're external so that heats not

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.120 
mean they're external so that heats not
going<00:06:07.690> to<00:06:07.750> get<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.990> there<00:06:08.199> so<00:06:08.680> if<00:06:08.740> you<00:06:08.860> use<00:06:09.009> an

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
going to get in there so if you use an

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.620 
going to get in there so if you use an
external<00:06:09.400> DC<00:06:09.729> pump<00:06:10.090> you're<00:06:10.240> gonna<00:06:10.330> get<00:06:10.539> the

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
external DC pump you're gonna get the

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
external DC pump you're gonna get the
best<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:10.900> both<00:06:11.050> worlds<00:06:13.080> but<00:06:14.080> as<00:06:14.199> far<00:06:14.409> as<00:06:14.440> the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
best of both worlds but as far as the

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.369 
best of both worlds but as far as the
mag<00:06:14.830> drive<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.460> it<00:06:15.729> raised<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.120> temperature

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
mag drive and it raised the temperature

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.809 
mag drive and it raised the temperature
pretty<00:06:17.379> significantly<00:06:17.949> in<00:06:18.159> a<00:06:18.280> little<00:06:18.520> over<00:06:18.729> an

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
pretty significantly in a little over an

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.180 
pretty significantly in a little over an
hour<00:06:19.199> not<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:20.349> mention<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.740> noise<00:06:21.419> so<00:06:23.190> alright

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
hour not to mention the noise so alright

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.950 
hour not to mention the noise so alright
guys<00:06:24.460> that's<00:06:24.759> basically<00:06:25.300> what<00:06:25.569> I<00:06:25.630> wanted<00:06:25.840> to

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
guys that's basically what I wanted to

comparison video if you all have any

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.700 
comparison video if you all have any
questions<00:06:30.340> about<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.659> mag<00:06:31.870> dry<00:06:32.139> I<00:06:32.380> mean<00:06:32.590> the

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
questions about the mag dry I mean the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.879 
questions about the mag dry I mean the
mag<00:06:32.889> rad<00:06:33.069> pumps<00:06:33.550> or<00:06:34.539> the<00:06:34.690> DC<00:06:34.900> pumps<00:06:35.590> you<00:06:35.800> know

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
mag rad pumps or the DC pumps you know

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.499 
mag rad pumps or the DC pumps you know
which<00:06:36.099> who<00:06:36.430> makes<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.789> DC<00:06:37.090> phones<00:06:37.270> whatever

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
which who makes the DC phones whatever

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.350 
which who makes the DC phones whatever
questions<00:06:37.900> you<00:06:37.960> have<00:06:38.020> just<00:06:38.469> feel<00:06:38.650> free<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:38.889> ask

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
questions you have just feel free to ask

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.120 
questions you have just feel free to ask
I<00:06:40.360> really<00:06:41.050> think<00:06:41.229> it's<00:06:41.380> worth<00:06:41.440> it<00:06:41.800> for<00:06:41.949> people

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
I really think it's worth it for people

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.899 
I really think it's worth it for people
to<00:06:42.310> use<00:06:42.490> DC<00:06:42.819> pumps<00:06:43.389> over<00:06:43.599> regular<00:06:44.560> pumps<00:06:44.919> for

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
to use DC pumps over regular pumps for

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.080 
to use DC pumps over regular pumps for
the<00:06:46.029> heat<00:06:46.240> reduction<00:06:47.430> if<00:06:48.430> it's<00:06:48.669> an<00:06:48.789> external

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
the heat reduction if it's an external

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.600 
the heat reduction if it's an external
pump<00:06:49.419> and<00:06:49.750> the<00:06:50.319> power<00:06:50.560> savings<00:06:51.130> just<00:06:51.490> in

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
pump and the power savings just in

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.820
