00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
in Whistler in Canada just launching the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.999 
in Whistler in Canada just launching the
new<00:00:03.090> specialized<00:00:03.780> demo<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.440> too<00:00:04.560> awesome<00:00:04.620> and

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
new specialized demo I'm too awesome and

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.829 
new specialized demo I'm too awesome and
I<00:00:05.100> mean<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.370> last<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:06.060> one<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.480> were<00:00:06.569> rotting

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
I mean the last the one we were rotting

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.660 
I mean the last the one we were rotting
earlier<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.589> aluminum<00:00:07.919> one<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> really

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
earlier the aluminum one is a really

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
earlier the aluminum one is a really
good<00:00:08.820> bike<00:00:09.000> as<00:00:09.150> well<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.630> think<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.230> actually

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
good bike as well I think it's actually

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.539 
good bike as well I think it's actually
for<00:00:10.860> sale<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:12.090> sell<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.780> quickly

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
for sale or going to sell really quickly

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.860 
for sale or going to sell really quickly
but<00:00:14.549> yeah<00:00:14.759> obviously<00:00:14.940> we're<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.599> trying<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
but yeah obviously we're just trying to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.609 
but yeah obviously we're just trying to
make<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.800> fastest<00:00:17.310> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.960> lightest<00:00:18.960> best

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
make the fastest kind of lightest best

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
make the fastest kind of lightest best
all-around<00:00:19.859> race<00:00:20.340> bike<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.910> could<00:00:21.090> make

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
all-around race bike that we could make

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
all-around race bike that we could make
so<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.070> we've<00:00:23.220> been

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
so this is a this is it we've been

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460 
so this is a this is it we've been
working<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> long<00:00:24.180> time<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:25.170> carried

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
working on it for a long time we carried

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.929 
working on it for a long time we carried
the<00:00:25.560> geometry<00:00:26.039> over<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> last<00:00:26.640> bike

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the geometry over from the last bike

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.220 
the geometry over from the last bike
that<00:00:27.180> we've<00:00:27.300> been<00:00:27.390> working<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.080> long

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that we've been working on for a long

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.349 
that we've been working on for a long
time<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.650> well<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.640> feel<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
time as well we feel like we kind of

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
time as well we feel like we kind of
nailed<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.199> try<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> mirror<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
nailed it so we just try to mirror that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880 
nailed it so we just try to mirror that
on<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.730> bike<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.180> much<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:33.890> with

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
on this bike as much as we could with

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.260 
on this bike as much as we could with
all<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> new<00:00:35.309> features<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> stuff<00:00:36.000> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
all the new features and stuff this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850 
all the new features and stuff this
one's<00:00:36.480> rings<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.079> yeah<00:00:37.320> man<00:00:37.530> we've<00:00:37.710> been

going into you know getting this bike

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
going into you know getting this bike
where<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.719> now<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> finished

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
where it is now and so the finished

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
where it is now and so the finished
product<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.120> excited<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
product we're really excited what do you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
product we're really excited what do you
think<00:00:46.469> about<00:00:46.559> few<00:00:46.829> bigger<00:00:47.010> rules<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.610> think

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
think about few bigger rules and I think

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.450 
think about few bigger rules and I think
it<00:00:48.030> everything<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.870> me<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:50.070> notice<00:00:50.190> any

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it everything for me I don't notice any

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
it everything for me I don't notice any
negatives<00:00:50.940> we've<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> geometry<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
negatives we've got the geometry in a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
negatives we've got the geometry in a
way<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.430> handles<00:00:53.940> better<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
way that it's it handles better it's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
way that it's it handles better it's
snappier<00:00:54.840> than<00:00:54.960> any<00:00:55.079> other<00:00:55.230> bike<00:00:55.440> I've<00:00:55.649> ridden

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
snappier than any other bike I've ridden

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
snappier than any other bike I've ridden
with<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> wheels<00:00:56.670> even<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.140> me<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> just

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
with the wheels even but for me it just

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
with the wheels even but for me it just
they<00:00:58.710> roll<00:00:58.949> faster<00:00:59.460> once<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
they roll faster once you get them up to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
they roll faster once you get them up to
speed<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.100> traction<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.670> have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
speed they got more traction you have

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
speed they got more traction you have
more<00:01:02.910> tire<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> ground<00:01:03.660> they're<00:01:04.559> bigger

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
more tire on the ground they're bigger

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370 
more tire on the ground they're bigger
so<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.369> roll<00:01:05.909> over<00:01:06.090> stuff<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.869> easier<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so they roll over stuff a lot easier you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
so they roll over stuff a lot easier you
know<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> stay<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> holes<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
know you stay out of the holes or out of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
know you stay out of the holes or out of
the<00:01:09.060> square<00:01:09.330> edges<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> rocks<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.260> lot

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the square edges and the rocks a lot

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.010 
the square edges and the rocks a lot
better<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> yeah<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.780> good

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
better so yeah for me just all good

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
better so yeah for me just all good
things<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.470> sits<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> bike<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> way

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
things it sits the bike up in a way

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.420 
things it sits the bike up in a way
that's<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> enjoy<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.280> feel

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that's kind of for me I enjoy it I feel

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.499

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
on it reminds me more with their bike

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
on it reminds me more with their bike
and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.299> go<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and you can kind of just go for it so

and you can kind of just go for it so
yeah<00:01:22.920> man<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.729> running<00:01:24.060> Fox<00:01:24.330> stuff<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
yeah man I'm running Fox stuff which is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.719 
yeah man I'm running Fox stuff which is
different<00:01:25.650> than<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.830> production<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.490> made<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
different than in production we made a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
different than in production we made a
few<00:01:27.030> different<00:01:27.360> changes<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:27.810> last<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
few different changes from last like to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.720 
few different changes from last like to
this<00:01:28.650> bike<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.549> tuning<00:01:30.000> wise

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
this bike just tuning wise

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.340 
this bike just tuning wise
and<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.270> think<00:01:31.330> we<00:01:31.540> went<00:01:31.720> up<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.930> spring<00:01:32.170> rate

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
and I think we went up a spring rate

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.840 
and I think we went up a spring rate
just<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.740> little<00:01:33.130> bit<00:01:33.250> yeah<00:01:33.550> it's<00:01:33.700> pretty

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
just a little bit yeah it's pretty

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.310 
just a little bit yeah it's pretty
similar<00:01:34.150> how<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:34.540> works<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:34.990> pretty<00:01:35.170> easy

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
similar how it works it's a pretty easy

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.530 
similar how it works it's a pretty easy
bike<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.830> set<00:01:36.070> up<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.370> dial<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.820> straight

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
bike to set up and dial and straight

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.880 
bike to set up and dial and straight
away<00:01:37.720> there's<00:01:37.930> nothing<00:01:38.020> really<00:01:38.590> complicated

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
away there's nothing really complicated

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.380 
away there's nothing really complicated
about<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.760> bike<00:01:39.940> kind<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.270> does

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
about if the bike kind of does

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.300 
about if the bike kind of does
everything<00:01:40.690> for<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.800> shocks<00:01:42.070> sort

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
everything for you and the shocks sort

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.980 
everything for you and the shocks sort
of<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.460> same<00:01:42.580> way<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.240> yeah<00:01:43.720> maybe

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
of the same way so it's yeah maybe

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.110 
of the same way so it's yeah maybe
setting<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.620> up<00:01:44.710> pretty<00:01:44.950> easy<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.370> me<00:01:45.430> you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
setting it up pretty easy for me you

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.610 
setting it up pretty easy for me you
gonna<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.390> running<00:01:46.660> out<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.020> bologna<00:01:47.410> other

we<00:01:52.750> had<00:01:52.870> that<00:01:52.900> one<00:01:53.200> little<00:01:53.380> issue<00:01:53.470> at<00:01:53.800> Leo<00:01:54.010> gang

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
we had that one little issue at Leo gang

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.670 
we had that one little issue at Leo gang
but<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:54.610> basically<00:01:54.970> just<00:01:55.060> uh<00:01:55.360> just<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.380> really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
but it's basically just uh just a really

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.500 
but it's basically just uh just a really
tight<00:01:56.920> kind<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.280> bull<00:01:57.520> turned<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.060> just<00:01:58.240> rolled

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
tight kind of bull turned I just rolled

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.200 
tight kind of bull turned I just rolled
the<00:01:58.630> rear<00:01:58.780> tire<00:01:59.050> off<00:01:59.290> I<00:02:00.100> hadn't<00:02:00.820> known<00:02:00.940> because

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the rear tire off I hadn't known because

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.340 
the rear tire off I hadn't known because
I<00:02:01.300> hadn't<00:02:01.570> really<00:02:01.750> been<00:02:01.780> running<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.230> this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
I hadn't really been running to this

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.020 
I hadn't really been running to this
that<00:02:02.590> long<00:02:02.800> before<00:02:02.980> that<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.670> hadn't<00:02:03.910> had

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that long before that and I hadn't had

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.430 
that long before that and I hadn't had
any<00:02:04.180> problems<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.810> haven't<00:02:05.140> had<00:02:05.260> any

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
any problems with it haven't had any

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.190 
any problems with it haven't had any
sense<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:06.910> uh<00:02:07.120> yeah<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:07.750> live<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.170> you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
sense so it's uh yeah I live and you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.690 
sense so it's uh yeah I live and you
learn<00:02:08.260> next<00:02:08.770> time<00:02:08.860> there's<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.100> tight<00:02:09.280> bolter

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
learn next time there's a tight bolter

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100 
learn next time there's a tight bolter
and<00:02:09.850> don't<00:02:10.030> hit<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.510> hard<00:02:10.540> if<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.080> don't

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and don't hit it so hard if you don't

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.130 
and don't hit it so hard if you don't
have<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> lot<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.770> air<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:11.950> there<00:02:12.040> your<00:02:12.220> tire

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
have a lot of air and there your tire

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220 
have a lot of air and there your tire
what<00:02:14.140> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> impression<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.310> running

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
what kind of impression you know running

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.950 
what kind of impression you know running
usually<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.320> think<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.650> 28<00:02:18.190> 32<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.720> kind<00:02:19.900> of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
usually I think like 28 32 it's kind of

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.320 
usually I think like 28 32 it's kind of
like<00:02:20.110> my<00:02:20.260> go-to<00:02:20.530> pressure<00:02:21.040> run<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> bit<00:02:22.000> stiff

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
like my go-to pressure run a bit stiff

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.510 
like my go-to pressure run a bit stiff
but<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.350> tracks<00:02:23.770> lately<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.400> been

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
but it's a the tracks lately it's been

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160 
but it's a the tracks lately it's been
really<00:02:24.700> rough<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.270> try<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.600> keep<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> pressure

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
really rough so try to keep the pressure

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.990 
really rough so try to keep the pressure
up<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.500> little<00:02:26.680> ways<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:28.120> yeah<00:02:28.270> just<00:02:28.780> me
