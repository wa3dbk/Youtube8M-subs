how<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.050> hair<00:00:25.590> dynamics<00:00:26.039> change<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.599> spins

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
how the hair dynamics change as it spins

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
how the hair dynamics change as it spins
the<00:00:28.560> airflow<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> disrupted<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.480> air

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the airflow is disrupted the air

pressure<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.380> balls<00:00:31.590> underside<00:00:32.460> suddenly

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
pressure on the balls underside suddenly

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.190 
pressure on the balls underside suddenly
drops<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.230> ball<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.090> force

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
drops this ball now will have a force

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
drops this ball now will have a force
downwards<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.739> its<00:00:38.670> flying<00:00:38.879> through<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> air

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
downwards as its flying through the air

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.190 
downwards as its flying through the air
so<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.530> classic<00:00:40.980> curveball

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
so this would be your classic curveball

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.750 
so this would be your classic curveball

different pitch it is the axis of spin
that<00:00:53.430> determines<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.270> type<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.510> pitch<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.050> is

that determines what type of pitch it is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
released with backspin you get an upward

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
go towards the left because of that then

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.850

what about the infamous rising fastball

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.719 
what about the infamous rising fastball
many<00:01:30.540> hitters<00:01:30.840> swear<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:32.070> fast<00:01:32.430> balls

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
many hitters swear that some fast balls

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.539 
many hitters swear that some fast balls
