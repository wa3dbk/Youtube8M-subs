comprehensive dry eye evaluation the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
comprehensive dry eye evaluation the
function<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> eye<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.980> very<00:00:53.160> dependent<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
function the eye is very dependent on to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.750 
function the eye is very dependent on to
your<00:00:54.449> production<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.250> we<00:00:56.250> believe<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
your production and we believe that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
your production and we believe that
there<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.000> basically<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.350> layers<00:00:58.590> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there are basically three layers so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
there are basically three layers so
there's<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.760> salty<00:01:00.629> portion<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.379> all

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
there's the salty portion that we all

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
there's the salty portion that we all
think<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> sad<00:01:03.300> movie

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
think about we when we see a sad movie

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.039 
think about we when we see a sad movie
we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.670> salty<00:01:05.670> portion<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> major

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
we have the salty portion the major

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
we have the salty portion the major
liquid<00:01:07.619> portion<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:09.119> there's<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
liquid portion and then there's the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.890 
liquid portion and then there's the
mucous<00:01:10.560> layer<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.460> also<00:01:12.090> performed<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
mucous layer that is also performed that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
mucous layer that is also performed that
is<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.260> produced<00:01:13.710> by<00:01:13.799> goblet<00:01:14.310> cells<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
is also produced by goblet cells and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.780 
is also produced by goblet cells and
then<00:01:15.630> there's<00:01:15.930> lastly<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
then there's lastly what we think is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.179 
then there's lastly what we think is
very<00:01:18.000> important<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.810> an<00:01:19.170> oily<00:01:19.650> lipid<00:01:20.009> layer

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
very important is an oily lipid layer

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
very important is an oily lipid layer
that<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.520> produced<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:21.390> glands<00:01:22.070> along<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that is produced by glands along the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
that is produced by glands along the
inner<00:01:23.549> margin<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> lid<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.080> right

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
inner margin of the lid just right

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
inner margin of the lid just right
behind<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.710> eyelashes<00:01:26.400> about<00:01:26.729> 30<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
behind the eyelashes about 30 on the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
behind the eyelashes about 30 on the
upper<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> lower<00:01:27.960> each<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.430> produce

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
upper and the lower each that produce

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.899 
upper and the lower each that produce
this<00:01:30.350> oily<00:01:31.350> layer<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.159> contributes<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this oily layer that contributes the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780 
this oily layer that contributes the
tear<00:01:33.119> film<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.930> lippy<00:01:34.590> flow<00:01:34.979> system<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
tear film this lippy flow system is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.390 
tear film this lippy flow system is
designed<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.130> basically<00:01:38.130> massage<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> unclog

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
designed to basically massage and unclog

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.480 
designed to basically massage and unclog
clogging<00:01:41.400> at<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.820> opening<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:42.960> glands

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
clogging at the opening of these glands

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.270 
clogging at the opening of these glands
for<00:01:44.490> patients<00:01:44.970> who<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.119> dry<00:01:45.479> eye<00:01:45.509> diseases

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
for patients who have dry eye diseases

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
for patients who have dry eye diseases
because<00:01:47.280> their<00:01:47.430> lipid<00:01:47.640> deficient<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.470> when

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
because their lipid deficient so when

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
because their lipid deficient so when
patients<00:01:49.860> come<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.430> us<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.360> evaluation

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
patients come to us for an evaluation

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.440 
patients come to us for an evaluation
usually<00:01:52.470> they're<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.790> new<00:01:54.149> dry<00:01:54.420> eye

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
usually they're not a new dry eye

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
usually they're not a new dry eye
patient<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.170> probably<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.619> seen<00:01:55.860> several

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
patient they probably have seen several

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
patient they probably have seen several
doctors<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:57.509> regionally<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
doctors here regionally around the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
doctors here regionally around the
country<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> comprehensive

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
country we will do a comprehensive

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
country we will do a comprehensive
evaluation<00:02:01.049> looking<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> major

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
evaluation looking for what the major

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.889 
evaluation looking for what the major
problem<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.759> basically<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.600> there

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
problem is basically we think that there

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
problem is basically we think that there
are<00:02:07.110> patients<00:02:07.950> who<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.310> close<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.729> eyes

blinking and of your eyes up close and
then<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.640> computer<00:04:05.160> uses<00:04:06.160> all<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.459> pixel

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
then the computer uses all the pixel

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.840 
then the computer uses all the pixel
data<00:04:07.060> from<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.840> determine<00:04:08.250> how<00:04:09.250> much<00:04:09.489> how

thick your tear film layer is from the
lipid<00:04:12.820> component<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:14.470> use<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.670> data<00:04:15.880> from<00:04:16.150> all

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
lipid component we use the data from all

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.880 
lipid component we use the data from all
three<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.720> determine<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> patient<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.650> a
