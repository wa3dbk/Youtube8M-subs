00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.560 
optimistic about these projects
potential<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:23.250> course<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.180> human

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
potential of course the human

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.740 
potential of course the human
consciousness<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.890> fundamentally

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
consciousness is it fundamentally

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
consciousness is it fundamentally
unpretty<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.860> both<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> those<00:01:29.250> snaps<00:01:29.579> were

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
unpretty so both of those snaps were

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.310 
unpretty so both of those snaps were
pretty<00:01:30.119> creepy<00:01:30.509> dude<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.869> don't<00:01:30.960> actually

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
pretty creepy dude and we don't actually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
pretty creepy dude and we don't actually
know<00:01:31.439> too<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.520> i<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.060> i

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
know too much about them but i think i

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.460 
know too much about them but i think i
can<00:01:33.270> give<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> guys<00:01:33.600> lowdown<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.439> i

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
can give you guys lowdown on what i

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
can give you guys lowdown on what i
personally<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.610> snapchats

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
personally think of these snapchats

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
personally think of these snapchats
means<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.500> step<00:01:37.619> has<00:01:37.860> something<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
means so the first step has something to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
means so the first step has something to
do<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.340> surgeons<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> eyes<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.390> feel

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
do with surgeons and eyes and I feel

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
do with surgeons and eyes and I feel
like<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.439> some<00:01:40.619> type<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.799> human<00:01:41.220> surgery<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
like it's some type of human surgery to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
like it's some type of human surgery to
turn<00:01:42.090> them<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> robot<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.500> something

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
turn them into like a robot or something

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
turn them into like a robot or something
like<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.549> second<00:01:44.939> snap<00:01:45.119> has<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
like that because the second snap has a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.499 
like that because the second snap has a
robot<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.829> let's<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.880> feel<00:01:48.479> like

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
robot it so let's be really feel like

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
robot it so let's be really feel like
this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.530> robot<00:01:50.189> warfare

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
this is going to be robot warfare

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
this is going to be robot warfare
whatever<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> fuck<00:01:51.450> ali-a<00:01:51.780> had<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
whatever the fuck ali-a had in this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.020 
whatever the fuck ali-a had in this
video<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.530> other<00:01:52.710> day<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.520> seems<00:01:53.909> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
video the other day it just seems like

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
video the other day it just seems like
it's<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.750> robot<00:01:55.140> base<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> I'll

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it's going to be all robot base and I'll

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.990 
it's going to be all robot base and I'll
actually<00:01:55.890> show<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> guys<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> little<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.729> more

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
on why I think this so I'm sure you guys

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
on why I think this so I'm sure you guys
sold<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> second<00:02:00.719> step<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.500> very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
sold in the second step it was very very

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
sold in the second step it was very very
creepy<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> guys<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.549> open<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.149> twice<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560

they posted saying microchip implants

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.960 
they posted saying microchip implants
are<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.750> 2014<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:11.160> stuff<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.520> already<00:02:11.700> going

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
everyone's going to be a robot and I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.630 
everyone's going to be a robot and I
feel<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.409> that's<00:02:25.920> too<00:02:26.159> far<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.430> feel

feel like that's that's too far I feel
like<00:02:26.700> they're<00:02:26.849> diving<00:02:27.060> into<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.480> futuristic

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
like they're diving into this futuristic

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.229 
like they're diving into this futuristic
stuff<00:02:28.200> way<00:02:28.439> too<00:02:28.470> much<00:02:28.799> that's<00:02:29.340> one<00:02:29.610> step<00:02:29.849> past

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
stuff way too much that's one step past

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.630 
stuff way too much that's one step past
EXO's<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.379> going<00:02:31.560> into<00:02:31.920> fully

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
EXO's and that's just going into fully

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.809 
EXO's and that's just going into fully
robots<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.599> really<00:02:34.349> ridiculous<00:02:34.760> let<00:02:35.760> me

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
robots which is really ridiculous let me

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.039 
robots which is really ridiculous let me
hear<00:02:35.909> what<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> guys<00:02:36.269> think<00:02:36.329> about<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.810> you

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
guys wanted to you know go to this

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.369 
guys wanted to you know go to this
futuristic<00:02:39.299> route<00:02:39.780> where<00:02:40.079> you<00:02:40.290> know

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
futuristic route where you know

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.410 
futuristic route where you know
everyone's<00:02:40.769> about<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.129> robots<00:02:41.489> or<00:02:41.760> would

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
everyone's about your robots or would

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.059 
everyone's about your robots or would
you<00:02:42.540> rather<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.989> know<00:02:43.109> have<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.439> go<00:02:43.590> backwards

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
you rather you know have it go backwards

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.619 
you rather you know have it go backwards
in<00:02:44.159> time<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.579> we<00:02:44.700> already<00:02:44.879> do<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.359> it's

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
in time but we already do know that it's

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.089 
in time but we already do know that it's
futuristic<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.379> really<00:02:46.709> don't<00:02:46.769> want<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> get

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
futuristic so I really don't want to get

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.530 
futuristic so I really don't want to get
into<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.340> too<00:02:47.519> much<00:02:47.549> because<00:02:47.819> honestly<00:02:48.329> it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
into that too much because honestly it's

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.599 
into that too much because honestly it's
