doing these of for pork butts they're
relatively<00:00:32.610> small<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> largest<00:00:33.809> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
relatively small I think the largest is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
relatively small I think the largest is
maybe<00:00:34.230> seven<00:00:34.620> pounds<00:00:34.980> smallest<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.850> six

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
maybe seven pounds smallest is about six

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
maybe seven pounds smallest is about six
pounds<00:00:36.710> should<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.860> pretty<00:00:38.219> quick<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.730> why

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
butts on and I was gonna try to put them

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
butts on and I was gonna try to put them
all<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> same<00:01:00.000> grade<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.719> once<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> got

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
all on the same grade but once I got

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
all on the same grade but once I got
going<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.280> looked<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.180> were

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going on and looked at how they were

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
going on and looked at how they were
gonna<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.539> configured<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.290> decided<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> go

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
gonna be configured I decided to go

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
gonna be configured I decided to go
ahead<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:05.970> double<00:01:06.630> double<00:01:07.170> layer<00:01:07.380> with

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
ahead and go double double layer with

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.609 
ahead and go double double layer with
the<00:01:07.740> smaller<00:01:08.130> butts<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.270> bottom<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the smaller butts on the bottom the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
the smaller butts on the bottom the
larger<00:01:10.979> butts<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> top<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.500> logic

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
larger butts on the top and my logic

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.999 
larger butts on the top and my logic
there<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.700> heat<00:01:15.439> should<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
there is that the heat should be it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.940 
there is that the heat should be it
should<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.430> warmer<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> dome<00:01:18.240> than<00:01:19.049> down

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
should be warmer in the dome than down

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
should be warmer in the dome than down
below<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.090> thinking

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
below so that's what I was thinking

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.480 
below so that's what I was thinking
there<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.770> I'm<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:22.979> letting<00:01:23.310> her

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there so right now I'm just letting her

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.590 
there so right now I'm just letting her
come<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> temperature

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
come up to temperature

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
come up to temperature
naturally<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:26.970> at

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
naturally I think I'm gonna do these at

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.969 
naturally I think I'm gonna do these at
250<00:01:28.020> today<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> you'll<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.479> my

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Stoker ready to go so as soon as she

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
Stoker ready to go so as soon as she
hits<00:01:34.860> temp<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.340> gonna<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.610> ahead<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> fire

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

hits temp I'm gonna go ahead and fire
and<00:01:37.049> turn<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.829> maintain<00:01:38.640> 250

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
and turn that on to maintain 250

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.330 
and turn that on to maintain 250
sometimes<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.710> come<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> temp

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sometimes I like to come up to temp

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
sometimes I like to come up to temp
naturally<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.210> times<00:01:42.479> I'll<00:01:43.259> let<00:01:43.530> Stoker<00:01:43.890> do

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
naturally other times I'll let Stoker do

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
naturally other times I'll let Stoker do

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
her warmed up to about 250 and she was
open<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:06.509> while<00:02:06.689> while<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.140> was

putting everything together so she

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
putting everything together so she
cooled<00:02:09.179> down<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> anyway<00:02:11.370> she's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
cooled down a little bit so anyway she's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.110 
cooled down a little bit so anyway she's
coming<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.849> up

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
coming back up

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.830 
coming back up

temp and here's what here's what she

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.460 
temp and here's what here's what she
looks<00:02:16.019> like<00:02:16.170> inside<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> pecans

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
looks like inside you can see the pecans

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.550 
looks like inside you can see the pecans
going<00:02:20.099> pretty<00:02:20.310> pretty<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.659> I've<00:02:22.409> got

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
going pretty pretty well and I've got

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.399 
going pretty pretty well and I've got
that<00:02:22.709> I'm<00:02:22.950> probing<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.870> top<00:02:25.080> roasts

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
that I'm probing one of the top roasts

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.979 
that I'm probing one of the top roasts
and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:25.709> one<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> bottom<00:02:26.250> ropes<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.590> oh

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
and then one of the bottom ropes and oh

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.979 
and then one of the bottom ropes and oh
man<00:02:30.989> if<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> guys<00:02:31.349> could<00:02:31.590> smell<00:02:31.769> this

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
man if you guys could smell this

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.180 
man if you guys could smell this
actually<00:02:33.989> that's<00:02:34.140> probably<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.560> bad<00:02:34.799> angle

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
actually that's probably a bad angle

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.830 
actually that's probably a bad angle
because<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.819> light<00:02:36.030> behind<00:02:36.420> me<00:02:36.569> let<00:02:36.750> me

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
because of the light behind me let me

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.259 
because of the light behind me let me
try<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.049> from<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.440> side<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:38.069> don't<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.180> if

ahead and tell you what it is

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.570 
ahead and tell you what it is
pits<00:04:01.230> two<00:04:01.470> forty<00:04:01.830> nine<00:04:01.860> eight<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.400> top

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
pits two forty nine eight one of the top

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.190 
pits two forty nine eight one of the top
butts<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.940> 175<00:04:06.690> three<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.540> bottom<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.020> is

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
butts is 175 three and the bottom but is

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.229 
butts is 175 three and the bottom but is
163<00:04:10.890> two<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:13.100> think<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.489> those<00:04:14.640> top<00:04:14.970> butts

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
163 two so I think that those top butts

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.509 
163 two so I think that those top butts
are<00:04:15.420> cooking<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.109> little<00:04:16.350> faster<00:04:16.919> but<00:04:17.280> I

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
are cooking a little faster but I

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.819 
are cooking a little faster but I
thought<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> size<00:04:18.540> would<00:04:18.810> compensate<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
thought the size would compensate and

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.550 
thought the size would compensate and
they'd<00:04:19.980> be<00:04:20.130> done<00:04:20.280> about<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.579> same<00:04:20.760> time<00:04:21.000> but

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
they'd be done about the same time but
