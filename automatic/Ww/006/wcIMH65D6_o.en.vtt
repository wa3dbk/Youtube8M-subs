movement<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.980> thought<00:02:26.190> why<00:02:26.400> I've<00:02:26.580> never

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
movement that we thought why I've never

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.940 
thought about it like that before that's
what's<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.100> much<00:02:29.160> fun<00:02:29.340> for<00:02:30.270> me<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:31.620> things

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
well I think you know a large part of it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.390 
well I think you know a large part of it
really<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.140> cast<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:41.860> pick<00:02:42.100> every

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
I'm not sure what's good or bad when it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.110 
I'm not sure what's good or bad when it
comes<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.140> flexing<00:04:22.650> how<00:04:23.280> many<00:04:23.490> places<00:04:23.970> your
