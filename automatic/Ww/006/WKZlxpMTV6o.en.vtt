00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
well we're back here at Tom's were

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.379 
well we're back here at Tom's were
getting<00:00:01.350> set<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> weld<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.639> rockers<00:00:03.030> first

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
getting set to weld in the rockers first

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.480 
getting set to weld in the rockers first
of<00:00:03.510> all<00:00:03.600> Tom<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:03.990> doing<00:00:04.259> today<00:00:04.380> great<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
of all Tom how you doing today great to

of all Tom how you doing today great to
see<00:00:05.670> ya<00:00:05.879> well<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.450> looks<00:00:06.660> like<00:00:06.750> glue<00:00:07.200> over<00:00:07.560> here

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
see ya well it looks like glue over here

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.080 
see ya well it looks like glue over here
that<00:00:07.890> you've<00:00:08.040> got<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.700> you're<00:00:08.880> holding

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
that you've got that you're holding

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.759 
that you've got that you're holding
these<00:00:09.330> rockers<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.410> that's<00:00:10.590> not

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
these rockers on with but that's not

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.499 
these rockers on with but that's not
exactly<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.120> called

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
exactly what that is is it it's called

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.020 
exactly what that is is it it's called
metal<00:00:13.320> adhesive<00:00:13.860> metal<00:00:14.160> ADIZ<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.700> two-part

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
metal adhesive metal ADIZ is a two-part

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
metal adhesive metal ADIZ is a two-part
acrylic<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
acrylic and this is the way that we do a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.130 
acrylic and this is the way that we do a
lot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.550> repairs<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> newer<00:00:18.270> cars<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
lot of repairs on the newer cars this is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
lot of repairs on the newer cars this is
a<00:00:19.289> system<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:19.859> implemented<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
a system that's implemented at the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
a system that's implemented at the
factory<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:22.289> trying<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> duplicate

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
factory and we're trying to duplicate

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
factory and we're trying to duplicate
that<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> reasons<00:00:24.570> why<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.840> do

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that and some of the reasons why we do

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
that and some of the reasons why we do
it<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.980> strength<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it on this is for strength right and for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
it on this is for strength right and for
a<00:00:27.359> corrosion<00:00:27.810> resistance<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.920> does<00:00:29.130> both

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
a corrosion resistance it does both

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.630 
a corrosion resistance it does both
it'll<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.210> increase<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.099> pull

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it'll actually increase the the pull

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
it'll actually increase the the pull
rate<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> weld<00:00:33.329> by<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:34.290> times<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:35.130> now

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
rate on the weld by two times right now

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
rate on the weld by two times right now
if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.570> were<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> weld<00:00:36.960> something<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.440> would

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
if you were to weld something it would

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.549 
if you were to weld something it would
take<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:38.420> 800<00:00:39.420> pounds<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.290> order<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
take you about 800 pounds in order to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
take you about 800 pounds in order to
pull<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> apart<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> use<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pull that apart but when you use this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
pull that apart but when you use this
and<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.440> weld<00:00:43.680> over<00:00:43.950> top<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.940> does

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and then weld over top of this what does

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
and then weld over top of this what does
that<00:00:45.090> change<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.600> increases<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> 2,000

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that change it increases it to 2,000

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
that change it increases it to 2,000
tons<00:00:47.280> per<00:00:47.460> square<00:00:47.489> inch<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:49.320> increase

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
tons per square inch so it does increase

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.709 
tons per square inch so it does increase
the<00:00:49.800> strength<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.250> quite<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> way

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the strength by quite a bit now the way

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
the strength by quite a bit now the way
this<00:00:51.870> works<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.559> we've<00:00:52.710> already<00:00:52.860> done<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this works and we've already done it to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.590 
this works and we've already done it to
this<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.730> don't<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> take<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> back

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this so we don't want to take that back

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.470 
this so we don't want to take that back
off<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.949> dispense<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.329> out

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
off but we dispense a little bit out

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
off but we dispense a little bit out
here<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:58.260> sure<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.160> part

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
here make sure that the two part

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
here make sure that the two part
components<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.660> swivel<00:01:01.050> together

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
components they kind of swivel together

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
components they kind of swivel together
in<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.280> mix<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.699> together

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
in here and right mix it all together

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.789 
in here and right mix it all together
and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.019> we'll<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.439> we'll<00:01:04.589> lay<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and then what we'll do is we'll lay a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
and then what we'll do is we'll lay a
tiny<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.880> bead<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.530> what<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.619> done<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
tiny little bead and what we done on the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.440 
tiny little bead and what we done on the
other<00:01:08.100> side<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.610> ran<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.420> down

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
other side is we ran it all the way down

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.859 
other side is we ran it all the way down
both<00:01:10.409> sides<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.720> tiny

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
both sides to do that just a little tiny

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.359 
both sides to do that just a little tiny
because<00:01:13.290> it'll<00:01:13.500> squish<00:01:13.710> together<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> all

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
because it'll squish together and all

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
because it'll squish together and all
that<00:01:14.400> stuff<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.850> ooze<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that stuff will ooze out of there right

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
that stuff will ooze out of there right
that's<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> need<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.310> got

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that's all you need right there it's got

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
that's all you need right there it's got
little<00:01:17.820> tiny<00:01:18.000> glass<00:01:18.390> balls<00:01:18.840> inside<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
little tiny glass balls inside of it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
little tiny glass balls inside of it
which<00:01:20.130> keeps<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:21.000> squishing<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
which keeps it from squishing all the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
which keeps it from squishing all the
glue<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.439> when<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> clamp<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
glue out when you when you clamp it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.249 
glue out when you when you clamp it
together<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.810> ahead<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
together so then you go ahead with that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.670 
together so then you go ahead with that
and<00:01:25.619> place<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.570> sort<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> fitted<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and place this in you sort of fitted it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
and place this in you sort of fitted it
up<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.549> clamped<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.509> right

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
up in there then clamped it that's right

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
up in there then clamped it that's right
and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.860> between<00:01:32.340> these

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and then now that this is between these

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
and then now that this is between these
two<00:01:32.909> parts<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> metal<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> next<00:01:34.320> step<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
two parts of the metal the next step is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.399 
two parts of the metal the next step is
to<00:01:35.159> weld<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.020> two

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to weld it but I see that we have two

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
to weld it but I see that we have two
different<00:01:37.530> types<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.040> welders<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.939> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
different types of welders here one of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
different types of welders here one of
which<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.780> double-sided<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
which is a double-sided will do that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
which is a double-sided will do that
we've<00:01:41.280> seen<00:01:41.610> before<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we've seen before that's right and this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
we've seen before that's right and this
is<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> single<00:01:43.470> sided<00:01:43.649> wheels<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.189> made<00:01:44.280> by<00:01:44.490> a
