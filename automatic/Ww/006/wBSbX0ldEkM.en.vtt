00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the map on foundry this time i was what

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.599 
the map on foundry this time i was what
you're<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.520> go

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you're going to do is you're going to go

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.540 
you're going to do is you're going to go
into<00:00:26.759> Forge<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.739> this<00:00:28.859> map<00:00:29.099> set<00:00:29.399> up

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
into Forge and I have this map set up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.869 
into Forge and I have this map set up
because<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.029> takes<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> while<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.759> when<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
because it takes a while it's when you

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.430 
because it takes a while it's when you
try<00:00:33.089> this<00:00:33.150> out<00:00:33.420> you'll<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.080> it<00:00:34.199> takes

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
try this out you'll see that it takes

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.890 
try this out you'll see that it takes
some<00:00:34.650> practice<00:00:35.390> might<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.540> lucky<00:00:36.629> on<00:00:36.780> your

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
some practice might get lucky on your

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.750 
some practice might get lucky on your
first<00:00:37.019> try<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.920> eventually<00:00:38.070> takes<00:00:38.519> some

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
first try but it eventually takes some

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
first try but it eventually takes some
practice<00:00:40.519> alright<00:00:41.519> so<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:41.970> is<00:00:42.180> when

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
practice alright so what you do is when

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.000 
practice alright so what you do is when
you<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.110> ports<00:00:43.409> mode<00:00:43.589> you're<00:00:43.769> gonna<00:00:43.890> make

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you go into ports mode you're gonna make

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
you go into ports mode you're gonna make
a<00:00:44.040> double<00:00:44.280> box<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:44.909> have<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.089> I<00:00:45.480> want<00:00:46.019> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a double box like I have here I want to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
a double box like I have here I want to
join<00:00:46.170> oh<00:00:46.409> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.339> you<00:00:47.400> have<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.640> perfectly

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
join oh and then you have to perfectly

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.540 
join oh and then you have to perfectly
position<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.750> machine<00:00:49.079> gun<00:00:49.289> turret<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.430> be

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
position a machine gun turret to be

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.240 
position a machine gun turret to be
level<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> part<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.620> hold<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
going to go into human mode and you come

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.340 
going to go into human mode and you come
over<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.600> next<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
over here next to it and get on it and a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
over here next to it and get on it and a
mall<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.820> your

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
mall all the way up and see how your

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.310 
mall all the way up and see how your
body<00:01:06.149> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> goes<00:01:06.539> out<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.810> window<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
body kind of goes out of the window and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.389 
body kind of goes out of the window and
then<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> forge<00:01:08.520> mode<00:01:08.789> and<00:01:10.250> you're<00:01:11.250> outside

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
then go in forge mode and you're outside

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
on the ground here some maps if you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
on the ground here some maps if you
stand<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.490> ground<00:01:17.729> you'll<00:01:18.000> die<00:01:18.179> but<00:01:18.869> if

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
stand on the ground you'll die but if

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.540 
stand on the ground you'll die but if
you<00:01:19.050> walk<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.410> too<00:01:19.590> far<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.070> you'll

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
you walk out too far this way you'll

all<00:01:46.840> right<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:47.229> that's<00:01:47.409> basically<00:01:47.619> how<00:01:47.920> you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
all right so that's basically how you

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.660 
all right so that's basically how you
get<00:01:48.340> out<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.590> map<00:01:50.740> or<00:01:50.950> boundary<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:52.539> uh<00:01:53.670> as

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
get out of the map or boundary so uh as

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.950 
get out of the map or boundary so uh as
much<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.450> see<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:59.580> this<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.509> way<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.930> world

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
much it see it this is the way the world

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:14.540 
much it see it this is the way the world
ends

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.000 

Oh
