00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
Dave and I've had a few long talks over

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
Dave and I've had a few long talks over
the<00:01:07.590> last<00:01:07.770> 18<00:01:08.159> months<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.670> probably

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the last 18 months and probably

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
the last 18 months and probably
especially<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.840> last<00:01:10.020> nine<00:01:10.229> months<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
especially the last nine months and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
especially the last nine months and
they're<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.400> always<00:01:11.549> fun<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.119> I'm<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
they're not always fun but I'm I think I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
they're not always fun but I'm I think I
can<00:01:13.650> definitely<00:01:13.830> learn<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> them

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
can definitely learn a lot out of them

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
can definitely learn a lot out of them
so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.600> keep<00:01:15.750> reminding<00:01:16.049> myself<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.680> are

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so I just keep reminding myself that are

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
so I just keep reminding myself that are
you<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.640> even<00:01:17.790> though<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.180> sometimes

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you know even though it's sometimes

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
you know even though it's sometimes
unpleasant<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> time<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
unpleasant at the time it's all for a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.570 
unpleasant at the time it's all for a
good<00:01:20.460> cause<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.970> yeah<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
good cause and yeah it's just the the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
good cause and yeah it's just the the
mental<00:01:23.939> strength<00:01:24.119> has<00:01:24.390> been<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> big<00:01:25.110> hurdle

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
mental strength has been a big hurdle

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.460 
mental strength has been a big hurdle
for<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.280> um<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.170> I've<00:01:28.170> got<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
for me but now it's um it's I've got it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.899 
for me but now it's um it's I've got it
under<00:01:28.530> control<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> lot

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
under control I think and it's a lot

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
under control I think and it's a lot
better<00:01:30.030> than<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> used<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.290> was

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
better than what it used to be is it was

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
better than what it used to be is it was
only<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.009> point<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.850> identify

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
only one point that you can identify

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.350 
only one point that you can identify
where<00:01:33.689> something<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.590> shifted<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.360> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
where something really shifted for you I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
where something really shifted for you I
