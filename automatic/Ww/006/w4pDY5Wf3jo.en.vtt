00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.220 
aware of that jagex is going to be
making<00:00:26.050> huge<00:00:27.050> amount<00:00:27.350> of<00:00:27.440> changes<00:00:27.920> in<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.580> EOC

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.270 
following Tuesday's update so yeah
that's<00:00:32.719> kind<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.079> cocked<00:00:33.440> up<00:00:33.559> my<00:00:33.710> plans<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:34.160> bit

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
that's kind of cocked up my plans a bit

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.009 
that's kind of cocked up my plans a bit
for<00:00:34.489> making<00:00:34.820> some<00:00:35.000> guys<00:00:35.239> because<00:00:35.749> I<00:00:35.780> don't

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
for making some guys because I don't

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.899 
for making some guys because I don't
really<00:00:36.079> want<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.620> release<00:00:37.010> any<00:00:37.249> guides<00:00:37.609> and

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
really want to release any guides and

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.459 
really want to release any guides and
then<00:00:38.059> find<00:00:38.570> out<00:00:38.809> that<00:00:39.050> they<00:00:39.260> will<00:00:39.440> be

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
then find out that they will be

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.700 
then find out that they will be
completely<00:00:40.039> useless<00:00:40.399> because<00:00:41.319> things<00:00:42.319> will

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
completely useless because things will

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.029 
completely useless because things will
be<00:00:42.859> changing<00:00:42.890> such<00:00:43.789> as<00:00:44.059> gear<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.039> abilities

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
be changing such as gear and abilities

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.489 
be changing such as gear and abilities
and<00:00:46.370> how<00:00:46.519> much<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:46.819> hit<00:00:46.999> and<00:00:47.359> so<00:00:47.629> on<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.050> I'm

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
and how much you hit and so on so I'm

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.380 
and how much you hit and so on so I'm
not<00:00:48.679> going<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.979> dwell<00:00:49.129> on<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.519> too<00:00:49.789> much<00:00:49.999> but

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
not going to dwell on that too much but

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.930 
not going to dwell on that too much but
it<00:00:50.569> just<00:00:50.600> goes<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.050> show<00:00:51.229> that<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.100> EOC<00:00:52.699> was

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
it just goes to show that the EOC was

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.719 
it just goes to show that the EOC was
not<00:00:53.239> ready<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:53.780> be<00:00:53.929> released<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.729> they

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
not ready to be released and they

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.309 
not ready to be released and they
basically<00:00:55.969> changed<00:00:56.539> in<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.749> whole<00:00:56.989> game

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
basically changed in the whole game

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.110 
basically changed in the whole game
again<00:00:57.710> which<00:00:57.979> is<00:00:58.190> kind<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.550> annoying<00:00:58.789> because

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
again which is kind of annoying because

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.139 
again which is kind of annoying because
we<00:00:59.449> just<00:00:59.719> kind<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.170> got<00:01:00.379> used<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.010> EOC<00:01:01.519> but

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
we just kind of got used to the EOC but

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.170 
we just kind of got used to the EOC but
anyway<00:01:02.690> that's<00:01:02.929> why<00:01:03.350> I'm<00:01:03.739> not<00:01:04.580> going<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.059> be

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
anyway that's why I'm not going to be

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.300 
anyway that's why I'm not going to be
making<00:01:05.330> any<00:01:05.600> guide<00:01:05.870> right<00:01:06.200> now<00:01:06.440> until<00:01:06.710> this

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
making any guide right now until this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.280 
making any guide right now until this

you<00:01:59.300> haven't<00:01:59.690> seen<00:01:59.870> it<00:01:59.930> or<00:02:00.310> put<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> link<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
you haven't seen it or put a link in the

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.149 
you haven't seen it or put a link in the
description<00:02:02.450> or<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.170> screen<00:02:03.470> right<00:02:03.500> now<00:02:03.770> I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
description or on the screen right now I

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.390 
description or on the screen right now I
really<00:02:05.120> actually<00:02:05.510> like<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.260> armor<00:02:06.740> because

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
really actually like this armor because

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790 
really actually like this armor because
it<00:02:08.179> allows<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:09.019> switch<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.530> helm

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
it allows you just to switch the helm

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.010 
it allows you just to switch the helm
and<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.459> gives<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.849> really<00:02:11.060> good<00:02:11.300> bonus<00:02:11.780> in

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and it gives you really good bonus in

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.710 
and it gives you really good bonus in
each<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> different<00:02:13.100> combat<00:02:13.610> style<00:02:13.970> it's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
each of the different combat style it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.850 
each of the different combat style it's
basically<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.230> same<00:02:15.500> as<00:02:15.560> void<00:02:15.980> apart

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
basically the same as void apart

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.010 
basically the same as void apart
it<00:02:17.550> gives<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.910> more<00:02:18.120> defense<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.870> Life

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it gives you more defense and Life

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.180 
it gives you more defense and Life
Points<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.480> haven't<00:02:21.480> tried<00:02:22.080> void<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
Points so I haven't tried void because I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.100 
Points so I haven't tried void because I
only<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> Helms<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.930> never

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
only have one of the Helms I never

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.260 
only have one of the Helms I never
bothered<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.530> get<00:02:25.740> all<00:02:25.950> three<00:02:26.310> Helms<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.030> yeah

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
bothered to get all three Helms but yeah

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.240 
bothered to get all three Helms but yeah
I'm<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> talk<00:02:28.560> much<00:02:28.950> about

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
I'm not really going to talk much about

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.610 
I'm not really going to talk much about
the<00:02:29.580> kiln<00:02:29.850> because<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.750> don't<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.230> know<00:02:31.590> how

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the kiln because I don't really know how

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.580 
the kiln because I don't really know how
much<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.610> change<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.390> Tuesday<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.530> i

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
much it will change on Tuesday but i

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.740 
much it will change on Tuesday but i
will<00:02:34.950> make<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.490> guide<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> future<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
will make a guide in the future on it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.710 
will make a guide in the future on it
after<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.830> Tuesday's<00:02:38.430> update<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.420> yeah<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
after the Tuesday's update so yeah I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.230 
after the Tuesday's update so yeah I
think<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> kiln

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
think if you really want to do the kiln

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.660 
think if you really want to do the kiln
then<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.290> biggest<00:02:43.500> tip<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.070> give<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.610> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
just to know what ways will come up

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.790 
just to know what ways will come up
because<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.900> helpful<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> know

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
because it's really helpful just to know

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
because it's really helpful just to know
what<00:02:50.010> you'll<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.370> against<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> next

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.449 
what you'll be up against in the next
wave<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.110> plan<00:02:52.350> where<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.830> stand<00:02:53.100> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
stuff but if you're not sure what ways

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.440 
stuff but if you're not sure what ways
will<00:02:55.650> come<00:02:55.800> up<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:56.670> sure<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> type

let's<00:03:30.330> just<00:03:30.420> see<00:03:30.660> if<00:03:30.690> we<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:31.080> try<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.410> work

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
let's just see if we can try and work

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.160 
let's just see if we can try and work
this<00:03:31.590> out<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.610> butterflies<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.660> think<00:03:34.049> he

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
this out but the butterflies I think he

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.100 
this out but the butterflies I think he
relates<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.680> gothics<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.850> gothics<00:03:36.630> enter

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
relates to gothics because gothics enter

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.850 
relates to gothics because gothics enter
Gillan<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> butterfly<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.530> gothics<00:03:40.530> must

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
Gillan or as a butterfly so gothics must

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.890 
Gillan or as a butterfly so gothics must
be<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.310> rare<00:03:41.489> butterfly<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.510> they<00:03:42.690> talk

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
be the rare butterfly that they talk

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.289 
be the rare butterfly that they talk
about<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:44.580> know<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.940> could<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
about here I don't know if it could be a

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.780 
about here I don't know if it could be a
new<00:03:45.660> boss<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.320> could<00:03:46.500> be<00:03:46.620> interesting<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
new boss that could be interesting but I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.580 
new boss that could be interesting but I
think<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.780> do<00:03:48.900> with<00:03:49.080> gothics

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
think it's something to do with gothics
