00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 i 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.719
 ah 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 good 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350
 here 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.330
 I was not playing in the championship 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.820
 has gone wrong on the tour and every game 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.710
 I was playing better and grabbing more rhythm 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.630
 and now good I ended up playing very well 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.610
 I played much more loose in truth the 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.250
 last week made me very well 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.290
 rest and train hard at 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.080
 extraordinary in some training and 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.170
 nothing helped me very much they helped me with the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.880
 wild-card to the second future of girl and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.800
 I continue to dance there has been like that of 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.080
 one of the future good to do the best 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.510
 possible I come playing very well and nothing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.970
 try to do the best that really a 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.960
 impeccable match he did not commit any 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.210
 mistake and played very tucked was very 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.500
 obviously concentrated most of 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.869
 the points that networks earn because 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.790
 he marked the pressure and when he unbalances 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.830
 the rival this one had the opportunity to 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.810
 determine the points so he did pulled out 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.119
 very well that is today are not that day the ex 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 Colo says where there really are few 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.390
 mistakes and they are that since one plays well 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.880
 and feels that he plays well I just spoke 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.440
 with him and he told me that I certainly play 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.729
 very well has a nice rhythm of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.500
 competition and hopefully continue to evolve 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.910
 like this evolution so far the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.230
 true that for us it has been a 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.780
 I like to have received everyone 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.580
 and that show us which is the real 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.860
 level of tennis that is played at the level 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.630
 South American and also with some 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.660
 nuances of European numbers and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.960
 Americans for us is the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.180
 third edition that is made of the tours 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.870
 expensive of our club and at the same 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.030
 time has been a challenge because no 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.490
 we have set a goal to improve year by year 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.980
 both at the organizational level and at the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.080
 also from the tennis courts I 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.590
 I thank the tennis federation of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.110
 Chile for your support because the truth that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 without them we would not have been able and this one 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.760
 team work in conjunction with the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.100
