cocoa<00:03:45.210> powder<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.100> I'd<00:03:47.100> actually<00:03:47.250> did<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:47.550> my

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
cocoa powder and I'd actually did it my

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.130 
cocoa powder and I'd actually did it my
blender<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> almost<00:03:48.300> kill<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> blender<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.050> if

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
blender I almost kill the blender so if

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.390 
blender I almost kill the blender so if
you<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.350> food<00:03:49.590> processor<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> think<00:03:50.310> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
you have a food processor I think that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.310 
you have a food processor I think that
would<00:03:50.490> be<00:03:50.610> better<00:03:50.780> but<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> makes<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.140> like

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
would be better but it makes this like

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.870 
would be better but it makes this like
really<00:03:52.560> sticky<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.950> dough<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.640> then<00:03:56.760> I

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
really sticky like dough and then I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.530 
really sticky like dough and then I
stirred<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.630> rolled<00:03:58.560> oats<00:03:59.000> to<00:04:00.000> kind<00:04:00.210> of<00:04:00.270> bring

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
stirred in rolled oats to kind of bring

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.570 
stirred in rolled oats to kind of bring
it<00:04:00.570> all<00:04:00.690> together<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.200> make<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.380> dryer<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:02.460> I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.180
