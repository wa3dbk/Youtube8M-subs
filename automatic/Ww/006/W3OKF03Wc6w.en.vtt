testing the Bluetooth on the phone hi hi
I'm<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> go<00:02:34.390> ahead<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.720> hang<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.020> on<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
now okay all right bye-bye

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.880 
now okay all right bye-bye
so<00:02:40.570> that's<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:40.990> way<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.170> dial<00:02:41.470> now<00:02:41.680> perhaps

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
so that's one way to dial now perhaps

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.500 
so that's one way to dial now perhaps
that's<00:02:42.280> not<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> smartest<00:02:43.000> way<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.210> go

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
that's not the smartest way to go

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.450 
that's not the smartest way to go
because<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.200> you're<00:02:44.560> driving<00:02:45.040> down<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.280> road

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
because if you're driving down the road

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.780 
because if you're driving down the road
and<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.740> dial<00:02:48.010> you're<00:02:48.370> probably<00:02:48.580> not

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and you need to dial you're probably not

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.640 
and you need to dial you're probably not
keeping<00:02:49.120> your<00:02:49.240> eyes<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.780> road<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.500> what
