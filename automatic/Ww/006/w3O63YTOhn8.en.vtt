00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
quite a simple process this is a gem to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.970 
quite a simple process this is a gem to
drive<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:11.269> Alfa<00:00:12.269> ones<00:00:12.509> mr<00:00:13.080> czars<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.559> MC

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
drive but the Alfa ones mr czars and MC

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.980 
drive but the Alfa ones mr czars and MC
ones<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.519> exactly<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.120> same<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.960> can

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
ones are all exactly the same we can

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.720 
ones are all exactly the same we can
pick<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.590> Gen<00:00:16.800> 2<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.550> got

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
pick that it's a Gen 2 because it's got

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.779 
pick that it's a Gen 2 because it's got
the<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.800> bolts<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> nuts<00:00:20.039> holding<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> two

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the the bolts and nuts holding the two

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
the the bolts and nuts holding the two
halves<00:00:21.029> together<00:00:21.240> rather<00:00:21.689> than<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
halves together rather than just a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
halves together rather than just a
couple<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.010> studs<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.689> these<00:00:24.689> points<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:26.090> but

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
couple of studs on these points here but

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.330 
couple of studs on these points here but
other<00:00:27.359> than<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.740> removal<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> leg<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
other than that removal of the leg is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.799 
other than that removal of the leg is
exactly<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> same<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> earlier<00:00:31.710> and

to the front of the drive and we remove

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.240 
to the front of the drive and we remove
the<00:00:53.489> speedo<00:00:54.620> connector<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the speedo connector which is just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.360 
the speedo connector which is just
simple<00:00:56.610> push-button<00:00:57.350> pops<00:00:58.350> off<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
simple push-button pops off there it is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.200

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
there see that that's disconnected and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:16.610 
there see that that's disconnected and
then<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.809> trim<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> drive<00:01:04.409> down
