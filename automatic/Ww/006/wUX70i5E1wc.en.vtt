00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
the handyman with a Tesla coil now this

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.860 
the handyman with a Tesla coil now this
one<00:00:07.670> I<00:00:08.809> suggest<00:00:10.040> damaging<00:00:11.040> them<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.309> close<00:00:11.870> to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
one I suggest damaging them as close to

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.670 
one I suggest damaging them as close to
death<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:13.799> possible<00:00:14.790> because<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.080> Tesla<00:00:16.410> coil

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
death as possible because the Tesla coil

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.189 
death as possible because the Tesla coil
is<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.460> shock<00:00:17.760> jockey<00:00:18.029> essentially<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
is a shock jockey essentially and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.140 
is a shock jockey essentially and
they're<00:00:19.859> resistant<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> shock<00:00:20.550> jockey<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.060> if

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
they're resistant the shock jockey so if

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.599 
they're resistant the shock jockey so if
you<00:00:21.270> tie<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.570> around<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.410> circles<00:00:22.859> you're

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you tie them around in circles you're
