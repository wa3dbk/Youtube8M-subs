00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.910 
a screwdriver and we're unable to get it
out<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:17.280> these<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.790> need<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:19.020> hand

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
out so really these just need to be hand

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
out so really these just need to be hand
tightened<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:20.970> need<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> be

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
tightened down they don't need to be
cranked<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> once<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.670> undone<00:01:25.640> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cranked so once you get them undone you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.020 
cranked so once you get them undone you
just<00:01:26.909> slide<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> card<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.900> there<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.079> is

if you're having issues with some of the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
if you're having issues with some of the
slots<00:01:50.450> usually<00:01:51.450> you'll<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
slots usually you'll just have this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.600 
slots usually you'll just have this
metal<00:01:52.560> plate<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.390> which<00:01:54.390> I'll<00:01:54.570> take<00:01:54.810> off

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
metal plate here which I'll take off
