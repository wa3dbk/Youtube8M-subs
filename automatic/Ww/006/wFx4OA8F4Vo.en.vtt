around<00:00:34.720> my<00:00:34.990> Gran<00:00:35.200> Turismo<00:00:35.440> which<00:00:35.770> is<00:00:35.920> kind<00:00:36.100> of

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
around my Gran Turismo which is kind of

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.049 
around my Gran Turismo which is kind of
a<00:00:36.280> more<00:00:36.969> advanced<00:00:37.450> car<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:38.020> drift<00:00:38.260> with<00:00:38.440> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
a more advanced car to drift with so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.430 
a more advanced car to drift with so
it's<00:00:40.059> all<00:00:40.270> because<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.719> red<00:00:40.870> wheels<00:00:41.110> you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
it's all because of the red wheels you

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's all because of the red wheels you
know<00:00:41.500> red<00:00:42.039> wheels<00:00:42.280> that's<00:00:42.520> what<00:00:42.700> I<00:00:42.879> mean<00:00:43.210> wait

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
know red wheels that's what I mean wait

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.569 
know red wheels that's what I mean wait
I<00:00:43.600> mean<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:43.809> mean<00:00:43.960> if<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.469> had<00:00:44.649> to<00:00:44.680> stock<00:00:45.100> ramps<00:00:45.489> I

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
I mean I mean if I had to stock ramps I

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.400 
I mean I mean if I had to stock ramps I
mean<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.820> would<00:00:45.910> be<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.000> really<00:00:46.180> basic<00:00:46.390> use<00:00:47.050> but

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
mean it would be a really basic use but

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.010 
mean it would be a really basic use but
you<00:00:47.620> know<00:00:47.739> well<00:00:48.489> but<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:51.000> first<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.750> want<00:00:52.960> to

from<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.830> dealership<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.550> beasts<00:01:48.700> and

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
from the dealership to the beasts and

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.570 
from the dealership to the beasts and
dealership<00:01:49.390> office<00:01:49.810> start<00:01:50.400> they're<00:01:51.400> just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
dealership office start they're just

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.430 
dealership office start they're just
they're<00:01:51.760> just<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.000> most<00:01:52.120> basic<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.750> easiest

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
they're just the most basic and easiest

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.160 
they're just the most basic and easiest
to<00:01:53.590> drift<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.780> once<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.830> get<00:01:57.010> those<00:01:58.170> basic

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
to drift and so once you get those basic

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.720 
to drift and so once you get those basic
tuning<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.830> want<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.190> your<00:02:00.280> car<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.700> to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
tuning is you want to get your car up to

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.650 
tuning is you want to get your car up to
at<00:02:01.000> least<00:02:01.180> I'd<00:02:02.220> say<00:02:03.220> at<00:02:03.370> least<00:02:03.400> 400<00:02:04.270> horsepower

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
at least I'd say at least 400 horsepower

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.960 
at least I'd say at least 400 horsepower
you<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.050> go<00:02:05.170> off<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> 600<00:02:06.370> if<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.550> want<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.910> I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
you can go off the 600 if you want and I

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.219 
you can go off the 600 if you want and I
mean<00:02:07.180> if<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.420> go<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.660> if<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:07.990> go<00:02:08.050> any<00:02:08.200> higher

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
mean if you go in if you go any higher

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.339 
mean if you go in if you go any higher
than<00:02:08.560> that

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
than that

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.819 
than that
I<00:02:09.459> mean<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:10.700> not<00:02:10.819> really<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.900> yeah<00:02:12.140> after

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
I mean it's not really you yeah after

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.410 
I mean it's not really you yeah after
about<00:02:13.010> six<00:02:13.310> hundred<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.849> pretty<00:02:14.060> pointless

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
about six hundred it's pretty pointless

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.179 
about six hundred it's pretty pointless
but<00:02:14.659> if<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:14.930> under<00:02:15.079> 400<00:02:15.739> unless<00:02:16.010> you're

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
but if you're under 400 unless you're

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.860 
but if you're under 400 unless you're
under<00:02:16.310> thousand<00:02:16.849> kilograms<00:02:17.120> your<00:02:17.480> car<00:02:17.719> will

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
under thousand kilograms your car will

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.199 
under thousand kilograms your car will
be<00:02:17.930> struggling<00:02:18.469> to<00:02:18.530> redline<00:02:18.829> yeah<00:02:19.400> no<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
be struggling to redline yeah no and the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.000 
be struggling to redline yeah no and the
way<00:02:20.329> that<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.659> make<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.049> best<00:02:21.260> drifts<00:02:21.829> is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
way that you make your best drifts is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.949 
way that you make your best drifts is
redlining<00:02:22.519> obviously<00:02:23.090> which<00:02:23.299> whatever<00:02:23.480> does

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
redlining obviously which whatever does

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.349 
redlining obviously which whatever does
but<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.500> usually<00:02:25.159> don't<00:02:25.340> read<00:02:25.549> line<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:26.120> yeah

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
basic practice and yeah practice you can

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.559 
basic practice and yeah practice you can
mess<00:03:19.340> around<00:03:19.459> sit<00:03:19.729> down<00:03:19.879> force<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.329> want<00:03:20.479> to

lower downforce you don't be sticking to

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.219 
lower downforce you don't be sticking to
the<00:03:22.370> road<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.849> it's<00:03:23.510> better<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.900> get<00:03:24.019> your

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:24.229

Oreos<00:05:08.920> aren't<00:05:09.160> bad<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.370> mean<00:05:09.610> they're<00:05:09.850> probably

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
Oreos aren't bad I mean they're probably

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.600 
Oreos aren't bad I mean they're probably
like<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.330> medium<00:05:10.780> high<00:05:11.170> level<00:05:11.980> difficulty<00:05:12.340> car

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
like a medium high level difficulty car

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.950 
like a medium high level difficulty car
to<00:05:12.730> drift<00:05:12.880> Eric<00:05:13.240> salmon<00:05:13.510> is<00:05:13.570> probably<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.840> high

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
to drift Eric salmon is probably a high

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.920 
to drift Eric salmon is probably a high
level<00:05:14.170> difficulty<00:05:14.740> I<00:05:15.670> think<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.540> best<00:05:16.660> car<00:05:16.870> to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
level difficulty I think the best car to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.080 
level difficulty I think the best car to
start<00:05:17.080> all<00:05:17.230> this<00:05:17.380> Esper<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.860> v8<00:05:18.250> so<00:05:18.460> high<00:05:18.610> level

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
start all this Esper a v8 so high level

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.850 
start all this Esper a v8 so high level
oh<00:05:19.120> yeah<00:05:19.570> that's<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:20.110> impossible<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.740> aim

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
oh yeah that's like impossible to aim

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.610 
oh yeah that's like impossible to aim
higher<00:05:21.100> oh<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:22.300> I've<00:05:22.420> just<00:05:22.660> about<00:05:22.990> mastery

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
higher oh but I've just about mastery

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.410 
higher oh but I've just about mastery
yeah<00:05:23.920> but<00:05:24.340> after<00:05:24.430> tuning<00:05:24.850> your<00:05:24.940> car<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.180> mean<00:05:25.390> I

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
yeah but after tuning your car I mean I

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.730 
yeah but after tuning your car I mean I
can't<00:05:26.080> really<00:05:26.140> tell<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.440> much<00:05:26.560> about

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
can't really tell you much about

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.950 
can't really tell you much about
drifting<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.430> do<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.700> for<00:05:27.820> yourself<00:05:28.180> basically

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
drifting I do it for yourself basically

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.440 
drifting I do it for yourself basically
when<00:05:29.440> you're<00:05:29.560> entering<00:05:29.890> a<00:05:30.010> corner<00:05:30.400> just<00:05:30.580> tap

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
when you're entering a corner just tap

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.180 
when you're entering a corner just tap
the<00:05:31.600> handbrake<00:05:32.020> real<00:05:32.230> quick<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.680> break<00:05:32.890> loose

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
the handbrake real quick to break loose

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.740 
the handbrake real quick to break loose
and<00:05:33.220> then<00:05:33.610> basically<00:05:34.060> from<00:05:34.210> there<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:34.630> just

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
and then basically from there you just

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.870 
and then basically from there you just
accelerate<00:05:35.410> really<00:05:35.770> hardcore<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.280> just<00:05:36.700> get

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
accelerate really hardcore and just get

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.340 
accelerate really hardcore and just get
that<00:05:37.000> drift<00:05:37.360> going<00:05:37.630> through<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.870> corner<00:05:38.260> and

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
that drift going through the corner and

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.440 
that drift going through the corner and
you<00:05:39.010> have<00:05:39.100> to<00:05:39.160> be<00:05:39.250> colonised<00:05:39.700> this<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.210> nice

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
you have to be colonised this is a nice

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.450 
you have to be colonised this is a nice
drift<00:05:40.750> here<00:05:40.960> you're<00:05:41.140> right<00:05:41.440> beside<00:05:41.650> ya<00:05:42.220> and

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
drift here you're right beside ya and

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.070 
drift here you're right beside ya and
then<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:42.610> just<00:05:42.760> keep<00:05:42.880> just<00:05:43.240> keep<00:05:43.300> redirecting

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
then you just keep just keep redirecting

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.690 
then you just keep just keep redirecting
through<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.380> whole<00:05:44.860> corner<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.400> look<00:05:45.520> at

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
through the whole corner and look at

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.000 
through the whole corner and look at
like<00:05:45.970> this<00:05:46.120> great<00:05:46.390> new<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:47.500> front<00:05:47.770> people
