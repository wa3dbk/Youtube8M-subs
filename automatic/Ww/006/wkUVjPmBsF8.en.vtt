00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I like to revisit them because they're

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.420 
I like to revisit them because they're

an easy way to put my hair in a
protective<00:00:17.940> style<00:00:18.060> versus<00:00:19.220> do<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.430> two

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
protective style versus do it in two

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.010 
protective style versus do it in two
strand<00:00:20.880> twists<00:00:21.210> even<00:00:21.449> though<00:00:21.539> two<00:00:21.720> strand

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
strand twists even though two strand

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
strand twists even though two strand
twists<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.380> easy<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.920> real<00:00:23.400> tucking<00:00:23.699> pin

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
twists are easy a real tucking pin

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.429 
twists are easy a real tucking pin
usually<00:00:24.570> takes<00:00:24.840> about<00:00:25.410> ten<00:00:26.400> minutes<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
usually takes about ten minutes if that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.890 
usually takes about ten minutes if that
and<00:00:28.439> usually<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.029> couple<00:00:30.359> more

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and usually it's like a couple more

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.530 
and usually it's like a couple more
minutes<00:00:31.109> than<00:00:31.470> normal<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.239> securing<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
minutes than normal just securing the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.600 
minutes than normal just securing the
pins<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> different<00:00:34.680> areas<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> just

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
pins in the different areas so I just

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
pins in the different areas so I just
wanted<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> show<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> did<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.829> have<00:00:37.829> one

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
wanted to show you what I did I have one

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
wanted to show you what I did I have one
roll<00:00:38.719> here<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.620> goes<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.770> then

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
roll here that goes up to here and then

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
roll here that goes up to here and then
I<00:00:43.920> created<00:00:44.280> another<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.879> roll<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.930> which

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I created another little roll here which

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
I created another little roll here which
kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> makes<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> look<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:48.120> but

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
kind of makes it look like it's one but

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.819 
kind of makes it look like it's one but
it's<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.559> I'm

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it's really two and then in the back I'm

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's really two and then in the back I'm
gonna<00:00:53.070> try<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.570> roll

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
gonna try to show you I have a roll

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.480 
gonna try to show you I have a roll
coming<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.980> side<00:00:56.360> going<00:00:57.360> down

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.630 

and<00:01:06.580> then<00:01:07.270> over<00:01:07.630> here<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:08.290> made<00:01:08.740> like<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
and then over here I made like a the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.180 
and then over here I made like a the
role<00:01:09.850> that's<00:01:10.119> going<00:01:10.479> down<00:01:11.080> from<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:11.619> side<00:01:11.890> I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
role that's going down from this side I

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.410 
role that's going down from this side I
am<00:01:13.440> connected<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:15.280> little<00:01:15.760> tiny<00:01:16.060> role

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
am connected it to a little tiny role

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.499 
am connected it to a little tiny role
that's<00:01:17.110> connecting<00:01:17.890> into<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.610> first<00:01:19.030> main

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
that's connecting into this first main

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.530 
that's connecting into this first main
role<00:01:19.869> here<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.340> I'll<00:01:21.790> try<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.090> show<00:01:22.360> you<00:01:22.390> that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
role here so I'll try to show you that

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.280 
role here so I'll try to show you that
side

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
side

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.770 
side
so<00:01:23.500> altogether<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.280> about<00:01:24.490> four<00:01:24.820> rules<00:01:25.150> but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
so altogether it's about four rules but

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.740 
so altogether it's about four rules but
it<00:01:25.869> looks<00:01:26.080> like<00:01:26.229> it's<00:01:26.409> just<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:27.850> connecting

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
it looks like it's just two connecting

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:40.800 
it looks like it's just two connecting
all<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> way<00:01:29.229> around<00:01:37.560> okay<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.160> that's<00:01:40.090> what

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
all the way around okay so that's what

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.469 
all the way around okay so that's what
it<00:01:40.929> looks<00:01:41.140> like<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:43.000> said<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.330> took

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
it looks like and like I said it took

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.740 
it looks like and like I said it took
about<00:01:43.600> ten<00:01:43.960> minutes<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.600> just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
about ten minutes to do and you just

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.770 
about ten minutes to do and you just
have<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:46.960> secure<00:01:47.789> your<00:01:48.789> here<00:01:49.060> with<00:01:49.210> pins<00:01:49.539> all

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
have to secure your here with pins all

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.160 
have to secure your here with pins all
over<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:52.149> if<00:01:52.300> you<00:01:52.450> like<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.020> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
over I mean if you like it and you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.560 
over I mean if you like it and you
really<00:01:53.410> have<00:01:53.860> no<00:01:54.100> idea<00:01:54.429> how<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.910> do<00:01:55.149> it<00:01:55.179> then<00:01:55.450> I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
really have no idea how to do it then I

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.300 
really have no idea how to do it then I
guess<00:01:55.810> let<00:01:56.470> me<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.800> I'll<00:01:56.890> try<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.070> make<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
guess let me know and I'll try to make a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.230 
guess let me know and I'll try to make a
tutorial<00:01:57.460> but<00:01:58.800> it's<00:01:59.800> a<00:01:59.860> very<00:01:59.979> simple<00:02:00.280> style<00:02:00.550> so

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240
