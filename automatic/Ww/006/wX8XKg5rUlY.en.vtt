00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.580
 hello everyone today is a very special day 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.650
 for anonymous we have witnessed as the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.110
 imperialism takes away the freedom of 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.290
 expression hits us with his rod of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.419
 power and show us who's boss this time 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.700
 anonymous has been hit in a way 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.309
 cruel to witness an insult to the 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.829
 town or the biggest scam seen in 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.720
 the story not only took away our 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.690
 freedom of expression but also 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.790
 they robbed me I bring you a point of view 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.400
 that many will be with me and others will not 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.530
 they will do it because of this we suffer 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.060
 we all feel at university 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.250
 central east 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.560
 these data are real it was arrived at 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.320
 we for a student of that same 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.329
 first point institution is almost 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.030
 near the payment date and still not 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have taken class second point when 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.619
 you are going to pay those people from the window 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.780
 they speak badly offend you even if you're 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 paying your money and you always have to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.980
 make huge rows but what 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.990
 I think this semester will be faster 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.510
 since there will not be many students in the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.790
 university third point there is already almost 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.890
 have to pay the card and again but 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.020
 how is that I do not understand a card that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.270
 almost not used only works in the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.310
 locals outside and not everyone pick it up 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.250
 to make discounts I think they are 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.500
 with me in that part what weirdest 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.570
 encounter is that the central university 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.570
 from the east, we have to update 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.060
 using that card and sic and it does not make 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.310
 'will &amp; will work at your institution 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.410
 mediocrity that unfair them always 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.660
 they want to win they updated the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.970
 students to use that exam when still 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.280
 the locals are not aware of that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.619
 they always have a macabre idea against 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.170
 us to fuck and get us money 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.270
 I will not pay that card that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.820
 it's useless in san pedro de 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.619
 macorÃ­s and so expensive that they sell local and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.959
 that goes to all the students but 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.150
 thinking it well that for the rich I would 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.160
 they did their purpose and mission is just 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.100
 make money regardless of the other and what 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.410
 cheaper is an ice cream of 25 pesos but 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 we've already set a palpable example 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 let's evaluate these with other 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 university is the uasd in its center 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.110
 student sells the food for 5 pesos 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.510
 when we see a big difference and not 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
 because it's cheap the food is bad and in 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.740
 the eastern central university is going to 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.870
 buy a meal you have to walk with 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.270
 100 pesos to be able to eat you average 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.330
 pizza and a soda that are full and the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.340
 Basque 5 and 10 pesos with is better and so 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 they want the students not to go to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 buy outside the uc how is it possible 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.450
 that with such expensive price the student 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.730
 it degenerates into that student center 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.500
 ddie crazy that we are the best thing is to go and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 buy outside but the one that has to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.209
 shop at the student center but 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.830
 as most will be Dominicans now 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.170
 we will make them do in the center 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.660
 student is not that finding it there 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.910
 to be realistic but predicted a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.860
 heart of that center even if it does not pass 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.140
 but that will most likely happen because 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.880
 already the income is not the same for 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 the center gives me pity for those who 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.500
 they work there in that poor place of them 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.959
 but the institution benefits although 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.270
 they do not get anything he has to pay 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.850
 the same amount even if they do not sell it that 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.370
 big net is mafia with that big net I do not know 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.260
 and not buy my beloved and nowhere 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.750
 in most places you buy 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:43.520
 that does not work maybe 10 000 000 000 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.980
 000 000 000 1 etcetera work in a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.200
 place miraculously you believe that 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.850
 we are some fourth point assholes 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.650
 problem that affected thousands of 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.960
 students was the exams 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.390
 departmental thanks to a single 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.670
 person carlos sean and listen to him man 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.250
 again, Carlos is in charge of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.140
 those departmental exams is wrong 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 formula and have no foot or head 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.940
 although he says that just happens to 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.890
 computer and that the teachers are the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.870
 who give him the material but he 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.910
 It has a lot to do with the problems 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.890
 observe but now the good thing that 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.110
 many did not know is that we discovered 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.180
 recently when hacking your account is 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.980
 that the exam questions for 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.020
 he is complete and for the 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.360
 students appear in full that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.640
 problem rhythms in pharmacology though 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.920
 we are still investigating if to 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.750
 all the exams happened that same 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.610
 we are still investigating 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.010
 since many students were 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.680
 unjustly burned by those misdeeds 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.140
 and lack of ethics on their part but 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.060
 our purpose is not to criticize not only 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.430
 to the eastern central university 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.320
 we clarify things we are asked 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.990
 that we investigate and help the 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.270
 people so that others are not unfair 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.640
 another problem is the time they give in 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.620
 the exams is an hour and a half but 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.870
 the person in charge of these exams 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940
 forces students to finish before 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.470
 that the established time passes 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.350
 because he says that computers 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.600
 they run slower than the normal clock and 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.150
 students say they have calculated and the 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.920
 computer clock goes faster 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.840
 that the clock and normal and that he 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.970
 He spoke to the students who are studying 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.610
 those exams as if it was worth nothing 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.650
 but the biggest thing is that they pay their 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.780
 money to receive that kind of 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.790
 insults for that is that this country does not 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.130
 advances with these injustices 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.620
 another point talking about the exams is 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.570
 that many questions from those exams do not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.210
 unanswerable and students will 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.370
 they say to managers of those exams that 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.200
 we do and he says put any 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.110
 Rule 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.300
 and he never fixes anything and so he calls 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.160
 that prestigious institution with those 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.920
 holes it has and lack of clarity 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.260
 in that institution fifth point does 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.360
 almost a month the rector of the university 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.830
 had a meeting with the students of 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.200
 medicine to treat issues 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.690
 current tasks and talk about the 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.150
 federal loans in that meeting had 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.190
 Dominicans and foreigners fighting for 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.590
 his right the point is that he was going to 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.630
 deal with several issues and only the rector 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.600
 he talked about his institutions forcing himself 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.880
 of students who were affected 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.950
 and annoyed to pass not less than one 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.290
 hour he ordered the Americans removed from 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.150
 many audience came out some 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.550
 they listened but they left and the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.620
 Secretary of Medicine prevented the passage to 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.630
 Any Dominican who would like to enter 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.910
 to that place so that now the 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.400
 foreigners left many for their evil 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.530
 management and its lack of vigilance to its 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.600
 institution they were the ones that have 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.430
 the greens now we will do how to treat 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.800
 local students to the 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.110
 Dominicans after losing the majority 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.139
 of foreigners and if you watch this video 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.560
 let's hope there's 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.650
 to some change the knowledge is free 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:53.770
 we are anonymous we are legion no 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.770
 we forgive we do not forget wait for us
