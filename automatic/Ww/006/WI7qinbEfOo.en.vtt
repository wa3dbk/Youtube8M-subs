00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.810 
the only reason we're starting off with
white<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.530> because<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:08.920> want<00:01:09.130> our<00:01:09.280> background

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
white is because we want our background

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.320 
white is because we want our background
colors<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.149> be<00:01:10.450> darker<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:12.340> since<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.209> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330

shapes<00:02:29.599> don't<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.380> be<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.650> same<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.069> mean

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
shapes don't have to be the same I mean

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.089 
shapes don't have to be the same I mean
if<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.430> want<00:02:31.700> each<00:02:31.970> nail<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.780> same<00:02:33.099> you

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
if you want each nail to be the same you

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.890 
if you want each nail to be the same you
could<00:02:34.280> make<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.640> happen<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.329> it's<00:02:35.450> not

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
could make that happen but it's not

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.319 
could make that happen but it's not
necessary<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.099> all<00:02:37.310> I'm<00:02:37.459> doing<00:02:37.489> there<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.030> on

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
necessary so all I'm doing there is on

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.039 
necessary so all I'm doing there is on
the<00:02:38.450> two<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.870> Survey's<00:02:39.349> I'm<00:02:39.590> doing<00:02:40.040> um

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
the two little Survey's I'm doing um

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.620 
the two little Survey's I'm doing um
just<00:02:42.049> little<00:02:42.349> shapes<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:43.970> between<00:02:44.450> these

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
just little shapes so in between these

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.470 
just little shapes so in between these
two<00:02:44.900> little<00:02:45.260> leaf-like<00:02:46.220> shapes<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:46.730> made<00:02:46.970> I'm

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
two little leaf-like shapes I made I'm

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690 
two little leaf-like shapes I made I'm
going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.440> I'm<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.890> draw<00:02:49.459> a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
going to go in and I'm going to draw a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.440 
going to go in and I'm going to draw a
line<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.709> want<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.790> pretty<00:02:53.030> thick

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
line and you want to be pretty thick

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.319 
line and you want to be pretty thick
with<00:02:53.660> them<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.680> show<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.700> over<00:02:56.090> here

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
with them so they can show so over here

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.509 
with them so they can show so over here
we<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.660> draw<00:02:56.810> another<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.440> going<00:02:57.950> upward

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
we can draw another one going upward

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.140 
we can draw another one going upward
like<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.769> then<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.069> sides<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.760> mean

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
like that and then on the sides I mean

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.629 
like that and then on the sides I mean
this<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.359> such<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.750> super<00:03:03.230> easy<00:03:03.650> design<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.459> do

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
this is such a super easy design to do

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.789 
this is such a super easy design to do
and<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.810> could<00:03:05.959> just<00:03:06.170> shape<00:03:06.380> them<00:03:06.590> out

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
and you could just shape them out

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.770 
and you could just shape them out
whatever<00:03:07.100> way<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:07.670> want<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.239> that's<00:03:08.389> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
whatever way you want so that's the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.610 
whatever way you want so that's the
shape<00:03:09.440> we've<00:03:09.709> come<00:03:09.980> up<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:11.239> pretty<00:03:11.600> much<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
shape we've come up so pretty much that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.860 
shape we've come up so pretty much that
would<00:03:12.920> be<00:03:13.069> your<00:03:13.250> Bridal<00:03:13.670> design<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:14.630> very

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
would be your Bridal design so it's very

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.830 
would be your Bridal design so it's very
simple<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.620> do<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:16.519> looks<00:03:17.269> prettier<00:03:17.630> your

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
simple to do and it looks prettier your

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.020 
simple to do and it looks prettier your
nails<00:03:18.049> don't<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.650> super<00:03:19.030> ginormously

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
nails don't have to be super ginormously

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.569 
nails don't have to be super ginormously
long<00:03:20.389> so<00:03:21.019> that's<00:03:21.290> that's<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.310> bridal

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
long so that's that's it for the bridal

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.840 
long so that's that's it for the bridal
design<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.989> all<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.380> have<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:24.950> do<00:03:25.190> next<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.609> allow

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
design so all I have to do next is allow

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.180 
design so all I have to do next is allow
this<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.209> completely<00:03:26.660> dry<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.290> we're<00:03:28.100> gonna

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
this to completely dry and we're gonna

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.940 
this to completely dry and we're gonna
start<00:03:28.519> working<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.989> design<00:03:30.470> using<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
start working on this design using the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.730 
start working on this design using the
same<00:03:31.250> exact<00:03:31.639> technique

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.290 

so<00:03:35.740> now<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.580> worked<00:03:36.819> on<00:03:37.000> this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
so now that we have worked on this

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.880 
so now that we have worked on this
Bridal<00:03:37.870> design<00:03:38.230> we're<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.740> turning

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890

our Bridal design into this design which
is<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.620> same<00:03:41.950> exact<00:03:42.430> technique<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.510> only

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
is the same exact technique the only

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
thing you're going to have to do is

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.020 
thing you're going to have to do is
you're<00:03:44.920> going<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.250> choose<00:03:45.459> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
you're going to have to choose the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.640 
you're going to have to choose the
colors<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.569> your<00:03:46.660> choice<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.170> pretty<00:03:47.440> much
