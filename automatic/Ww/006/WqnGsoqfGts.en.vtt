00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.660
 Today we begin to build a major scale 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.120
 I will show you how to build 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.469
 major scale by what signs and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.990
 and where do diets come from and thought for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.020
 started explaining what tone pluton is to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 the piano is worn like it was already written above 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 who read the article there it says that pluto 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 this is the smallest distance between 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.619
 two keys here take let's say but 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.199
 this is home from being hit 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.910
 It seems like the keys are near but not for them 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.579
 forgive attention with you for eating them and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 Forces one key that is it is necessary to step on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.850
 halftones and black keys 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 it turns out that from hitting 2 semitones one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 and the second one is this 2 halftones this is already 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 tons so that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
 if we need a semitone then we build by the council 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.970
 key shape 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.340
 Here is semitone today on loot 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.930
 enter two closer keys 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.360
 the distance is not the smallest 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.720
 distance 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.730
 also a semitone here are two white keys 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.910
 near because there is no black between them 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.510
 here with a black halfton key here 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:28.090
 weather 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:30.100
 all jump here like on and one more 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.120
 semitone between two white keys 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.050
 note si food that is whether there is between 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.030
 keys no 3 keys here unity 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.869
 it means tons if instead of at least 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.660
 key 3 I confuse it sounds like a very 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.000
 abruptly now what concerns 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.280
 major scale 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 major scale as written already tons 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.490
 tons semitone-tons tons that semitone we take 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.490
 most favorite year in C major and watch 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.490
 tone squads house 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.490
 then semitone 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.830
 yes thornton 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.140
 detachments tone from metaphor pluto should 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.470
 be further triton 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.720
 ton ton ton 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.730
 Now I play slowly and once more 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.730
 Pay attention to where the tone Audrey Tautou 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.349
 one more tone 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.349
 half tone 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:47.450
 tone tone semitone this structure is a formula 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.909
 the same for all major scales if 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.609
 we will take someone to a friend and say 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.219
 G major here are still going to zhor and 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.260
 we will build from it according to this formula 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.620
 seen in men tone tone half tone 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.299
 toyton semitone build from tony salt 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.299
 roes have changed the key 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:19.680
 so 1 hub 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:26.240
 peppa god yes too tons bolt bye 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.120
 it turns out two houses then for the triton 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.620
 tons 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.019
 tons if we press the white key then 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.430
 will be a semitone at this stage we need 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.590
 tone so here's the place for this fa 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.500
 raise and play faris 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.340
 and between sadism and salt is semitone this 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:59.620
 tone is obtained 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:59.620
 not yet to put a 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.270
 so everything corresponds to the carriage pluto 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.420
 triton 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.629
 here itself is yellow 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.780
 the formula corresponds let's say we take 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.699
 let's do something else in F major too 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.710
 written somewhere there even have pictures 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.840
 here now we disassemble the door on the tuff we 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.020
 take it but I already said that tonic 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.580
 may be a different structure is the same 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:40.440
 but I'll show you to the fountain 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:43.210
 We build while he another tone correctly 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.639
 mean you on 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.569
 there he is and then we need to shout the formula 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.509
 semitone if we press the white key 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.069
 there will be no more major gamma it will be 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.500
 already another for soaring so that 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.830
 keep that formula we need this one 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.810
 That's all replaced by B flat why 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.659
 then the tone will match 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.810
 tone 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.960
 Here he is a mole reduced from B flat 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.360
 need tons but 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.630
 one more tone 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.560
 and last remember 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.560
 showing again 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:35.200
 seventh house is home then he 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.120
 well and finally I will show another gamma 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.250
 which I do not understand in the article where 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.670
 There are no pictures and let's take a hunchback 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:46.630
 let's say in A major 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:50.290
 then nicole and let's build 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:55.510
 major scale from for given our 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:58.230
 the formula and so and for building the sea ​​pro tone 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.570
 do not fit all the tons between them key 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:06.120
 not good because if you go on white 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.120
 will be semi. court number 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.100
 raise this note and then we get tons 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.780
 then we need a semitone goes obella 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.930
 the key gets the pluto while all 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.180
 matches we remember we need one more 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.570
 you need a tone on white 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.680
 because it will be semi languid on this 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.380
 Stage need tons tons another tone by 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:41.660
 white too 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:41.660
 play this and semitone for finished and 40 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:56.610
 tons tons 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.190
 semi volume that is, as you saw 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.410
 we all major scales can of course 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.200
 continue all but probably not 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.090
 meaning I thought it understood that the whole gamut 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.300
 obey all the openwork gamut 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.310
 obey the formula that we already 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.650
 repeatedly repeated about tons tons 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.650
 muton tons tons tons pluto 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.880
 we take any 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.180
 to protect in this way 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.970
 I already went through all the women 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:37.610
 let's correctly hot all build 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.570
 according to the same formula that's all for 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.570
 today's thanks
