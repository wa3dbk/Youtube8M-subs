00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 now everyone here seems to be a no 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.069
 video I come to bring you a tutorial that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.259
 a subscriber has asked me to come 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.630
 being like how to download and put 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.630
 our autorun a cable iso 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.790
 windows xp service pack 4 and well then 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 this guy asked us what good 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.029
 he also asked me to send him a greeting 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 so a greeting for Daniel Ortiz and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 well let's start now with this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 shit I'm in a hurry 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 first we are going to download the iso this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 is I'm going to leave the description weighs 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.830
 I think it weighs less than 500 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.800
 megas are 450 4 megabytes weighs very little 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.660
 follow me I think you can put in a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 pendrive of a gig and you will go 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 perfectly and we're going to need the iso 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 obviously and then the program ultra that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 as you already know for me the best of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.469
 better than there is or perfectly 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 we will open the program and well we give it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.040
 file open 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.560
 and then well we mark the iso in this 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.500
 case is this from here for me 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.090
 and we look here put auto bootable 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.140
 he is going to put autorun cable because it is the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.490
 I'm going to leave the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.520
 description but good always watch 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.520
 that team in bootable and good car 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.370
 once done that we put the usb and in the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.930
 usb port of the computer or good you 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.800
 We give auto boot record image of 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.450
 disk will ask us for permits we accept them 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.980
 and we're also here then, well, 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.750
 we select the usb that is in this 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.000
 case mine is this monkey that I have 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.490
 4gb post we selected that here 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.740
 you have selected and well we can already 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.650
 give to record voucher will then ask us 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.960
 format we accept that it will not be deleted 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.190
 everything we have in the usb and good 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 will begin to load so good then I 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.770
 I pass this and as soon as this is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.130
 I come back so far 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.990
 Well, since this is the end of everything 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.729
 it has not taken very little, you see 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.920
 it took two minutes four seconds and 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.590
 that little bit after here recording 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.009
 finished correctly because already already 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.560
 is now we can close everything and remove the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.549
 usb and we can install our 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 windows xp 64 is to say that the interface 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.410
 of windows xp service pack 4 is different 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.990
 to the other windows xp I think 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.820
 and well it's pretty cool so that 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.370
 is a good option if you want to put 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.100
 windows xp occupies little and good renders 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.500
 Renders perfectly performs like any 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.640
 windows xp so well then I hope that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.920
