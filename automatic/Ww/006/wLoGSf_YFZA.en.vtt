00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.660
 hi no i don't want to make controversy in 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.669
 this video I will not talk about the theater 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.909
 mobile chain nor its director 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:17.289
 lent beppe or unnamed dick 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.340
 porc 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.490
 I just want to talk to you a 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.670
 talk about my work in the 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.980
 exciting work you know there are days 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.039
 in which I wake up at 10 am 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.900
 and from 10 to 18 I own 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.420
 the impression of not fucking doing 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.700
 then from 6 pm to 11 pm they are really 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 aware of not doing shit and da 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.030
 23 to 10 sleep I sleep I repented 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.789
 to have undertaken this career 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.899
 bitterly regretted because I turn around 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.030
 around and I only see entities 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.260
 ectoplasmic wandering in search of 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 a pleasant place thirsty for exhibitionism 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.449
 no I'm not referring to the mobile theater of 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.570
 chain I think anyone had gods 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.369
 masters not all masters who have us 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.860
 taught everything good or bad 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 we know how to do today 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 here I think these are the masters 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.000
 they should have warned us a little earlier 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:27.729
 because the boys are as many as you are 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 you are a 25 20 30 a boys and I will 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:38.860
 advice from tomorrow everyone does not come more 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.869
 stay at home because why but me 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.329
 I have to say everything myself 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.509
 but why then do you an example 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.479
 here for example poor you suck six 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.299
 ugly to your teeth from outside where you want 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.200
 in short, go because she is there 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.320
 here you are a bitch and then you remind me 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 also someone and you here for example 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.570
 you could do something he created you know 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 It was the peak of yours 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.979
 career might be I know 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:16.380
 interpret the godot in waiting 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:18.330
 godot boys listen let go who it is 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.500
 been and you find yourself in a situation 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.720
 paradoxical to work while not having a 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.569
 work that is what you consider a 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 work for others is not work e 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.730
 for others I mean all those who 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.769
 don't do your job what you do 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.830
 believe it is work is not at work for the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.540
 family is not work for the public and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.560
 it is not work even for those who wear it 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.680
 power of attorney and work 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.799
 the producers then this joy is 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.090
 what the production offers you is not 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.090
 he understood excuse and there is a problem 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.420
 if a professional and soloists are 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.400
 those who do not take this 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 like a job you teach me yourself 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.290
 that true artists who just do 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.659
 remember they are the ones who don't 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.579
 with the passion that love brings us 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.889
 for art and now it is only passion and 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.849
 love for art can be measured by what 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:23.129
 150 euros I have not the hottest ossuary 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.780

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.810
 problem

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.419
 also because then to the many expenses no 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.150
 the machine from the mechanical gasoline 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.560
 bills the fines then look for a 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.430
 work that can give you stability 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 economic 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.139
 a secondary job even if you hope with 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.930
 all yourself becoming primary was 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.650
 the mandi curriculum francesco maria 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.650
 bastards 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.440
 He's sorry this guy has never worked 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.690
 in his life yes yes I say three pages of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.349
 curriculum three pages of shows are there 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.030
 this and therefore I have never worked 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.009
 I want to emphasize that up to this 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.139
 I never mentioned the theater 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.830
 chain manager me his director e 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.830
 peppe of Lent 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.449
 even if I just did it 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.639
 if I have to tell the truth I have finished 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.550
 all the insults you then think of one 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.280
 turning in your life you put yourself at 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.740
 teach you start teaching 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.330
 school box opened a school a course 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.870
 of acting diction movement 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 corporeal soccer course of the mime item 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.409
 French course of Randazzese dialect 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.310
 waits for the plant to be the rhombus course 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.310
 of acting moon 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.819
 and makes the same hypocritical mistakes 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:16.689
 of the same teachers as you were 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.329
 kid like you see the circle yes 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.989
 always closes the only negative note though 

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.559
 is in future generations that going 

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.559
 go on like this 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.869
 they will be increasingly lacking in ethical ideals 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.569
 and moral and artistic preparation 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:33.849
 so maybe for 25 years and you find yourself a 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.929
 imbecile who directs the mobile theater of 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.349
 chain or cup I'm told I do n't want to do 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:40.349
 controversy
