hasn't changed a whole lot
they<00:00:14.549> kept<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> basic<00:00:15.480> design<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.260> oh<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
I'll show you on the map exactly where

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.220 
I'll show you on the map exactly where
each<00:00:18.960> each<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:22.939> music<00:00:23.939> disc<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.140> can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
each each a music disc is so as you can

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.540 
each each a music disc is so as you can
see<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> coordinate<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
see right here this is the coordinate so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.189 
see right here this is the coordinate so
let's<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.150> open<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> map<00:00:27.660> perfect

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
let's do this also open the map perfect

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.589 
let's do this also open the map perfect
for<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> second<00:00:28.880> where<00:00:29.880> each<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> where<00:00:30.480> each

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
for a second where each it where each

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.780 
for a second where each it where each
one<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> I'll<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> chest<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.250> then

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
one is and I'll get the chest out then

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760 
one is and I'll get the chest out then
I'll<00:00:32.880> take<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.570> disc<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.079> I'll<00:00:34.530> keep<00:00:34.710> my

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I'll take out the disc and I'll keep my

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.229 
I'll take out the disc and I'll keep my
up<00:00:35.010> bar<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
up bar so that's the way I'm gonna do it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.490 
up bar so that's the way I'm gonna do it
okay<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.840> now<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> show<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> where

okay so now I'm going to show you where
all<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> spots<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> second

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
all the spots are so this is the second

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.310 
all the spots are so this is the second
one<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.600> found<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.140> sort<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
one that I found it's in this sort of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
one that I found it's in this sort of
like<00:00:40.379> Stonehenge<00:00:41.010> II<00:00:41.160> area<00:00:41.489> over<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.149> in

India near the edge and now it's all out
I'll<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> coordinates<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> one

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I'll do the coordinates so it's this one

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.729 
I'll do the coordinates so it's this one
right<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.399> coordinates<00:00:48.739> and

it's<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> chest<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.070> by<00:01:47.280> itself<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.119> here

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it's just a chest all by itself and here

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's just a chest all by itself and here
is<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> music<00:01:49.049> disc<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is the music disc and then here is the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
is the music disc and then here is the
sixth<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.770> actually<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> tower<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
sixth one is actually in the tower of
this<00:01:54.479> desert<00:01:55.049> village<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:55.860> here's<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this desert village here here's the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.859 
this desert village here here's the
coordinates

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.020 

and<00:02:00.500> we<00:02:00.560> over<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.859> chest<00:02:01.070> it's<00:02:01.640> got<00:02:01.789> that<00:02:01.909> in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and we over the chest it's got that in

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.859 
and we over the chest it's got that in
the<00:02:02.090> chest<00:02:02.299> plate<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.039> number<00:02:04.159> six

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
the chest plate so that is number six
