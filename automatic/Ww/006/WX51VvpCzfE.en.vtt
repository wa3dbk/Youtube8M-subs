00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.770
 Here people showed sky-high jubilant to death sadly I believe 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.560
 Little Lotte has found it, but what remains 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 Hill record and the first one can take Emilio man otherwise gave 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.000
 many announcements crashed but he also barely gave a chance at the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.330
 Conditions but a few meters of a primary but narrow victory in the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.060
 He did not stand a chance 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.029
 What should I say to all that said 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.079
 such jump 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.929
 despite all this, the exception in the dramaturgy is Schlierenzauer 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.579
 Morgenstern caught up on one side and what's up with me 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.649
 the most blatant case of the legacy that he has lost but you always have to 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.139
 get used to it again that's the reality with it you have to expect 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.679
 and whoever counts per share numbers, he just has every bill without the host 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.510
 it is said too much but we will still have to say 13 again 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.350
 over 3000 m Foster ten thousand fans in the arena who have all cheered me 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.250
 without a great mood on Wednesday as the first off the train Lindahl entitled 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.340
 Becker want Artur k there is no discussion 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.570
 These are trendy festive speeches and just over my corpse with more 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.390
 Pictures but talked about that will and twice today says 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 Mahn 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.920
 but the value should once again be characterized by excitement translated Radnor 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 Throw it in another direction the most interesting question for me is the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 wrong word is the national coach 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.530
 it seems to them that he chose Richie Freitag 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.369
 Index finger lifted Pascal Bodmer has the reason Margit Schmid is unlucky today 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.570
 had 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.640
 Axel Priebs 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.070
 white stressed driving very clean and at Ling if we stay tuned 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.760
 Stay tuned to research it can not take that long anymore 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.159
 one settles in the still two Skifliegen and allegedly ten of not 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:40.730
 to 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.900
 Maybe it's already rifle in qualifying on Friday 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.800
 Oberstdorf which we of course broadcast live again goes on there 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.310
 and if not then we set up the team and there must be the shot 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.070
 sign 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.580
 that's how easy it is 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.390
 we could do it at ddr times second commander round 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.310
 So plans to three out of 14 clock back out sports
