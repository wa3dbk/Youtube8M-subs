00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 well it is all in all 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.680
 cataclysms and I hope you go 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.240
 well 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.500
 in any case me it's really great 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.539
 well and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.279
 a whole new beginning a whole 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.199
 new video about the titanium clan or 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.480
 on the ruin and do as you want 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.439
 so that's a pretty special topic but 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.540
 first of all I would like to introduce you 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.150
 the gameplay is simply a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.850
 nuclear triple on the map that investigates 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.980
 on the black ops that is the n by 94 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.379
 khiter congratulated him in the comments 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 or go see his channel subscribe 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.829
 as you want to have to elite these 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.000
 videos go see his videos here that's me 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.890
 is extremely happy and it 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.660
 would do is extremely pleasure so there 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.219
 I can now move on or about 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.079
 the video that's just the 10 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.430
 things you did not know about google 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.239
 finally you probably do not know 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.949
 because it's true that you can 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.359
 know things 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.250
 So here we go right away to 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.740
 subject way to the first thing you 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 probably did not know about google 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.630
 the first post from google on twitter 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.369
 was at yann 0 0 1 0 0 these are the stuff 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.729
 codes of computer hordes 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.530
 and that's the translation it's i'm feeling 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.229
 lucky i do not know if my english accent 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 is great but it means face and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.649
 This is what is written next to the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.819
 google search box all 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.709
 simply because right away at the 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.920
 second thing you did not know without 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.000
 doubt on google the first server 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.880
 from google was simply 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 built in lego it consisted of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.420
 hard drive of 4 gigabyte each he me 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.619
 seems here in lego culture indices he 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.849
 had to do so we move everything from 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.030
 following the third thing you 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.739
 probably did not know the first leader of 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.700
 the company the first chef 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.130
 google business 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.929
 so he was previously group leader 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.879
 the grateful dead so I do not know this 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.000
 group 1 you can go see on 

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:59.560
 google just a ski ski bottom 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.479
 the grateful dead group 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.569
 so here I am going to listen to them after 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 So I tell you this later one 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.360
 go right to the fourth thing 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.860
 that you probably did not know about 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.479
 google 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.400
 so here's google every year where 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.770
 about 200 goats so that's 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.819
 completely what the fuck lÃ© but tight 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 it's reality 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.310
 he rents about 200 goats for the tone 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.260
 from the lawn of their head office to 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.180
 mountain view and the goal is to reduce 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.969
 imprint 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.390
 of carbon from the head office while 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.760
 simply 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.049
 so we immediately think of the 5th 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.549
 things you probably do not know 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.069
 it seems to me far this is the fifth 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.920
 here in 1999 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.639
 google had tried to sell his 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.439
 company here google by ic site for 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.879
 a million dollars that had written 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.579
 had his own search engine 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.700
 but the CEO of google refused to 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.620
 the horizon not accept this sale 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.500
 simply so does not follow at the sixth 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.510
 things you probably do not know the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.459
 first google doodle finally this is the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.689
 google doodle this is a modification of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.459
 the google image was made in 1999 they 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.230
 did it because he warned who 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.480
 went to the office at last he went to the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.419
 festival I know what else 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.919
 just for they could fix 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.090
 google technical problems if he 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.129
 were there during their absence 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.379
 they changed the logo for gold for 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.659
 prevent that to users so here 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.840
 right away at the 7th things you do not 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.519
 did not know then who is the rules of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.500
 google that you can not be 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 serious without wearing a suit 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.040
 so I do not really know 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.769
 understood the sentence but it is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.840
 in the ten fundamental principles that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.030
 guide the company so here we go 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.729
 right away at the 8th things you 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.709
 probably did not know the name google has 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.169
 been found by accident this is a 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.620
 wrong way to write google wave 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.689
 google 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.949
 toulon did this joke anyway 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.310
 but it's really a wrong way 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.919
 describe goal is the number 10 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.840
 power meaning that is to say a follow-up of 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.220
 100.0 so that's a wrong way 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.389
 describe google with two to go ho ho ho 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.919
 geoeye this is not google like we 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.319
 know us so here it was a 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.530
 misspelling and normally that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.229
 should not be google the 9th things and 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.989
 simply the first google ad has 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.370
 been bought in 2009 for specially 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.709
 for the super bowl so here's the 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.930
 google's first ad was in 2009 and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.849
 maintained a share everything on google but 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.490
 well it does not matter 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.750
 and finally in 10th position in second at 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.169
 first row as you want it 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.789
 google has the most 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.180
 information in his hard drives at 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.610
 world 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.710
 so here is try 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.810
 it's the hard drive that contains the most 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.610
 information and he can register at 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.830
 less than 2 billion information per 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.259
 second 2 that's me I do not have it in my 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.060
 hard disk computer I would like 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.469
 last buy them a hard drive so 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.210
 that's all for this video me I you 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:54.669
 say it to the lease it was cataclysm 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.669
 do not hesitate to subscribe to the udders
