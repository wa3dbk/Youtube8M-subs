00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
because i didn't really give this too

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
because i didn't really give this too
much<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.619> chance<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
much of a chance because it has a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.499 
much of a chance because it has a
strange<00:01:16.590> smell<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.299> very

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
strange smell to me because I'm very

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
strange smell to me because I'm very
sensitive<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.290> smell<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> has<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
sensitive to smell and this one has a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.469 
sensitive to smell and this one has a
kind<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> coconut<00:01:23.070> smell<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.090> guess<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
kind of coconut smell and I guess it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390
