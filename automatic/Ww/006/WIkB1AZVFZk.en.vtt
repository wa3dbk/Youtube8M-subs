00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.260
 I want to explain something as important today. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.640
 Is how to play the guitar strings 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.980
 Sounds simple 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.420
 In fact, many people have not studied how to play every sound. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.520
 This video is for all the friends who want to play good guys. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.400
 I will teach you how to play guitar strings. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 I will now demonstrate the correct and wrong method of bombing. 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.320
 If you haven’t learned to play the strings, the sound quality will look like this. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040
 What has just been demonstrated is the low-quality sound method. 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.820
 Now I will demonstrate a better stringing technique. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.540
 The whole music has become romantic and the sound quality is fuller. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.300
 I will teach you how to play guitar strings now. 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.480
 I will explain a technique for playing a single tone. 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.820
 This technique is called Rest stroke. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 Please pay attention to my right hand now. 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 All the focus is on the right hand 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.180
 First, learn how to polish your right fingernails. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.160
 Generally you can use simple nail files 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.940
 First polish the right nail to no sharp corners 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.120
 Then I will use the double star brand 2000 sandpaper 

00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:29.057
 Finishing the nails 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.040
 Make your nails as smooth as glass 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.520
 This is a great help to the sound quality of the strings. 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.840
 I use a nail that is about 1mm long. 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.980
 Now pay attention to how my right hand plays the string. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.460
 I will now demonstrate the correct movement of the strings. 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.820
 The thumb can be placed first in the 5th or 6th string 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.280
 Finger on the string 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.300
 Tilting about 45 degrees 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.000
 The right thumb will be a little more than the other fingers. 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.820
 Finger has three joints 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.440
 I will use this big joint to force 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.140
 The demonstration method I demonstrated does not use the joint in the middle of the finger. 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.740
 This string should generally be used for the string 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.340
 Put your finger on the string and slant about 45 degrees 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.780
 I will use this position of my fingernail to play the string instead of the middle of the finger. 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.600
 After the string is played, the finger will not fall directly below 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 After the string is played, it should fall to the next point. 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.300
 Wrap the string here, then the hand will stop at the point after the next string 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.960
 Instead of stopping directly below 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.120
 Fingers chord toward the palm of your hand 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.860
 This will pop up a soft sound. 

00:04:13.873 --> 00:04:16.513
 The wrong string method, the sound will come out like this 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.740
 a less soft sound quality 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.624
 Now look at the whole action again. 

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:26.149
 Big joint force 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.500
 Thumb on the 5th string 

00:04:28.744 --> 00:04:30.744
 Tilting about 45 degrees 

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:33.795
 Nail side 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.300
 Finger to the palm of your hand 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080
 This technique can be used to play a single tone. 

00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:53.752
 The effect of playing music will be like this 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.180
 It’s that simple;) See you next time.
