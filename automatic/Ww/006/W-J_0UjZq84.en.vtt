just like that no now we're going to
take<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:05.210> braided<00:03:06.210> line<00:03:10.700> we're<00:03:11.700> gonna<00:03:11.790> thread

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
take a braided line we're gonna thread

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.880 
take a braided line we're gonna thread
the<00:03:12.510> braid<00:03:13.880> through<00:03:14.880> those<00:03:15.090> beads<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the braid through those beads in the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.610 
the braid through those beads in the
body<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.520> book<00:03:17.810> there<00:03:18.810> got<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> lot<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.440> a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
body of the book there got a lot of a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:29.000 
body of the book there got a lot of a
shaft<00:03:26.570> just<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.959> i<00:03:27.989> only<00:03:28.230> run<00:03:28.680> through

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
shaft just like that i only run through

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.770 
shaft just like that i only run through
three<00:03:29.400> leave<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.330> head<00:03:30.570> bead<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
three leave that head bead right at the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.890 
three leave that head bead right at the
yeah<00:03:33.780> i<00:03:34.050> has<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> hook<00:03:37.489> back<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.670> throw<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:42.060> pick

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
yeah i has a hook back to throw or pick

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.690 
yeah i has a hook back to throw or pick
my<00:03:43.050> first<00:03:43.290> wraps<00:03:44.420> between<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.660> last<00:03:46.700> second

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
my first wraps between that last second

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.460 
my first wraps between that last second
to<00:03:47.820> last<00:03:47.970> bead<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.930> shank<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.170> then

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
to last bead on the shank here and then

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.270 
to last bead on the shank here and then
we<00:03:53.160> can<00:03:53.310> adjust<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:55.410> braided<00:03:55.800> line<00:03:55.950> from

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
we can adjust the braided line from

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.720 
we can adjust the braided line from
there<00:03:56.489> i<00:03:56.760> mean<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.269> little<00:03:57.600> bit<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.840> slack<00:03:58.200> that

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
there i mean a little bit of slack that

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.020 
there i mean a little bit of slack that
we<00:03:59.730> can<00:03:59.910> keep<00:04:00.239> these<00:04:00.540> beads<00:04:00.900> free<00:04:01.350> moving<00:04:02.030> but

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
we can keep these beads free moving but

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.570 
we can keep these beads free moving but
you<00:04:03.269> need<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.510> keep<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.900> tight<00:04:04.200> enough<00:04:04.580> but

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
you need to keep it tight enough but

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.160 
you need to keep it tight enough but
they<00:04:05.700> don't<00:04:05.880> flop<00:04:06.239> off<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> side<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:09.170> most

wrapping<00:04:44.450> on<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:47.060> important<00:04:47.540> to

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
wrapping on this so it's important to

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.160 
wrapping on this so it's important to
make<00:04:48.710> sure<00:04:48.860> you've<00:04:49.100> got<00:04:49.130> your<00:04:49.580> base<00:04:50.180> really

I've learned my lesson on this one

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:30.580 
I've learned my lesson on this one
before<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.730> could<00:05:14.240> have<00:05:14.510> forgotten<00:05:29.590> rated

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
tight at the beginning because you can

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.180

glass beads will really help this get

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.189 
glass beads will really help this get
