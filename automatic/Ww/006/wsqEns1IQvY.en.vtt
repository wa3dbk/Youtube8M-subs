00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
six life he takes four again yeah I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779

think<00:00:28.680> he<00:00:28.859> basically<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.399> going<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.669> have

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
think he basically is just going to have

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
think he basically is just going to have
to<00:00:29.820> spend<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.269> mana<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> char<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.320> then<00:00:31.529> hope

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to spend some mana to char and then hope

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
to spend some mana to char and then hope
the<00:00:31.829> top<00:00:32.040> deck<00:00:32.449> he<00:00:33.449> might<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.780> heavy<00:00:33.960> damage

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
