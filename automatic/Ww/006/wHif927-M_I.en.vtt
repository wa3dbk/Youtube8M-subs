different<00:01:12.090> color<00:01:12.270> scheme<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:12.830> it's<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
different color scheme also it's like a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
landline and issuance um close game put
together<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.200> color<00:01:19.380> scheme

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
together it's the right color scheme

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.460 
together it's the right color scheme

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.460 
ugly I think I might just get some neon
stickers<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:22.300> stands<00:02:22.660> out<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> darker

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.290 
stickers it stands out on the darker
colors<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> might<00:02:24.519> just<00:02:24.670> get<00:02:24.790> somebody<00:02:25.030> onto

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
colors so I might just get somebody onto

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.290 
colors so I might just get somebody onto
the<00:02:25.630> guys<00:02:25.810> from<00:02:25.930> cube<00:02:26.230> Smith<00:02:26.760> um<00:02:29.220> yeah<00:02:30.300> overall

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
the guys from cube Smith um yeah overall

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.740 
the guys from cube Smith um yeah overall
it's<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> really<00:02:31.480> good<00:02:31.900> cube<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.569> some<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.690> the

it's a really good cube and some of the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.170 
it's a really good cube and some of the
stickers<00:02:35.140> are<00:02:35.260> misaligned<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.310> guess<00:02:40.030> it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
stickers are misaligned but I guess it's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720

fine<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> silver<00:02:41.319> side<00:02:41.730> instead

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
fine and they have a silver side instead

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.120 
fine and they have a silver side instead
of<00:02:42.910> white<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:45.360> there<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.660> I'm<00:02:47.530> not<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> fan<00:02:48.100> of

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
of white so there and I'm not a fan of

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.960 
of white so there and I'm not a fan of
the<00:02:48.400> non<00:02:49.120> huge<00:02:49.360> fan<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.900> sparkly<00:02:50.319> nest

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.759 

hold<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.090> i'll<00:02:55.780> show<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.140> detail<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.709> it

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
hold on i'll show you in detail what it

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:04.700 
hold on i'll show you in detail what it
looks<00:02:57.010> like

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.420 

some<00:03:05.490> reason<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.330> doesn't<00:03:06.600> want<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.960> focus

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
some reason it doesn't want to focus

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.900 
some reason it doesn't want to focus
their<00:03:09.200> see<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.650> very<00:03:10.740> sparkly<00:03:13.670> yeah<00:03:14.670> I'm<00:03:14.760> not

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
their see it's very sparkly yeah I'm not

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.160 
their see it's very sparkly yeah I'm not
a<00:03:14.940> huge<00:03:15.150> fan<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.750> um<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.960> same

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
a huge fan of that um it is the same

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.660 
a huge fan of that um it is the same
size<00:03:19.440> as<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.710> Rubik's<00:03:20.190> Cube<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.640> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
size as a Rubik's Cube this is like a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.520 
size as a Rubik's Cube this is like a
normal<00:03:24.150> capesize<00:03:26.060> probably<00:03:27.060> yeah<00:03:27.930> great

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
normal capesize probably yeah great

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.070 
normal capesize probably yeah great
about<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.920> same<00:03:29.280> size<00:03:30.890> which<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:31.920> pretty<00:03:32.400> good

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
about the same size which is pretty good

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.940 
about the same size which is pretty good
um<00:03:34.080> it's<00:03:34.470> very<00:03:34.830> easy<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.220> solve<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:36.860> method<00:03:37.860> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
um it's very easy to solve the method I

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.790 
um it's very easy to solve the method I
used<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.370> solve<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.030> monkey<00:03:39.300> do<00:03:39.630> 13<00:03:40.140> 13<00:03:40.620> s

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
used to solve this is monkey do 13 13 s

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.190 
used to solve this is monkey do 13 13 s
one<00:03:40.950> algorithm<00:03:41.370> method<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.600> really<00:03:42.960> easy

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
one algorithm method it's really easy

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
one algorithm method it's really easy
and<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.220> fast<00:03:44.520> way<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.730> solve<00:03:45.030> this

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and it's a really fast way to solve this

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.960 
and it's a really fast way to solve this
cube<00:03:45.510> it's<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:45.990> good<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> yeah<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.490> suggest

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
cube it's really good so yeah I suggest

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.610 
cube it's really good so yeah I suggest
you<00:03:48.030> go<00:03:48.210> check<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.750> out<00:03:49.460> so<00:03:50.460> yeah<00:03:50.930> um<00:03:51.930> get

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you go check that out so yeah um get

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.930 
you go check that out so yeah um get

this from a light take free shipping and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.610 
this from a light take free shipping and
I'm<00:03:56.940> gonna<00:03:57.210> go<00:03:57.390> check<00:03:57.690> out<00:03:57.870> cube<00:03:58.290> twist

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
I'm gonna go check out cube twist

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.640 
I'm gonna go check out cube twist
because<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.520> want<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.390> see<00:04:00.540> how<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:00.870> thus<00:04:01.320> cube

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
because I want to see how much thus cube

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.220 
because I want to see how much thus cube
is<00:04:01.770> on<00:04:02.010> their<00:04:02.250> site<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> haven't<00:04:04.110> checked

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
is on their site but I haven't checked

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.540 
is on their site but I haven't checked
that<00:04:04.350> out<00:04:04.440> yet<00:04:06.260> overall<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.590> get<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.250> cube

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
that out yet overall just get this cube

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.360 
that out yet overall just get this cube
it's<00:04:08.700> real<00:04:08.880> good<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.710> think<00:04:10.710> it's<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.920> cheapest

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it's real good I think it's the cheapest

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
it's real good I think it's the cheapest
cube<00:04:11.850> on<00:04:12.390> their<00:04:12.690> site<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:14.250> UM<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.970> white<00:04:15.150> one

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
cube on their site the UM the white one

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.850 
cube on their site the UM the white one
actually<00:04:15.780> might<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:15.960> cheaper<00:04:16.230> but<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.560> wanted

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
actually might be cheaper but I wanted

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.210 
actually might be cheaper but I wanted
the<00:04:16.980> black<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.460> I<00:04:18.110> wanted<00:04:19.110> like<00:04:19.290> because<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
the black one I wanted like because I

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.360 
the black one I wanted like because I
already<00:04:20.370> got<00:04:20.670> a<00:04:20.910> white<00:04:21.120> cube<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:21.780> yeah<00:04:22.560> go

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
already got a white cube so yeah go

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.910 
already got a white cube so yeah go
check<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.820> out<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> cube<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.260> ask<00:04:25.680> you

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
check it out this is the cube to ask you
