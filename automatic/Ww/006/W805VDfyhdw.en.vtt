00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.010
 in our life there are very few bright and 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.320
 interesting events when we breathe full 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.349
 breast enjoy bright emotions 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:33.080
 for many people just such an event 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:41.809
 became the festival air of the heart interfering 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:44.149
 move any creativity where there is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.620
 some kind of personal thoughts 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.980
 the beginning is good 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.650
 at the festival of rock music how I grow 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:03.870
 I think 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:01:03.870
 there is a terrible 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.970
 long live the festival open 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.480
 sky as they say by charging our 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.670
 batteries 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.710
 long life just here on this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.740
 the place we are a special thank you to the sponsors 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.380
 who support it all look so 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.770
 everything is arranged well he slides 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.520
 made the power zone done very well 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.400
 I like everything and attend the festival 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.320
 the air is constantly I see the difference as 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.420
 It was before and how much better it became 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.450
 now he is the only one 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.680
 cultural event had such a city 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.680
 truly cultural 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.670
 festival air is very 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.610
 the necessary thing is our event 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.500
 Karelian summer uniting pieces i 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.479
 I see many different faces here a month before 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.330
 the festival with whom I would not talk there 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.270
 everyone said we of course go shorter 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.009
 Hello everyone, we listen carefully 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.200
 music on someone's help and a little 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.200
 because your hand is still unclear 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.870
 higher 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.300
 I thought that the figures become of it makes no sense 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 because people do not go to numbers people 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.820
 go on emotions and i can only say 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.040
 one thing is all the lights and it sounded 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.710
 in European quality we did 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.270
 such a picture that can 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.270
 envy any European 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.030
 let good eyes good good 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.170
 young people 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.030
 simply and honestly didn't even expect well 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.970
 would have played Orenburg yesterday 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.970
 festival new and old rock here 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 somewhat more powerful will be though 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 Generally it will be more powerful 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.610
 air festival is the brightest 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.950

 year with the same support of the audience and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.040
 volunteers we will be able to raise the bar 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.890
 festival even higher 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.140
