00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.280
 good morning everyone welcome to the new one 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.700
 episode of seizing that passion 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.220
 today we will make a guide to disassemble the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.439
 air filter in the petrol turbos yes 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.919
 here we also have an accident 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.590
 the escort will show the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.450
 procedure is very simple 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.130
 then to open the filter case vi 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.170
 need a star screwdriver like this 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.730
 here 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.710
 you have to unscrew these four screws 1 2 3 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 and 4 and you can stand the filter case for 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.929
 help you do better 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.879
 it suits you with a slotted screwdriver 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.839
 unfasten the clamp and remove the 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.839
 rubber sleeve 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 once you have unscrewed the screws you can 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.850
 remove the cover 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.070
 remember that he is stuck in these 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.840
 two points then to test it for five 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.950
 once skips the blanket Case 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.210
 filter you can extract the filter 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.030
 clean well with a compressor that will be 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.549
 all the filter case and wash the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.159
 filter material now the case filters 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.340
 clean we can insert our 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.270
 filter that will go in one side sees the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.320
 the narrower part must be stuck 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 at the base let's put it down just one set 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 lost so you can't go wrong 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.049
 make sure it adheres perfectly 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.780
 to the walls 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:00.250
 ok and at this point reassemble the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.039
 cover for mounting the lid 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.969
 filter case you will have to position 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.290
 initially this plastic on the side 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.630
 where the three first toothed feet all 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.370
 you have to fit them in these three holes e 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.340
 immediately afterwards you will have to match them all 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 the various forums for victims 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.250
 one advice I give you is to 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.819
 insert remove the metal clamp 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.700
 and insert the sleeve inside 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.610
 the tube before performing the maneuver e 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.230
 then start again in series inserting the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.030
 tooth with the lower one the more 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 near the front because it is what 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.200
 bastard and tents did not mean not 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.319
 slip immediately after spin holding 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.120
 pushed in this direction 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.420
 inca also tightens the other three up to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.049
 bring down all the filter case 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.390
 and you will need to verify that the holes i 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.720
 four out for the screws to be 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.750
 aligned at this point I recommend you 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 impress all four screws so 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.329
 to verify that everything is aligned 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.329
 then he squeezed them a little at a time 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.700
 probably in an alternating way 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.799
 to match the whole perfectly 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.569
 filter case and take it one beat 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.849
 Once attached to the four screws take 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.010
 it's a nipper like this for 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.440
 break the wire and in this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.299
 way squeezing in this way 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.700
 close the strap in the position 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.049
 correct I recommend the tooth should 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.049
 be inside the poor
