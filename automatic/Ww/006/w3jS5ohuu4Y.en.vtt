00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
about it now a long plant again planting

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.050 
about it now a long plant again planting
for<00:01:26.670> long<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
for long so you get but you get the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
for long so you get but you get the
benefit<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.479> seeing<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.110> cat<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.619> well

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
benefit of seeing it from cat as well

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.999 
benefit of seeing it from cat as well
but<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> main<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> plant<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
but the main point of this plant is to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.249 
but the main point of this plant is to
plant<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.759> long<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.540> someone<00:01:36.840> could<00:01:36.990> go<00:01:37.110> into

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
plant for long so someone could go into

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.359 
plant for long so someone could go into
pit<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.810> porch<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:41.070> because

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pit or you can just porch just because

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.960 
pit or you can just porch just because
it's<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.700> open<00:01:41.970> plant<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.729> very<00:01:44.729> good

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's an open plant and it's very good

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
it's an open plant and it's very good
for<00:01:45.030> after<00:01:45.360> plant<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> should<00:01:46.200> only<00:01:46.470> do

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
for after plant but you should only do

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.450 
for after plant but you should only do
this<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.960> CT<00:01:48.960> long<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.680> cat<00:01:50.070> control

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
this if you have CT long and cat control

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
this if you have CT long and cat control
or<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.939> smoked<00:01:51.360> off<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:51.869> again

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
or you have it smoked off because again

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340 
or you have it smoked off because again
high<00:01:52.590> risk<00:01:52.860> equals<00:01:53.280> high<00:01:53.369> reward<00:01:54.170> now<00:01:55.170> let's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
high risk equals high reward now let's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
high risk equals high reward now let's
head<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> bee<00:01:56.310> site<00:01:56.549> where<00:01:56.820> i<00:01:57.329> like

head over to the bee site where i like

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
head over to the bee site where i like

gallon flexes is that the counter tires

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.530 
gallon flexes is that the counter tires

you<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.750> planning<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you all planning but that's just the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
you all planning but that's just the
risk<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> plant<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.500> open<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.580> does

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
risk of the plant and open but it does

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
risk of the plant and open but it does
give<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> good<00:02:09.660> reward<00:02:09.780> where<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> can

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
give you a good reward where you can

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.410 
give you a good reward where you can
just<00:02:10.890> jiggle<00:02:11.520> peek<00:02:11.670> from<00:02:11.819> cat

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
just jiggle peek from cat

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
just jiggle peek from cat
and<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.230> from<00:02:13.290> parts<00:02:13.770> of
