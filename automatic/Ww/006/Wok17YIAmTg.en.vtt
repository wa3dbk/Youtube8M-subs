00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
expecting a little bit better than QJ

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.010 
expecting a little bit better than QJ
and<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.490> definitely<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.840> it's

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
and it is not definitely not that it's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.479 
and it is not definitely not that it's
probably<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.709> with<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> worst<00:02:09.310> one

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
probably actually with the worst one

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.350 
probably actually with the worst one
it's<00:02:09.720> pretty<00:02:10.720> rough<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.670> gold<00:02:13.209> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's pretty rough I like the gold and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's pretty rough I like the gold and
the<00:02:13.480> white<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.680> other<00:02:14.950> than<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.160> really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the white but other than that really

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.920 
the white but other than that really
rough<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:17.080> can't<00:02:17.350> turn<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:18.130> finger<00:02:18.930> but

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
rough you can't turn this one finger but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
rough you can't turn this one finger but
I<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.860> QJ<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:23.350> turn<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I think I can I'm QJ I can turn on the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.390 
I think I can I'm QJ I can turn on the
turn<00:02:25.060> one<00:02:25.270> Leon<00:02:25.510> QJ<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.350> one<00:02:26.500> finger<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:27.370> I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
turn one Leon QJ with one finger but I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100 
turn one Leon QJ with one finger but I

and the methods pyraminx which I was not
expecting<00:02:43.750> at<00:02:44.170> all<00:02:44.319> as<00:02:44.620> connecting<00:02:45.130> ate<00:02:45.280> my

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
expecting at all as connecting ate my

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.170 
expecting at all as connecting ate my
professor<00:02:46.810> bearings<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:51.010> really<00:02:51.850> heavy

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
professor bearings is it's really heavy

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.570 
professor bearings is it's really heavy
because<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.350> tile<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.220> 30th

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
because it's like tile to the 30th

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.960 
because it's like tile to the 30th
anniversary<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:57.459> feels<00:02:57.610> really<00:02:57.730> heavy

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
anniversary so just feels really heavy

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.740 
anniversary so just feels really heavy
really<00:02:58.900> cliquey<00:02:59.260> I<00:03:00.420> don't<00:03:01.420> know<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.570> this

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
really cliquey I don't know if this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.000 
really cliquey I don't know if this
makes<00:03:01.900> sense<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.350> feels<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.769> like

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
makes sense but it feels like it like

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.330 
makes sense but it feels like it like
rocks<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.760> dough<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.100> bunch<00:03:06.250> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
rocks or dough I can you have a bunch of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.680 
rocks or dough I can you have a bunch of
rocks<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:06.760> hand<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.180> start<00:03:07.420> moving

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
rocks in your hand and you start moving

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.259 
rocks in your hand and you start moving
it<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.320> sounds<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:12.120> hope<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
it and it sounds like that hope that

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.110 
it and it sounds like that hope that
makes<00:03:13.420> any<00:03:13.660> sense<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:15.340> tip<00:03:15.609> move<00:03:15.910> pretty

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
makes any sense but the tip move pretty

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.590 
makes any sense but the tip move pretty
good<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:18.549> just<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:18.850> heavy<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.239> wasn't

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
good and it's just really heavy I wasn't

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.440 
good and it's just really heavy I wasn't
expecting<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.739> be<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:21.010> heavy<00:03:21.420> when<00:03:22.420> I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
expecting this to be that heavy when I

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.259 
expecting this to be that heavy when I
saw<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.079> there's<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.980> quick<00:03:24.220> unboxing<00:03:24.370> so

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
saw it so there's that quick unboxing so

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.550 
saw it so there's that quick unboxing so
