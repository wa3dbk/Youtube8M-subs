00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
of the lens design just because it's a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.390

most<00:05:19.380> lenses<00:05:19.650> in<00:05:20.010> case<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.280> didn't<00:05:20.550> know<00:05:20.669> have

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
most lenses in case you didn't know have

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.510 
most lenses in case you didn't know have
their<00:05:21.600> focal<00:05:21.870> lengths<00:05:22.080> determined<00:05:22.590> by<00:05:22.860> when

they're<00:05:23.669> focused<00:05:24.030> at<00:05:24.180> infinity<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.960> when<00:05:25.229> you

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
they're focused at infinity so when you

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.560 
they're focused at infinity so when you
focus<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.770> lens<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.190> infinity<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> 70

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.230 
to 100 36 millimeter lens this isn't
necessarily<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.370> negative<00:05:38.580> but<00:05:39.090> it's

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
necessarily a negative but it's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.400 
necessarily a negative but it's
something<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.510> should<00:05:39.750> be<00:05:39.780> aware<00:05:39.960> of<00:05:40.169> before

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
something you should be aware of before

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.400

you<00:05:40.770> buy<00:05:40.950> this<00:05:41.220> lens<00:05:41.520> for<00:05:41.789> me<00:05:42.390> this<00:05:42.930> actually

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
you buy this lens for me this actually

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.690 
you buy this lens for me this actually
doesn't<00:05:43.620> really<00:05:43.860> matter<00:05:44.100> too<00:05:44.310> much<00:05:44.490> because

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
doesn't really matter too much because

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.430 
doesn't really matter too much because
when<00:05:45.030> I'm<00:05:45.150> up<00:05:45.360> close<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.750> personal<00:05:46.229> I'm

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
when I'm up close and personal I'm

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.020 
when I'm up close and personal I'm
normally<00:05:46.890> kind<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.160> stuck<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.550> small<00:05:47.820> room

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
normally kind of stuck in a small room

doing<00:05:48.270> event<00:05:48.570> photography<00:05:49.169> we're<00:05:49.410> covering<00:05:49.680> a

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
doing event photography we're covering a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.710 
doing event photography we're covering a
wedding<00:05:50.130> like<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.430> was<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.640> few<00:05:50.940> weeks<00:05:51.210> ago<00:05:51.390> and

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
wedding like I was a few weeks ago and

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.930 
wedding like I was a few weeks ago and
for<00:05:52.470> me<00:05:52.560> that's<00:05:52.860> good<00:05:53.280> because<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.669> means<00:05:53.789> I

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
for me that's good because it means I

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.460 
for me that's good because it means I
don't<00:05:54.000> have<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.300> change<00:05:54.539> lenses<00:05:54.870> as<00:05:55.289> much

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
don't have to change lenses as much

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.080 
don't have to change lenses as much
because<00:05:55.919> this<00:05:56.100> gets<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.520> little<00:05:56.610> bit<00:05:56.850> wider

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
because this gets a little bit wider

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.790 
because this gets a little bit wider
which<00:05:57.479> kind<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.720> helps<00:05:58.020> me<00:05:58.050> for<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.470> setting

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
which kind of helps me for the setting

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.469 
which kind of helps me for the setting
so<00:05:59.010> it's<00:05:59.310> just<00:05:59.400> something<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.970> keep<00:06:00.120> in<00:06:00.270> mind

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
so it's just something to keep in mind

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.200 
so it's just something to keep in mind
when<00:06:00.810> you're<00:06:00.900> buying<00:06:01.110> this<00:06:01.320> lens<00:06:01.650> now<00:06:02.639> this

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
when you're buying this lens now this

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.000 
when you're buying this lens now this
lens<00:06:03.479> even<00:06:03.960> with<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.169> focus<00:06:04.530> breathing<00:06:04.860> issue

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
lens even with the focus breathing issue

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.640 
lens even with the focus breathing issue
is<00:06:05.310> still<00:06:05.700> good<00:06:06.389> for<00:06:06.720> portraiture<00:06:07.050> because<00:06:07.530> it

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
is still good for portraiture because it

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.140 
is still good for portraiture because it
will<00:06:07.770> provide<00:06:08.039> a<00:06:08.100> compression<00:06:08.639> effect

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
will provide a compression effect

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.879 
will provide a compression effect
because<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.600> focal<00:06:09.900> lengths<00:06:10.139> are<00:06:10.260> still<00:06:10.470> long

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
because the focal lengths are still long

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.500 
because the focal lengths are still long
enough<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.580> compression<00:06:12.060> effect<00:06:12.270> is

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
enough the compression effect is

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.940 
enough the compression effect is
flattering<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.169> doesn't<00:06:13.410> make<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.620> person's

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
flattering and doesn't make the person's

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.580 
flattering and doesn't make the person's
face<00:06:14.100> appear<00:06:14.550> bloated<00:06:15.210> however<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.320> wouldn't

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
face appear bloated however I wouldn't

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.320 
face appear bloated however I wouldn't
recommend<00:06:16.919> that<00:06:17.160> you<00:06:17.280> get<00:06:17.400> this<00:06:17.550> lens<00:06:17.880> for<00:06:18.240> the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
recommend that you get this lens for the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.629 
recommend that you get this lens for the
sole<00:06:18.570> purposes<00:06:19.110> of<00:06:19.350> taking<00:06:19.860> portraits<00:06:20.190> there

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
sole purposes of taking portraits there

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.010 
sole purposes of taking portraits there
are<00:06:20.700> much<00:06:20.820> better<00:06:21.000> dedicated<00:06:21.660> portrait

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
are much better dedicated portrait

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.200 
are much better dedicated portrait
lenses<00:06:22.350> like<00:06:22.650> say<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.070> 85<00:06:23.490> millimeter<00:06:23.910> at<00:06:24.060> one

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
lenses like say the 85 millimeter at one

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.540 
lenses like say the 85 millimeter at one
point<00:06:24.419> for<00:06:24.720> that<00:06:25.260> cost<00:06:25.500> less<00:06:25.860> than<00:06:26.070> this<00:06:26.250> lens

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
point for that cost less than this lens

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.900 
point for that cost less than this lens
at<00:06:27.260> $2,300<00:06:28.260> this<00:06:28.710> lens<00:06:28.919> is<00:06:29.100> a<00:06:29.130> pricey<00:06:29.550> but

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
at $2,300 this lens is a pricey but

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.270

that the twenty three hundred dollar

that the twenty three hundred dollar
price<00:06:46.169> tag<00:06:46.229> is<00:06:46.620> quite<00:06:46.800> a<00:06:46.830> plunge<00:06:47.129> to<00:06:47.370> take<00:06:47.580> but

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
price tag is quite a plunge to take but

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.129

any lens but that's just what

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.649 
any lens but that's just what
photography<00:07:34.830> is<00:07:35.000> overall<00:07:36.000> I'm<00:07:36.270> going<00:07:36.449> to<00:07:36.539> give

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659

this<00:07:36.779> lens<00:07:37.050> a<00:07:37.259> 9<00:07:37.409> out<00:07:37.529> of<00:07:37.620> 10<00:07:37.860> because<00:07:38.310> of<00:07:38.460> its

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
this lens a 9 out of 10 because of its

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.490 
this lens a 9 out of 10 because of its
great<00:07:38.849> focusing<00:07:39.389> and<00:07:39.539> VR<00:07:39.779> systems<00:07:40.199> that<00:07:40.469> I

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 
great focusing and VR systems that I

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.499 
great focusing and VR systems that I
think<00:07:40.860> compensate<00:07:41.520> for<00:07:41.699> the<00:07:41.789> focus<00:07:42.029> breathing

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:42.509 
think compensate for the focus breathing

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.240 
think compensate for the focus breathing
