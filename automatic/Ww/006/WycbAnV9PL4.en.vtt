00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.110 

I<00:00:32.190> do<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.820> say<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.660> much<00:00:35.559> much<00:00:36.160> much

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
I do have to say it is much much much

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.110 
I do have to say it is much much much
slower<00:00:37.420> than<00:00:37.960> what<00:00:38.860> I'm<00:00:38.980> used<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.340> because<00:00:40.000> you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
slower than what I'm used to because you

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.430 
slower than what I'm used to because you
know<00:00:40.210> I'm<00:00:40.329> used<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.600> cruising<00:00:40.989> around<00:00:41.079> in<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
know I'm used to cruising around in the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.410 
know I'm used to cruising around in the
v6<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:44.530> adequate<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.910> not<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
v6 but it's adequate it's not the

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.479 
v6 but it's adequate it's not the
fastest<00:00:46.989> but<00:00:47.290> it's<00:00:47.920> definitely<00:00:48.309> not<00:00:48.430> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
fastest but it's definitely not the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.780 
fastest but it's definitely not the
slowest<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.180> mean<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.739> not<00:00:50.920> too<00:00:51.070> bad<00:00:51.250> we<00:00:51.670> can

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
slowest I mean it's not too bad we can

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.599 
slowest I mean it's not too bad we can
get<00:00:51.940> in<00:00:52.059> person<00:00:52.420> can<00:00:52.570> get<00:00:52.690> used<00:00:52.900> to<00:00:53.019> it

higher in order to you know get the same

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.639 
higher in order to you know get the same
performance<00:01:06.759> that<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.540> v6<00:01:07.990> would<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.439> much

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
performance that the v6 would and much

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.910 
performance that the v6 would and much
fewer<00:01:09.100> rpms<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.180> said<00:01:13.420> it's<00:01:13.570> adequate<00:01:13.920> I'm

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
actually on the way to two lows right

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.440 
actually on the way to two lows right
now<00:01:17.439> because<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:18.280> dealer<00:01:18.640> put<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:18.970> big<00:01:19.210> ugly
