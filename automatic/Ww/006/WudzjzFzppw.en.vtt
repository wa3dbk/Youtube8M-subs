00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
not to do that but that doesn't mean

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.009 
not to do that but that doesn't mean
he's<00:01:02.890> not<00:01:02.920> fantastic<00:01:03.760> but<00:01:04.269> what<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.510> do<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.900> I

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
he's not fantastic but what I do is I

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.370 
he's not fantastic but what I do is I
use<00:01:05.340> my<00:01:06.340> second<00:01:06.760> finger<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.450> when<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.659> tap<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:08.229> go

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
use my second finger so when I tap I go

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.520 
use my second finger so when I tap I go
ago<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.420> when<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.630> play<00:01:14.020> this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
ago so when I play this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.750 
ago so when I play this
I<00:01:14.580> play<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.760> arpeggio<00:01:16.150> like<00:01:16.630> normal<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.610> it's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
I play the arpeggio like normal so it's

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.700 
I play the arpeggio like normal so it's
a<00:01:18.880> down<00:01:19.090> pick<00:01:19.390> hammer

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.170 

but<00:01:24.460> then<00:01:24.670> when<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.820> go<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:26.790> hammer<00:01:27.790> on<00:01:28.150> to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
but then when I go to the a hammer on to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.150 
but then when I go to the a hammer on to
the<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:30.300> then<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.420> tap<00:01:31.480> and<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.170> pull-off<00:01:32.710> pull-off

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
the a then I tap and I pull-off pull-off

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:45.870 
the a then I tap and I pull-off pull-off
so<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.160> things<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.670> be

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
so it's one of the things you have to be

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.400 
so it's one of the things you have to be
concerned<00:01:46.330> about<00:01:46.450> when<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> play<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.200> is

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
concerned about when you play this is

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.460 
concerned about when you play this is
that<00:01:48.100> when<00:01:48.340> you're<00:01:48.580> using<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:49.570> shape<00:01:49.930> you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
that when you're using the shape you

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.109 
that when you're using the shape you
have<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.830> get<00:01:50.979> your<00:01:51.130> pick<00:01:51.369> out<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.940> way

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
have to get your pick out of the way

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.210 
have to get your pick out of the way
then<00:01:52.570> get<00:01:52.780> your<00:01:52.930> finger<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.260> there<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:53.920> how<00:01:54.160> do

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
of pointing it in that direction and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:34.410 
of pointing it in that direction and
then<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.500> also<00:02:32.680> find<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.180> no

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420

problem using a pick over the fret board
to<00:02:37.420> play<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.489> allows<00:02:42.730> me<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.030> lot

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to play because that allows me a lot

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.590 
to play because that allows me a lot
less<00:02:43.950> room<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.760> move<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.060> other<00:02:46.180> words<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.450> can

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
less room to move in other words I can

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.380 
less room to move in other words I can
be<00:02:46.720> faster<00:02:47.290> by<00:02:47.769> not<00:02:48.010> having<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.370> play<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
be faster by not having to play here and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.440 
be faster by not having to play here and
then<00:02:49.690> doing<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.380> quick<00:02:50.620> tap<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.150> can

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
then doing that quick tap now I can

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.199 
then doing that quick tap now I can
apply<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> same<00:02:53.080> idea<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:54.549> virtually<00:02:55.060> every

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
apply the same idea to virtually every

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.170 
apply the same idea to virtually every
arpeggio<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.739> let's<00:02:57.220> apply<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> other

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
arpeggio so let's apply it to the other

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.360 
arpeggio so let's apply it to the other
arpeggio<00:02:59.080> shape<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> showed<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.190> with

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
arpeggio shape that I showed you with

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:11.750 
arpeggio shape that I showed you with
five<00:03:00.580> strings<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:01.420> go<00:03:01.540> like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.330 

when<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.790> came<00:03:12.910> up<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.540> LA<00:03:13.900> scene<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
when I came up in the LA scene and and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.430 
when I came up in the LA scene and and
I'm<00:03:15.460> playing<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.150> know<00:03:16.240> in<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.480> local<00:03:16.840> band<00:03:17.050> and

and then Tony MacAlpine and all these
great<00:03:21.760> players<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.930> came<00:03:23.140> up<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.890> know<00:03:23.920> all

great players that came up you know all

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.300 
great players that came up you know all
of<00:03:24.220> us<00:03:24.460> in<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.700> same<00:03:24.880> generation<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.890> used<00:03:27.100> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
of us in the same generation we used to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.050 
of us in the same generation we used to
do<00:03:27.520> one<00:03:28.000> kind<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.450> sweep<00:03:29.310> extension<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.520> I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
do one kind of sweep extension and I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.720 
do one kind of sweep extension and I
kind<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.420> mean<00:03:31.690> dit<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.080> mi<00:03:32.290> sweep<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.280> what

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
kind of mean dit the mi sweep and what

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.600 
kind of mean dit the mi sweep and what
you<00:03:33.880> do<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.330> instead<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:34.780> going<00:03:38.490> what<00:03:39.490> we

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
you do is instead of just going what we

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.580 
you do is instead of just going what we
used<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.880> do<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.210> go<00:03:40.360> like<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.720> we<00:03:41.260> used<00:03:41.470> to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
used to do is go like this we used to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.120 
used to do is go like this we used to
use<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.730> note<00:03:43.120> before<00:03:43.590> slide<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:44.980> note

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
use the note before slide to the note

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.250 
use the note before slide to the note
you<00:03:45.280> want<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.580> play<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.060> back<00:03:46.480> down<00:03:46.690> again<00:03:46.720> and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
you want to play and back down again and

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.650 
you want to play and back down again and
so<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.740> has<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> really<00:03:48.520> cool<00:03:48.790> sound<00:03:49.090> I'll<00:03:49.420> play

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
so it has a really cool sound I'll play

00:03:49.660 --> 00:04:00.120 
so it has a really cool sound I'll play
it<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:49.990> slow<00:03:50.290> them<00:03:50.500> fast<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.860> we<00:03:59.980> used

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
it for you slow them fast so and we used

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.490 
it for you slow them fast so and we used
to<00:04:00.220> call<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.550> mi<00:04:00.910> sweep<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:02.020> just<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
to call it the mi sweep it's just a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.910 
to call it the mi sweep it's just a
variation<00:04:03.010> on<00:04:03.610> these<00:04:04.240> arpeggio<00:04:04.870> shapes<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
variation on these arpeggio shapes so I

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.500 
variation on these arpeggio shapes so I
thought<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.340> would<00:04:06.550> throw<00:04:06.580> that<00:04:06.850> in<00:04:07.150> because

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
thought I would throw that in because

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.480 
thought I would throw that in because
again<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.200> want<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.470> make<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.770> sound<00:04:08.950> good<00:04:09.250> and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
again you want to make it sound good and

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.150 
again you want to make it sound good and
sometimes<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.840> arpeggio<00:04:11.170> lend<00:04:11.590> itself<00:04:11.920> to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
sometimes the arpeggio lend itself to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.400 
sometimes the arpeggio lend itself to
that<00:04:12.310> sometimes<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.510> song<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.050> wanted<00:04:14.350> to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
that sometimes the song that I wanted to

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.080 
that sometimes the song that I wanted to
play<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.890> if<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.070> wanted<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> use<00:04:15.490> on<00:04:15.640> arpeggio

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
play and if I wanted to use on arpeggio

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.180 
play and if I wanted to use on arpeggio
shape<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.540> would<00:04:16.690> add<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.950> for<00:04:18.100> an

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
shape I would add that in just for an

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.850 
shape I would add that in just for an
extra<00:04:18.580> bit<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.850> color<00:04:19.120> just<00:04:19.210> for<00:04:19.510> extra<00:04:20.350> little

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
extra bit of color just for extra little

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.090 
extra bit of color just for extra little
nuance<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:22.180> make<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.480> sound<00:04:22.750> cool<00:04:23.040> yeah<00:04:24.040> you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
nuance to make it sound cool yeah you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.010 
nuance to make it sound cool yeah you
could<00:04:24.400> start<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> note<00:04:25.180> before<00:04:25.390> you<00:04:25.840> could

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
could start on the note before you could

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:41.499 
could start on the note before you could
move<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.320> up<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.710> whole<00:04:26.920> step<00:04:27.190> for

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.879 

now<00:04:42.509> we<00:04:42.569> can<00:04:42.779> apply<00:04:42.869> the<00:04:43.110> same<00:04:43.289> tapped

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
now we can apply the same tapped

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.760 
now we can apply the same tapped
extension<00:04:44.699> note<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:45.449> any<00:04:45.629> arpeggio<00:04:46.289> so<00:04:46.559> let's

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
extension note to any arpeggio so let's

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.119 
extension note to any arpeggio so let's
do<00:04:46.979> it

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
do it

00:04:47.129 --> 00:05:12.249 
do it
with<00:04:47.399> the<00:04:47.550> major<00:04:47.819> shapes<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:48.779> we<00:04:48.899> have<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.289> major

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.619 

now<00:05:13.259> we<00:05:13.319> can<00:05:13.589> also<00:05:13.740> use<00:05:14.249> this<00:05:14.729> extension<00:05:15.240> on

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
now we can also use this extension on

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.860 
now we can also use this extension on
another<00:05:16.520> variation<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.699> an<00:05:18.089> a<00:05:18.210> major<00:05:18.449> arpeggio

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
another variation of an a major arpeggio

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.429 
another variation of an a major arpeggio
and<00:05:19.199> it's<00:05:19.559> this<00:05:19.770> shape<00:05:19.830> here<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:24.659> again<00:05:25.229> I

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
and it's this shape here and again I

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.159 
and it's this shape here and again I
don't<00:05:25.770> have<00:05:26.009> any<00:05:26.370> problem<00:05:26.999> playing<00:05:27.749> these

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
don't have any problem playing these

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.709 
don't have any problem playing these
arpeggios<00:05:28.409> with<00:05:29.159> my<00:05:29.550> pick<00:05:29.819> over<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.509> fret

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
arpeggios with my pick over the fret

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.019 
arpeggios with my pick over the fret
board<00:05:30.749> because<00:05:31.559> it<00:05:31.860> really<00:05:32.370> doesn't<00:05:32.759> sound

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
board because it really doesn't sound

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.429 
board because it really doesn't sound
that<00:05:33.330> much<00:05:33.479> different<00:05:33.959> you're<00:05:34.080> really

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
that much different you're really

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.829 
that much different you're really
