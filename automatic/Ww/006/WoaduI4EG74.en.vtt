00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 is 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.469
 the medion taxi arrives at the end of 2009 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.779
 an unmanned pc with tax allows you to watch a movie on the internet 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.529
 record watch everything you want it sounds like the ideal press 7 in the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 living room but it makes its promises come true 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 from 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 Pine tree 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.110
 The big advantage of the Netherlands is also an all-in-one system, we see 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.539
 therefore mainly by components such as this 60 watt 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.649
 four gigabytes of ddr3 and even a built-in TV card 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is striking that you go for brick 40 and who comes with demos and even TV 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.620
 channels look to the finish 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.890
 nice with that the youngest bluray player who also burns against this 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.440
 but of course much more is possible 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.080
 so we see a bit of entry 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.300
 and pensions further that something 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.550
 fortunately with it also thought of the necessary entrance a hit another HDMI 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.770
 inputs sweep year and even cat 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.320
 Fortunately, it is also true that the necessary outputs make another HDMI 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.390
 output to and sp has set for digital 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.040
 of course it is not just a rose scent and moonshine with the medion 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.960
 taxis, for example, we think the speaker is not powerful enough because of the screen 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.010
 the wise and usually included behind than for example sweden race in buinen 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.210
 with headphones on your head of the eu stars to understand 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 also find the tv connections behind the screen 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.579
 this means dvs need a smart card reader and this for free 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.449
 included and therefore the one man solution 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.999
 just no escaping 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.980
 for example, to be able to use digitenne, a candle would be needed 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.870
 with scart must connect to the screen and so you still have a box that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.219
 The biggest disadvantage of a Netherlands is still is 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.359
 almost fifteen hundred euros is quite expensive 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.479
 I also for less money the 40 in shock for eating the cattle and one wields 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.149
 the scp is also faster 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.809
 As far as we are concerned, the Netherlands can simply leave the entire bag element 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.239
 no one gets up from the couch to erase scenes on his tv so it is 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.409
 actually no more than a gimmick but quite expensive 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.269
 the media with actions to make the voice a fun initiative 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.680
 yet it seems the tax element is not to touch the added value escapes us 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.879
 Just a bit 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.869
 very nice for mobile that farc is like the ipod 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:02.870
 probably fall 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.099
 godmothers and 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.530
 but with a 24 in screen it is just not very useful 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.749
 officially too scared with a keyboard a remote control or is it a table 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.299
 to work on such a screen 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.120
 and I have the fingerprints of the damage being tired 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.579
 it's just not that handy 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.509
 valuing man often made a nice gimmick partly because also very expensive 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.319
 use well
