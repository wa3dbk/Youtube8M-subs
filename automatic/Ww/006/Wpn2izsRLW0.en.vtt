00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.580
 why 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.080
 I like it 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.780
 all right 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.600
 in the year 2004 valls released the expected 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.520
 half life 2 for pc following the guidelines 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.530
 that marked the first delivery what 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.170
 we had in our hands was again 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.329
 a great shooter in capital letters that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.430
 told an even more compelling story 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.559
 than the previous one while presenting 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.540
 new puzzles an evolved use of 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.879
 the physical and new and dangerous 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.489
 enemies that added to the already 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.650
 acquaintances having agreed to work 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.769
 for chimán we woke up in a long 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.280
 period of hibernation and nothing was like 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.229
 we remember it 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 in fact we woke up in a place called 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 17 city dominated like other cities 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.390
 by the alliance alien creatures 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 in its eagerness to dominate the world arriving 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 to the earth with the hope of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 transform us literally into part of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 your boss soon we find 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.420
 old friends all of them members of the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.119
 resistance whose leadership 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.830
 we would assume with the passage of the game 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.590
 our inseparable help lever 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.350
 álex and jáder and vans followed two props 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 basic of this game recognized by the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.259
 criticism as one of the best shooters 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.440
 of all times I was surprised that 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.390
 although the graphic section was really 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.520
 excellent the technical requirements not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 they were very demanding can not be played 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.890
 even in mid- range computers 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.659
 low all the sections were great and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.170
 we can only indicate that as 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.149
 critics and as gamers we have never again 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 had such a good varied experience 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.780
 and deep like the one he offered us in his 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.119
 half life day 2 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.940
 The original PC game includes a new 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.980
 counter strike chapter something he did 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.170
 go crazy over more than one for the complete 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.780
 that this album was one of the first 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.360
 dvd games that appeared for pc 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.000
 but this chapter of sensation history 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.170
 also verses about orange box 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.209
 compilation that electronic arts edited 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.870
 three years later in particular in the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.870
 year 2007 for playstation 3 xbox 360 and 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.050
 pc this compilation offers to the chapter 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 original of half-life 2 chapters 1 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.690
 and 2 that were launched in 2006 and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 2007 respectively and that they offered us 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.100
 new stories linked in part to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.160
 original chapter the multiplayer team 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.959
 fortress 2 and the portal debut a game 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.269
 of puzzles in which we had to open 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.120
 portals to leave rooms 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.769
 closed a compilation that currently 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.160
 can still be found in a lot of 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.220
 steam shops or on demand on xbox 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.950
 live 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.950
 it is recommendable combination was revealed 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.080
 like the super pack of half life 2 what 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.150
 only criticizable was that in consoles 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.250
 reappear those males of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.770
 seconds to load the zones or check 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.960
 points and that the deliveries do not come in 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.670
 bent or located as if they did 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.090
 I started deliveries in format 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.890
 individual even to this day still 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.780
 they wait for news that I had 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.510
 to be the third chapter of half-life 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.020
 2 that had to have premiered years 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.390
 back although at this point and gives us 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.720
 we prefer to hear from 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:43.209
 half-life 3 and in the next chapter 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.209
 we reviewed gears of war 2
