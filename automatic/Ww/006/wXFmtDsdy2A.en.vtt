00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 given the great interest that the diet 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 high protein is arousing among the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 young people and in particular among the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.500
 sportsmen today have well thought of offering you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.590
 a dish that I myself formulated is a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.990
 my opinion is very good very filling 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.150
 and naturally protein or to prepare 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.939
 a whole in a protein yochi with le 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.750
 potatoes that will come later 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.640
 enriched with proteins 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 concentrated soy but can be 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.449
 also use other types of proteins 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.970
 such as whey proteins 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 of milk then to increase a little bit 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 still the protein share we will go to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.059
 work well with an album 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.870
 and that as we know is a source of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.460
 protein 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 so let's find out what the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 doses of ingredients to prepare 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 protein eyes ingredients for three 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.170
 four portions then we have 500 g of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 Farnese potatoes 100 g of white flour of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 type 00 40 grams of protein 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.719
 concentrated soy a new where 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.510
 we will only use the album air and then 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.150
 salt just enough for the sauce 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 instead we use cheese 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.970
 gorgonzola about 80 grams 30 grams of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 walnut kernels and thirty years of liter 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.729
 of milk we first put in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.790
 boil a saucepan with water where 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.009
 then we will go to cook the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.200
 our york then we put a 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 smaller pan for the bain-marie 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.560
 where we will go here to dissolve the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.770
 gorgonzola with milk then again 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.810
 we have steamed the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 our peeled potatoes after having them 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 clearly well washed under water 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.130
 current 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.899
 I which have already blossomed now vi 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.600
 I show, however, it is very simple 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.149
 I recommend peeling the operation 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.790
 still hot maybe mundi munitevi of 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.180
 gloves for which burn so many 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.420
 they protect a little from the heat of the potatoes 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.560
 here then with the knife maybe 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.340
 we remove the parts a little in the case 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:09.280
 were it is ok and now we can proceed 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 as usual to the classic 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:20.020
 the potato dictatorship here is here and then 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.790
 let those who are cool cool down 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.770
 we were waiting for the potatoes to come 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.450
 cooled down a little we put 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 inside the small pot in the bathroom 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.950
 maria the gorgonzola cut into small pieces 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 so that it melts slowly 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 later we will also add the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.400
 milk to make a creamy sauce now 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.110
 our potatoes have cooled because 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.569
 simply let it cool 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.209
 because otherwise if we had used 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.120
 right away and the hot potatoes would have 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.070
 required a lot of flour and he or 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.519
 capital would be very hard 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.400
 now let's add the salt because we have it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:00.519
 steamed so we don't have them 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.380
 salted then we also add the album with 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.989
 the source of protein that will also serve 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.000
 a bit elegant in this case all of them 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.080
 concentrated soy proteins that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.030
 I remind you that you can safely 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.950
 replace with whey proteins 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.340
 of milk always neutral taste mi 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.920
 I recommend and then we start to knead 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:24.130
 so at this point we can add 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.070
 already the flour part how much 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.440
 enough to get a dough that is 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.570
 it has in itself one of the right consistency 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.640
 I can not give you the precise dose of 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.280
 I gave you 100 grams of flour 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.560
 things just approximate because 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.540
 depends on the type of potatoes I went to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.370
 also use from the temperature with 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.370
 which then go to knead the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.310
 so everything is the amount of flour it is 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 influenced by many factors 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.489
 so we knead until you get a 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.500
 nice compact stake as I told you 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.340
 we got a nice compact stake 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.250
 and now we can also proceed to do 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.810
 of the classic cylinders and then we'll go to 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.810
 get child who who 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.730
 we have made 4 cords I am 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.680
 making the cut to make eyes 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.620
 what you were seeing is very simple 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.860
 make them remind you briefly how to do them 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.100
 so take a small piece between the two 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.140
 hands make the ball and then if you have 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.870
 you can even draw eyes 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.960
 clearly faster pass the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.620
 draw and do the classic lines neither 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.380
 of gnocchi 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.740
 if instead you have little time you can too 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.380
 just make balls and you 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.180
 then make them directly in the water 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.820
 we proceed in this way up to 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.920
 run out all the dumplings underneath 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.690
 suggestion of the best of st 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.690
 and I recommend this point to do 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.990
 just the stripes because under her 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.720
 suggestion says that the sauce the human le 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.460
 more attached than it is also true to 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 example when you go to choose the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.100
 always prefer the tied pasta 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.260
 just because the human sub more 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.710
 attacked so let's do these as well 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.650
 rigid now that we have prepared and 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.020
 striped all eyes we can 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.030
 proceed with the cooking first but there is 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.830
 I show that here the gorgonzola is 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.990
 melted perfectly slowly 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.440
 so gently we can add 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.230
 also milk with the bela krajina that 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.860
 we leave you 6 mar bain marie very well a 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.540
 this point we salted the water e 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.970
 we can proceed to cheat 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.919
 gently our dumplings when 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.780
 they will emerge ready 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 I always recommend a nice fire 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.940
 sustained because the water must boil 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.620
 otherwise the dumpling could be 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.960
 even smash if too much remains 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.210
 long inside the water e 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.990
 we proceed in this way with all the 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.810
 gnocchi you see now the gnocchi are 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.850
 we have already surfaced in the meantime we have 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.390
 also transferred ours ours 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.250
 gorgonzola sauce on a pan 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.810
 now we can easily recline 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.810
 all our eyes 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.370
 so here we do this 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.020
 operation until all of them are exhausted 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.849
 ingredients 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.949
 here are the protein gnocchi al 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.930
 gorgonzola are ready analyzing 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.449
 quick nutritional tables 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.599
 we realize how much protein 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.660
 are greater in this respect plate 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.000
 clearly to a traditional dish of 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.639
 dumplings if you don't particularly like the 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.349
 gorgonzola you can safely 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.389
 replace it with a very simple sauce 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.910
 such as a tomato sauce 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.280
 and basil in the latter case also the 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.110
 calories will be significantly lower and 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.190
 high for the tension always continue
