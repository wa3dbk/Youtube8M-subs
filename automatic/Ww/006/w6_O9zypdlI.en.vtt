00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
with Wi-Fi in it and so that doesn't

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
with Wi-Fi in it and so that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:02.100> sound<00:02:02.640> exciting<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.240> its<00:02:03.390> own

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
necessarily sound exciting on its own

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.090 
necessarily sound exciting on its own
because<00:02:03.869> we're<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.259> used<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> having<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
because we're really used to having that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310 
because we're really used to having that
with<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.579> our<00:02:05.700> devices<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.170> can

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
with all of our devices but you can

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.809 
with all of our devices but you can
actually<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.250> cool<00:02:08.429> stuff<00:02:08.489> with

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually do some really cool stuff with

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.729 
actually do some really cool stuff with
this<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.780> download<00:02:10.020> an<00:02:10.319> app<00:02:10.470> from

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this you can download an app from

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.720 
this you can download an app from

basically control this camera from your
device<00:02:16.379> which<00:02:17.099> means<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:17.879> remotely<00:02:18.620> do

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
device which means you can remotely do

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.449 
device which means you can remotely do
autofocus<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.430> set<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> white<00:02:21.269> balance<00:02:21.300> or

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
autofocus or set the white balance or

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.190 
autofocus or set the white balance or
geotag<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.510> many<00:02:24.629> things<00:02:24.750> with

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
geotag you can do so many things with

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.339 
geotag you can do so many things with
this<00:02:25.349> camera<00:02:25.790> remotely<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.300> can<00:02:27.810> even<00:02:27.989> set

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
this camera remotely so you can even set

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.589 
this camera remotely so you can even set
the<00:02:28.380> intervalometer<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.209> leave<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
the intervalometer you can leave the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.479 
the intervalometer you can leave the
camera<00:02:30.930> outside<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> shoot<00:02:31.620> time-lapse<00:02:32.130> of

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
camera outside and shoot time-lapse of

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.740 
camera outside and shoot time-lapse of
star<00:02:32.730> trails<00:02:33.030> while<00:02:33.209> you're<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.599> house

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
star trails while you're in your house

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.630 
star trails while you're in your house

watching the game that's great you can

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.610 
watching the game that's great you can
totally<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.060> cool<00:02:36.269> stuff<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
totally do cool stuff with this the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.100 
totally do cool stuff with this the
olympus<00:02:37.980> EP<00:02:38.340> 5<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.790> super<00:02:39.239> fast<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.870> got<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
olympus EP 5 is super fast it's got a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.380 
olympus EP 5 is super fast it's got a
mechanical<00:02:40.739> shutter<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.310> shoots<00:02:41.910> at<00:02:42.120> one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
mechanical shutter that shoots at one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.030 
mechanical shutter that shoots at one
8,000th<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> second

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
8,000th of a second

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.370 
8,000th of a second
now<00:02:44.430> most<00:02:44.700> consumer<00:02:45.299> cameras<00:02:45.810> only<00:02:46.080> go<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> one

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
now most consumer cameras only go to one

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.229 
now most consumer cameras only go to one
four<00:02:46.920> thousandth<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.580> second<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.090> it's

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
four thousandth of a second so it's

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.630 
four thousandth of a second so it's
twice<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.690> fast<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.739> means<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.220> couple<00:02:50.430> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
twice as fast and that means a couple of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.819 
twice as fast and that means a couple of
things<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> those<00:02:51.930> things<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> it's

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
things one of those things is that it's

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.140 
things one of those things is that it's
going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> allow<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.519> compensate<00:02:53.940> in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
going to allow you to compensate in

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.449 
going to allow you to compensate in
broad<00:02:54.720> daylight<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.829> you'll<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.190> able<00:02:56.250> to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
broad daylight so you'll be able to

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.580 
broad daylight so you'll be able to
balance<00:02:56.640> out<00:02:56.910> your<00:02:56.940> exposures<00:02:57.630> with<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
balance out your exposures with that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.559 
balance out your exposures with that
extra<00:02:58.950> sunlight<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.579> go<00:03:00.000> outside<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> get

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
extra sunlight and go outside and get

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.229 
extra sunlight and go outside and get
great<00:03:00.780> shots<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.560> its<00:03:02.069> really<00:03:02.280> fast<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.000> say

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
great shots and its really fast so say

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.490 
great shots and its really fast so say
there's<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.540> new<00:03:03.569> scale<00:03:03.870> helicopter<00:03:04.349> outside

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
there's a new scale helicopter outside

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.110 
there's a new scale helicopter outside
something's<00:03:05.250> going<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.910> want<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
something's going on that you want to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.300 
something's going on that you want to
get<00:03:06.209> pictures<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.599> well<00:03:07.440> those<00:03:07.709> helicopter

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
get pictures of well those helicopter

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.979 
get pictures of well those helicopter
blades<00:03:08.549> are<00:03:08.760> gonna<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.150> taxed<00:03:09.599> sharp<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
blades are gonna be taxed sharp and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.330 
blades are gonna be taxed sharp and
frozen<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.650> your<00:03:10.739> picture<00:03:11.069> if<00:03:11.220> you're

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
frozen in your picture if you're

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.800 
frozen in your picture if you're
shooting<00:03:11.549> at<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.910> eight<00:03:12.120> thousandth<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.720> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
shooting at one eight thousandth of a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.650 
shooting at one eight thousandth of a
second<00:03:13.200> does<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.130> cool<00:03:14.400> stuff<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.480> other

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
second does very cool stuff the other

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.990 
second does very cool stuff the other
thing<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.109> does<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.590> syncs<00:03:17.100> with<00:03:17.280> flash<00:03:17.579> at

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
thing it does is it syncs with flash at

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.150 
thing it does is it syncs with flash at
one<00:03:18.420> three<00:03:18.750> twentieth<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.470> second<00:03:19.859> and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
one three twentieth of a second and

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.370 
one three twentieth of a second and
again<00:03:20.459> most<00:03:21.000> consumer<00:03:21.569> cameras<00:03:21.989> only<00:03:22.109> go<00:03:22.319> to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
again most consumer cameras only go to

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
again most consumer cameras only go to
about<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.950> one<00:03:23.190> two<00:03:23.400> hundredth<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.030> second

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
about like one two hundredth of a second

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
about like one two hundredth of a second
so<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:25.319> much<00:03:25.500> faster<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.819> means

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
so it's much faster and what that means

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.120 
so it's much faster and what that means
for<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.200> built-in<00:03:28.470> flash<00:03:28.650> which

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
for you is with the built-in flash which

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.250 
for you is with the built-in flash which
will<00:03:29.280> pop<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.459> right<00:03:29.639> here<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.780> can<00:03:30.930> actually

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
will pop up right here you can actually

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.870 
will pop up right here you can actually
kind<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.590> rid<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.799> all<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.250> ambient

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
kind of get rid of all of that ambient

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.670 
kind of get rid of all of that ambient
light<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.269> your<00:03:33.359> scene<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:34.049> focus<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.590> on

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
light in your scene and just focus in on

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.059 
light in your scene and just focus in on
