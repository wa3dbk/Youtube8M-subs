00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
the downtown drift area um I think we're

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.140 
the downtown drift area um I think we're
gonna<00:00:51.850> go<00:00:52.059> for<00:00:52.300> hard<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:52.780> time

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
gonna go for hard this time

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.819 
gonna go for hard this time
in<00:00:55.150> which<00:00:55.239> case<00:00:55.449> that<00:00:55.480> also<00:00:55.750> what<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.470> think<00:00:56.710> in

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
in which case that also what I think in

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.290 
in which case that also what I think in
which<00:00:56.890> case<00:00:57.129> that<00:00:57.159> also<00:00:57.519> represents<00:00:58.000> how<00:00:58.120> many

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
which case that also represents how many

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.910 
which case that also represents how many
stars<00:00:58.659> you<00:00:58.780> get<00:00:59.019> so<00:00:59.170> if<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.409> do<00:00:59.559> it<00:00:59.680> on<00:00:59.769> medium

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
stars you get so if you do it on medium

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.740 
stars you get so if you do it on medium
mode<00:01:00.280> then<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.579> get<00:01:00.699> two<00:01:00.879> stars<00:01:01.149> easy<00:01:01.540> mode

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
mode then you get two stars easy mode

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.560 
mode then you get two stars easy mode
one<00:01:01.989> star<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.769> you<00:01:02.949> it<00:01:03.129> on<00:01:03.250> hard<00:01:03.519> mode<00:01:03.640> then<00:01:04.330> you

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
one star if you it on hard mode then you

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.000 
one star if you it on hard mode then you
get<00:01:04.750> three<00:01:04.960> stars<00:01:05.369> okay<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.799> we're
