my favorite part about this shirt has to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.049 
my favorite part about this shirt has to
be<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> hemline<00:00:14.040> because<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> has<00:00:14.639> these<00:00:14.820> two

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
be the hemline because it has these two

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.700 
be the hemline because it has these two
panels<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> back<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.900> allow<00:00:16.350> some<00:00:16.590> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
panels in the back that allow some of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.769 
panels in the back that allow some of
your<00:00:16.830> back<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.250> peek<00:00:17.460> through<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> first

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
your back to peek through so the first

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300 
your back to peek through so the first
way<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.170> would<00:00:19.289> wear<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.070> pair<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
way that I would wear this is to pair it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
way that I would wear this is to pair it
with<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.520> leather<00:00:20.760> bustier<00:00:21.060> beneath<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
with a leather bustier beneath it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
with a leather bustier beneath it
because<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> size<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.310> back<00:00:23.609> will<00:00:23.850> allow

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
because the size in the back will allow

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.670 
because the size in the back will allow
a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> peek<00:00:25.230> through<00:00:25.260> which

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a little bit of it to peek through which

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:38.660 
a little bit of it to peek through which
i<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.130> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> sexy<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.090> awesome

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.620 

the<00:00:39.670> other<00:00:39.850> way<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.090> can<00:00:40.270> wear<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.510> with

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
the other way you can wear it with

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.930 
the other way you can wear it with
leather<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.290> to<00:00:41.560> wear<00:00:41.890> leather<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.610> bottom

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
leather is to wear leather on the bottom

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.790 
leather is to wear leather on the bottom
so<00:00:43.180> these<00:00:43.330> are<00:00:43.510> some<00:00:43.750> shorts<00:00:43.960> from<00:00:44.260> forever<00:00:44.560> 21

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
so these are some shorts from forever 21

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.950 
so these are some shorts from forever 21
and<00:00:45.130> I<00:00:45.400> just<00:00:45.640> love<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.940> contrast<00:00:46.360> between<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
and I just love the contrast between the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.110 
and I just love the contrast between the
heart<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.560> the<00:00:47.680> leather<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.430> soft<00:00:48.700> of<00:00:48.940> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
heart of the leather and the soft of the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:06.540 
heart of the leather and the soft of the
feminine<00:00:49.570> shirt

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.860
