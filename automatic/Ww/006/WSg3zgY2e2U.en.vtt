 the PTs are about 130 thousand 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.949
 open positions 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.840

 drivers but this one choose one 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.869
 another path 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.170

 in the truck without standing upright people 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 can get sick in the handle the bank there 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 It puts you in the right position 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 always adjusted steering wheel 45 degrees 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.809

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.379
 This is for everyone now to drive. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.860
 a stork truck needs 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.360
 specialization fat ox closed the space 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 ideal for you to have re-recording 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 work at final destination 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 I put this car here but it's missing one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.369
 little for you to have lateral access 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 amazing cool coast 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 these pistons I left at the time 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.549
 Not for the car, I thought. 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 with the vehicle 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.170
 this also define which courses and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.310
 free of making modern trucks 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 are very comfortable large booths 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 panels full of buttons and much 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.680
 the person has to continue 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.750
 knowing how to drive but it is fundamental that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.329
 also with this technology he knows 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 how the whole systemic panel 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.470
 beyond the truck that the computer 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.810
 automatic pilot light with anti 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 collision but the truck went alone 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.909
 when he approaches another one 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.890
 Obstacle still has electronic tachograph 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.749
 tracking to learn how to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.460
 using the new champions has a lot 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.460
 driver going to class 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.329
 in these specialization courses the basic 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.090
 is as important as technology 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.110
 before putting the vehicle into service. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.599
 operation 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 we must check all conditions 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.090
 vehicle as a visual check list 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.879
 make from there to tire for 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 check if they are in perfect condition 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.440
 operating conditions that we 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.459
 we should always be doing before 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.459
 get the vehicle moving 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.700
 in 2012 the driver's law limited the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.099
 number of hours of work at the wheel 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.959
 security that becomes the 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.430
 hope for a better life 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.349

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.810

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.910
 In this time, what you have already achieved 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.170
 I conquered my own house. 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.079
 I change cars every two years. 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.030

 I started working as a helper of 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.450
 valet to be able to reach a level 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.790
 best 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.620
 if you still doubt it's better 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.959
 listen to who already is of the passage 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.730

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.310
