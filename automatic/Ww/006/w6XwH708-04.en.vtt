miles an hour so I'm looking forward to
just<00:00:46.190> trialing<00:00:47.000> how<00:00:47.120> my<00:00:47.299> car<00:00:47.540> handles<00:00:48.049> a<00:00:48.170> bit

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
just trialing how my car handles a bit

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.590 
just trialing how my car handles a bit
more<00:00:48.920> over<00:00:49.549> the<00:00:49.640> speed<00:00:49.909> limit<00:00:49.940> maybe<00:00:50.360> like

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
more over the speed limit maybe like

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.530 
more over the speed limit maybe like
some<00:00:50.780> triple<00:00:51.080> figures<00:00:51.260> or<00:00:51.559> whatever<00:00:52.390> but<00:00:53.390> it's

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
some triple figures or whatever but it's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.090 
some triple figures or whatever but it's
also<00:00:53.659> going<00:00:53.869> to<00:00:53.930> be<00:00:54.049> a<00:00:54.080> chance<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.530> see<00:00:54.830> cars

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
like this attempt to reach 200 miles an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.100 
like this attempt to reach 200 miles an
hour<00:00:58.729> which<00:00:58.909> i<00:00:59.000> think<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.330> Tim's<00:00:59.629> goal<00:00:59.900> from

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250 
whether the Autobahn means the D
restricted<00:02:12.550> bits<00:02:12.760> or<00:02:13.000> whether<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.450> means

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
restricted bits or whether it just means

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.949 
restricted bits or whether it just means
a<00:02:14.319> motorway<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.189> general<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.700> think<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.180> us<00:02:16.360> so

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
a motorway in general I think it us so

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.840 
a motorway in general I think it us so
we're<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.650> first<00:02:17.920> Autobahn

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.540 

of<00:02:20.940> course<00:02:21.240> not<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> whole<00:02:22.320> Autobahn<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.190> just

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
of course not the whole Autobahn is just

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.940 
of course not the whole Autobahn is just
go<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.120> fast<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.600> want<00:02:24.780> they<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.350> made<00:02:25.740> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
go as fast if you want they have made it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.120 
go as fast if you want they have made it
quite<00:02:26.820> safe<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.660> some<00:02:28.350> parts

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
quite safe in some parts

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
quite safe in some parts
so<00:02:29.790> we're<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.360> cruising<00:02:30.750> now<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> speed

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
so we're just cruising now at the speed

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.280 
so we're just cruising now at the speed

can<00:02:37.950> slow<00:02:38.220> down<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> bit

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
can slow down a bit

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
can slow down a bit
wait<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.720> them<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.710> them<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.280> get

passed that's it
unrestricted<00:02:44.230> speeds<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.099> we're<00:02:45.849> just

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
unrestricted speeds so we're just

I've still got a good two and a half

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.450 
I've still got a good two and a half
hours<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.310> go<00:05:48.490> before<00:05:48.700> we<00:05:49.570> arrive<00:05:49.870> in<00:05:50.080> Cologne

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.430 

that<00:05:53.970> wasn't<00:05:54.120> where<00:05:54.330> this<00:05:54.479> album<00:05:54.900> police<00:05:55.169> car

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
that wasn't where this album police car

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.460 
that wasn't where this album police car
over<00:05:55.740> but<00:05:56.400> yeah<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.300> is<00:05:57.360> just<00:05:57.690> not<00:05:57.840> fun<00:05:58.050> in

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
over but yeah this is just not fun in

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.820 
over but yeah this is just not fun in
the<00:05:58.620> slightest

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.149 

so<00:06:02.659> the<00:06:03.659> best<00:06:03.990> run<00:06:04.199> was<00:06:04.379> in<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.560> morning<00:06:04.919> but<00:06:05.129> I

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
so the best run was in the morning but I

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.170 
so the best run was in the morning but I
think<00:06:05.400> we're<00:06:05.490> going<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.669> be<00:06:05.759> doing<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.030> bit<00:06:06.150> of

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
think we're going to be doing a bit of

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.469 
think we're going to be doing a bit of
Autobahn<00:06:06.840> on<00:06:07.139> Sunday<00:06:08.039> heading<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.789> Brussels

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
Autobahn on Sunday heading to Brussels

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.120 
Autobahn on Sunday heading to Brussels
in<00:06:09.720> Belgium

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.710 

so<00:06:13.430> fingers<00:06:13.760> crossed<00:06:14.000> we<00:06:14.120> get<00:06:14.240> a<00:06:14.330> good<00:06:14.510> run

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
so fingers crossed we get a good run

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.180 
so fingers crossed we get a good run
then<00:06:14.930> because<00:06:15.230> I'm<00:06:15.350> just<00:06:15.530> completely<00:06:15.950> wiped

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
then because I'm just completely wiped

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.800 
then because I'm just completely wiped
out

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.520 

more<00:06:19.810> than<00:06:20.169> 15<00:06:20.800> miles<00:06:21.099> an<00:06:21.370> hour

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
more than 15 miles an hour

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.860 
more than 15 miles an hour
and<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.860> cars<00:06:23.070> in<00:06:23.280> front<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.670> what<00:06:23.850> we<00:06:23.970> doing

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
and the cars in front of what we doing

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.040 
and the cars in front of what we doing
front<00:06:26.140> is<00:06:26.260> not<00:06:26.440> doing<00:06:26.800> anything

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.840 

so<00:06:30.650> hopefully<00:06:31.070> I'll<00:06:31.190> get<00:06:31.340> some<00:06:31.520> more<00:06:31.640> footage
