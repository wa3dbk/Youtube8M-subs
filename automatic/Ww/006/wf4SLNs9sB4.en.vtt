00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
done so that's something that I'm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.610 
done so that's something that I'm
looking<00:03:07.300> at<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.450> now<00:03:07.630> because<00:03:08.230> they're

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
looking at right now because they're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.950 
looking at right now because they're
absolutely<00:03:09.100> unwearable<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.300> still<00:03:10.660> love

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
absolutely unwearable but I still love

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.360 
absolutely unwearable but I still love
them<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.470> that's<00:03:12.280> what<00:03:12.460> they<00:03:12.550> look<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:12.790> on

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
them and that's what they look like on

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.190 
them and that's what they look like on
but<00:03:15.370> they're<00:03:15.550> pretty<00:03:15.880> badly<00:03:16.209> scratched<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
but they're pretty badly scratched and

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.590 
but they're pretty badly scratched and
you're<00:03:17.290> actually<00:03:17.440> not<00:03:17.770> supposed<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.250> wear

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you're actually not supposed to wear

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.150 
you're actually not supposed to wear
glasses<00:03:19.600> or<00:03:20.050> sunglasses<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.620> are<00:03:20.709> scratched

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
glasses or sunglasses that are scratched

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680 
glasses or sunglasses that are scratched
because<00:03:21.340> that's<00:03:21.670> really<00:03:21.940> bad<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.510> your<00:03:22.630> eyes

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because that's really bad for your eyes

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
because that's really bad for your eyes
so<00:03:23.050> I'm<00:03:23.140> definitely<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:24.040> get<00:03:24.190> these

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
fixed before I wear them again so that's

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.729
