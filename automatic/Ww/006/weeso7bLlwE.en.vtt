00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi all guys today i will explain to you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.269
 how to find the snow fortress and the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.070
 seedlings for making spells 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 let's go there it is certain that it takes a while 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 land time to find the fortress 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 inter because it's not easy at least 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.439
 I find that luck immediately but not 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.439
 it often happens 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.719
 then why don't you fly 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:01:03.519
 then now we go in search of the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:01:04.420
 bard fortress boys moment of 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.690
 glory 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 I found the fortress of the weather there 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.680
 took so long 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.869
 now I'll do a little exploring why me 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 like and let's find the entrance if 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.759
 finds her a fortune transforms into 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.990
 series to if luck finds us so if there 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:37.119
 I am already inside and I enter here I do 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:39.340
 see I show how and where are the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.610
 seedlings for making spells are 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.350
 these are the red ones 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.270
 seedlings are found only in 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.799
 put only in the fortress from 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.750
 anything 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.429
 now I can't find them why not 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.869
 I'm just a creative toilet bowl and these 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.450
 seedlings that only succeed on 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.910
 this land that the land of never does not 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.319
 I know what it's called precisely but this one 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.530
 here is a land that blocks you 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.539
 character look block my 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 character walk 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.190
 if not you if you want to do spells 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.500
 this is the map to get the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.640
 you just have to go to the meter to have 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.760
 luck and find a fortress now a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 explores a bit in short, it's all not so 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.569
 a great deal to see, of course, very great 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.650
 big very big and that's all 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.650
 made with bricks from the goals 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:52.930
 and type a giant temple extends over 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:03:00.220
 most of the leaders are truly one 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.540

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.599
