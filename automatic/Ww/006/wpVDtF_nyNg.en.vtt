using the jacquard textile color

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.250 
using the jacquard textile color
I<00:03:57.489> think<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.180> leaves<00:03:58.420> up<00:03:58.599> feeling<00:03:58.900> nice<00:03:59.019> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
I think this leaves up feeling nice and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.930 
I think this leaves up feeling nice and
soft<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.590> lasts<00:03:59.799> really<00:03:59.980> long<00:04:00.129> time<00:04:00.489> just<00:04:00.760> make

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
soft it lasts really long time just make

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.789 
soft it lasts really long time just make
sure<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.510> whatever<00:04:02.080> paint<00:04:02.470> you're<00:04:02.590> using

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
sure that whatever paint you're using

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.070 
sure that whatever paint you're using
will<00:04:03.700> work<00:04:03.879> with<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.299> material<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:04.870> you're

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
will work with the material that you're

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.289 
will work with the material that you're
using<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.310> fine<00:04:06.519> for<00:04:06.549> natural<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
using so this is fine for natural and

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.449 
using so this is fine for natural and
synthetic<00:04:07.450> fibers<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.829> basically<00:04:09.220> what<00:04:09.400> I'm

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
synthetic fibers so basically what I'm

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.619 
synthetic fibers so basically what I'm
going<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.610> do<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.090> going<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.269> pick<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:10.599> a

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
going to do is I'm going to pick up a

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.330 
going to do is I'm going to pick up a
little<00:04:10.930> bit<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.409> paint<00:04:11.799> onto<00:04:12.159> my<00:04:12.730> sponge<00:04:13.150> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
little bit of paint onto my sponge and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.219 
little bit of paint onto my sponge and
the<00:04:15.340> key<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:16.030> getting<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.630> nice<00:04:16.900> even

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
the key to getting a really nice even

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.020 
the key to getting a really nice even
application<00:04:17.440> without<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.669> bleeding

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
application without it bleeding

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.659 
application without it bleeding
underneath<00:04:19.449> your<00:04:19.720> stencil<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.400> kind<00:04:21.609> of

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
underneath your stencil is to kind of

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.860 
underneath your stencil is to kind of
stipple<00:04:21.910> some<00:04:22.300> off<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.210> go<00:04:25.360> in

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
stipple some off and I like to go in

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.590 
stipple some off and I like to go in
with<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.020> pretty<00:04:26.289> dry<00:04:26.650> sponge<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.430> just

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
with a pretty dry sponge and just

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.060 
with a pretty dry sponge and just
stipple<00:04:29.820> straight<00:04:30.820> up<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.120> down<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:32.070> this

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
stipple straight up and down and this

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.740 
stipple straight up and down and this
takes<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.520> little<00:04:33.789> bit<00:04:33.940> longer<00:04:34.150> cuz<00:04:34.539> you<00:04:34.600> can

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
takes a little bit longer cuz you can

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.640 
takes a little bit longer cuz you can
have<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.080> build<00:04:35.350> up<00:04:35.590> your<00:04:36.039> paint<00:04:37.380> but<00:04:38.380> in<00:04:38.470> this

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
have to build up your paint but in this

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.770 
have to build up your paint but in this
way<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.860> never<00:04:39.190> over<00:04:39.639> saturate<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.300> fabric

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
way you never over saturate the fabric

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.390 
way you never over saturate the fabric
and<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.110> never<00:04:41.260> bleeds<00:04:41.650> out<00:04:41.830> underneath<00:04:42.130> your

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
and it never bleeds out underneath your

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.700 
and it never bleeds out underneath your
stencil<00:04:42.789> and<00:04:43.110> hopefully<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.229> end<00:04:44.410> up<00:04:44.560> with

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
stencil and hopefully you end up with

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.100 
stencil and hopefully you end up with
nice<00:04:44.919> clean<00:04:45.340> edges<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:46.120> lines

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
nice clean edges and lines

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.520 
nice clean edges and lines

everything<00:05:36.820> together<00:05:37.060> I'm<00:05:37.810> just<00:05:38.020> going<00:05:38.139> to

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
everything together I'm just going to

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:49.560 
everything together I'm just going to
take<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.590> flat<00:05:39.039> or<00:05:39.340> angled<00:05:39.910> brush<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:49.389> usually

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
take a flat or angled brush you usually

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.689 
take a flat or angled brush you usually
get<00:05:49.900> cleaner<00:05:50.169> lines<00:05:50.440> if<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:50.830> peel<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.250> stencil

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
get cleaner lines if I peel the stencil

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.390 
get cleaner lines if I peel the stencil
off<00:05:51.820> right<00:05:52.180> away<00:05:52.740> but<00:05:53.740> where<00:05:53.919> this<00:05:54.070> was<00:05:54.220> such<00:05:54.370> a

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
off right away but where this was such a

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.730 
off right away but where this was such a
complex<00:05:54.880> design<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.630> was<00:05:55.810> nervous<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.259> do<00:05:56.560> that

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
complex design I was nervous to do that

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.159 
complex design I was nervous to do that
just<00:05:57.070> because<00:05:57.460> I<00:05:57.759> was<00:05:58.419> scared<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.870> was<00:05:58.990> going<00:05:59.080> to

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
just because I was scared I was going to

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.640 
just because I was scared I was going to
like<00:05:59.320> smear<00:06:00.220> paint<00:06:00.610> by<00:06:00.970> doing<00:06:01.300> it<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:02.560> if

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
like smear paint by doing it but if

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.230 
like smear paint by doing it but if
you're<00:06:02.770> doing<00:06:02.830> a<00:06:03.009> simpler<00:06:03.370> design<00:06:03.400> definitely

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
you're doing a simpler design definitely

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.360 
you're doing a simpler design definitely
try<00:06:04.509> that<00:06:04.750> because<00:06:05.139> I<00:06:05.229> do<00:06:05.289> I<00:06:05.620> have<00:06:05.860> had<00:06:06.099> better

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
try that because I do I have had better

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.279 
try that because I do I have had better
results<00:06:06.849> with<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.180> B<00:06:07.360> once<00:06:07.840> everything<00:06:08.259> is

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
results with that B once everything is

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.870 
results with that B once everything is
dry<00:06:08.590> make<00:06:09.099> sure<00:06:09.250> you<00:06:09.370> follow<00:06:09.639> the

dry make sure you follow the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.020 
dry make sure you follow the

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
instructions that are with the paint so

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.180

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229
