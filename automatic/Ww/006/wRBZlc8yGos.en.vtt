00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 and then there are the shoes clear because 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.150
 almost more important is that the clothes 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.319
 I still still look at nobody are the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.510
 shoes for many but good 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 fetishisms and syndromes up to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.009
 diogenes aside we all accumulate 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 footwear of all kinds without stopping and fixate 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.070
 Maria, if you are meeting someone 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
 or want to know more details of your partner 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 for example pay attention to footwear 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 because a report from the university of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.869
 kansas that would be with filippa and the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 footwear provides information 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 detailed up of the political ideas 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 from one let's go tell me how to fit and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.369
 I'll tell you who you are going to end up being 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.369
 true and he goes red 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.320
 They are reputed to be forgotten but they say 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.240
 more of you than you think according to a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.300
 study conducted by the university of 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.850
 Kansas shoes reflect 90% of their 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.530
 personality I think the shoe like 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 that the rest of the clothes in a language 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.059
 we communicate many times to 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.210
 through what we wear 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.220
 then they either reflect what we are and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.010
 what we want to become the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.080
 dancers I would propose or think 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
 that a person can carry 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.700
 let's say for example paula echeverrÃ­a 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.350
 everyone the insurance that knows her is 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.600
 a girl with a lot of style 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.910
 elegance very much to know to be I think it is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.520
 the right shoes for a girl is 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.920
 very today very current but that 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.530
 it has a lot of style the booty is a 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.420
 example of footwear especially that usually 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.479
 choose the person you want to mark 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.060
 some distance also that is a bit 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.700
 aggressive who also wants to prevail 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.009
 this type of shoe with the toe cap and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.200
 is a bit marked and a heel a 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.420
 little reel more or less high me 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.270
 I always associate it with very feminine girls 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.869
 very flirtatious 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 who like to seduce and for a 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.460
 girl that is very extroverted that does not 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.969
 like to spend nothing unnoticed and that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.219
 has an artist soul type lady gaga 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.780
 the ideal shoes are these mix 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.329
 platform heel prints 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 wild metalized and you what footwear 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.439
 takes and why 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.690
 the comfort first of all that all skin 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.180
 Well some sandals we are in summer 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.799
 light cool yes yes very comfortable in addition 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.930
 we can be a little tall and not by much 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.209
 heel and already on is something too 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 we discard the heels then or not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.190
 not not at all but for usual not and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.340
 What footwear do we wear? 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.660
 is one of almost all low 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.250
 comfortable and why are you wearing this kind of 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.870
 footwear that is customary throughout life and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.579
 he did not always take the fourth attack 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.060
 change not clear 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.340
 removing when the beach never changed 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.200
 there are those who have a couple of pairs but 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.480
 also those who make footwear their 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.770
 fetish how many pairs of shoes do you have 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.520
 at home why do you ask 50/50 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.730
 know between the two by and those to dress 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.680
 I think about 20 pairs of singers like 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 blond paulina or actresses like sarah 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.519
 Jessica Parker have recognized her 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.090
 addiction to shoes but they are not 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.610
 only addicts of addicts eye I think 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.640
 which is a trend also very 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.970
 male in the shoe because I 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.900
 I think they are very beautiful objects 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.480
 regardless of whether they help us 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.190
 walk and walk better there is no 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.709
 true works of art and true 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.959
 beauties then who does not like 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.299
 have something nice at home something nice 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.790
 who chooses if he thinks according to his 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.780
 personality surprises him then that 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.780
 say so much about you
