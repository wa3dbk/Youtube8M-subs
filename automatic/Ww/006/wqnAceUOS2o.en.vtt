canvas<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.890> looking<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
canvas because just looking at it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
canvas because just looking at it
straight<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> full

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
straight on you don't get the full

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.190 
straight on you don't get the full
effect<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.079> elements

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
