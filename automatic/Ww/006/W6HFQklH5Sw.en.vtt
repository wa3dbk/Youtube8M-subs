up<00:00:50.510> just<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.920> looks<00:00:53.520> like

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
up just because of I think it looks like

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.950 
up just because of I think it looks like
I<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.180> doing<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I could be doing that with a lot of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.619 
I could be doing that with a lot of
hands<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> did<00:00:55.860> steal<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> pot<00:00:56.629> especially

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
hands so I did steal the pot especially

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
hands so I did steal the pot especially
the<00:00:58.079> situation<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.010> where<00:00:59.039> no<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.399> has

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the situation like that where no one has

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
the situation like that where no one has
anything<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.390> he<00:01:01.050> raised<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
anything and he raised me and at that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.799 
anything and he raised me and at that
point<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.579> thought<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:03.090> basically<00:01:03.570> could

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
point I thought he basically could

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.570 
point I thought he basically could
either<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.189> trips<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:06.180> bluff<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.290> um<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.830> i

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
either have trips or a bluff so um so i

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.130 
either have trips or a bluff so um so i
called<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.240> he<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> bluffing<00:01:09.689> guess

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
called in case he was bluffing guess

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
called in case he was bluffing guess
you've<00:01:10.320> let<00:01:10.590> him<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:11.040> laughing<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.729> he

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you've let him keep laughing and if he

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
you've let him keep laughing and if he
has<00:01:11.970> trips<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.619> one

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
has trips I'm gonna get all just one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.870 
has trips I'm gonna get all just one
anyways<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:16.619> check<00:01:17.189> called<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> turn<00:01:17.670> which

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
anyways so I check called the turn which

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyways so I check called the turn which
was<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> five<00:01:18.360> same<00:01:18.960> reasoning<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.280> now

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
was a five same reasoning and then now

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
was a five same reasoning and then now
the<00:01:20.490> river<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> nine<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.650> like

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the river was a nine and then I was like

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
the river was a nine and then I was like
wow<00:01:23.360> no<00:01:24.360> he's<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.659> probably<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
wow no he's not probably not going to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
wow no he's not probably not going to
bluff<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.950> often<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.909> i

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
bluff me very often now because if i

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
bluff me very often now because if i
have<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.450> nine<00:01:27.479> ten<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.170> something<00:01:28.500> i<00:01:28.590> would

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
have like nine ten or something i would

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
have like nine ten or something i would
make<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> full<00:01:29.189> house<00:01:29.400> yeah<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.900> we're

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
make a full house yeah and so we're

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.319 
make a full house yeah and so we're
probably<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.380> check<00:01:31.650> behind<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:33.150> all

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
probably just check behind but I go all

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.539 
probably just check behind but I go all
in<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.170> maybe<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
in you know maybe here put me I'm like I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
in you know maybe here put me I'm like I
could<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> hand<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.659> pocket<00:01:37.020> eights<00:01:37.170> for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
could have a hand like pocket eights for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
could have a hand like pocket eights for
pocket<00:01:37.710> sevens<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.640> bluffing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pocket sevens and probably was bluffing

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
pocket sevens and probably was bluffing
all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.290> counterfeited<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
all the way now I got counterfeited so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
all the way now I got counterfeited so
it<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:42.090> look<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.509> making<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it could look like I'm making a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
it could look like I'm making a
desperation<00:01:43.200> bluff<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> maybe<00:01:44.040> he<00:01:44.280> would

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
desperation bluff and maybe he would

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.850 
desperation bluff and maybe he would
even<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> hero<00:01:45.509> call<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.079> searching<00:01:46.710> high

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
even make a hero call a searching high

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
even make a hero call a searching high
and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.640> obviously<00:01:47.820> you're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> call

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and then obviously you're going to call

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.319 
and then obviously you're going to call
it<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> ice<00:01:48.869> queen<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.409> Queens<00:01:49.920> fall<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it the ice queen for Queens fall and I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.569 
it the ice queen for Queens fall and I
