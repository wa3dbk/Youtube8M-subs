00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.480
 see a recipe that I 'm sure of me 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.540
 really will like it a lot 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 some meatballs made with tofu is 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 since you're always asking us 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.420
 more often than receptive with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.609
 the tofu we thought of doing in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 these meatballs that are delicious 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.960
 also beautiful to see in my opinion is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 very very easy indeed I do 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 immediately see how it is formed first 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 what are we going to add our 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 game and the courgettes as you see us 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.380
 we have first minced or children if you use 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.239
 a fairly compact tofu 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
 maybe you can break it first or 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 blend if instead you use a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 quite as soft as that all 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 we use you can simply 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 then put it in with your hands and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750
 we will mix all the chief who 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.390
 we use in this case is that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.239
 extra movies we took from asia 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 market even if there is written extra film is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.890
 quite soft as you have seen 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.629
 we also put four blades of grass 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 chive that with said kim and makes us 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.670
 really great 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.610
 let's add radio 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.950
 a bit of turmeric also in this case 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 you can then put the herbs that spice 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.320
 prefer and we obviously put the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 salt we mix all the ingredients 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 add the breadcrumbs 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.299
 let's start forming our meatballs 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.930
 we make corrections enough 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.090
 small and then come back to the selini 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.270
 let's give them the most sesame ones 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.420
 normal as these are those of sesame 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.420
 liri 0 and those of poppy 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.670
 look at all these beautiful colored ones 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.410
 we immediately inform you at 180 degrees Mendes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 ventilated our tofu balls 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.330
 are ready in the oven have done 40 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.110
 minutes or so and not delicious perfume 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.420
 federica but we tasted it too 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 some and they are really very good 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.410
 plague for seconds if you have to do 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.210
 some aperitifs or worse appetizers 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 enter but you will surely look great 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.950
 and I 'm sure no one will ever say that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.600
 they are made with mice which is usually a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 ingredient that passes a little bit in second 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.210
 plan 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 in itself it is not that I have a great deal 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.280
 taste, however, if it is mixed 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.670
 right ingredients cooked in the right 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 way 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 it really becomes a very ingredient 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.650
 very nice 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.540
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:49.600
