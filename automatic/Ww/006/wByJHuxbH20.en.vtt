so<00:00:23.540> I<00:00:23.570> get<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> lot<00:00:24.380> of<00:00:24.410> questions<00:00:25.100> about<00:00:25.430> how<00:00:25.880> we

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
so I get a lot of questions about how we

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.080 
so I get a lot of questions about how we
hang<00:00:26.330> our<00:00:26.510> towers<00:00:27.190> it<00:00:28.190> seems<00:00:28.490> that<00:00:28.670> people<00:00:28.820> are

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
hang our towers it seems that people are

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.510 
hang our towers it seems that people are
a<00:00:29.150> little<00:00:29.300> unclear<00:00:29.720> on<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:30.619> know<00:00:30.770> how<00:00:31.279> they're

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
a little unclear on you know how they're

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.370 
a little unclear on you know how they're
supposed<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.910> do<00:00:32.060> it<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.330> exact<00:00:32.660> way<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.930> do<00:00:33.200> it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
supposed to do it the exact way to do it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.680 
supposed to do it the exact way to do it
they<00:00:34.040> want<00:00:34.310> to<00:00:34.460> know<00:00:34.580> what<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.970> easiest<00:00:35.510> way

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
they want to know what the easiest way

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.840 
they want to know what the easiest way
is<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:38.239> I'll<00:00:38.390> tell<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.750> we<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:40.190> use<00:00:40.340> zipgrow

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
is so I'll tell you we we use zipgrow

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.360 
is so I'll tell you we we use zipgrow
towers<00:00:40.940> into<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.690> towers<00:00:42.020> that<00:00:42.140> we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
towers into the towers that we

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.860 
towers into the towers that we
manufacture

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.810 

and<00:00:47.320> we're<00:00:47.560> kind<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.860> toning<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.340> down<00:00:48.370> right

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
and we're kind of toning it down right

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.130 
and we're kind of toning it down right
now<00:00:49.000> we're<00:00:49.210> getting<00:00:49.420> ready<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.660> move<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.080> new

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
now we're getting ready to move to a new

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.930 
now we're getting ready to move to a new
greenhouse<00:00:50.590> so<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.070> greenhouse<00:00:51.430> isn't<00:00:51.760> quite

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
greenhouse so the greenhouse isn't quite

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.420 
greenhouse so the greenhouse isn't quite
full<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:53.650> can<00:00:53.830> kind<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.070> get<00:00:54.220> an<00:00:54.340> idea

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
full but you can kind of get an idea

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.549 
full but you can kind of get an idea
here<00:00:54.850> we<00:00:55.030> basically<00:00:55.720> use<00:00:56.400> salvage<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.640> cheapo

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
here we basically use salvage and cheapo

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.770 
here we basically use salvage and cheapo
tubing<00:00:59.559> steel<00:01:00.370> tubing<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:00.970> pipes<00:01:01.239> whatever

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
tubing steel tubing and pipes whatever

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.430 
tubing steel tubing and pipes whatever
we<00:01:01.900> can<00:01:02.050> find

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
we can find

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.910 
we can find
you<00:01:02.890> see<00:01:03.100> we've<00:01:03.190> got<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:04.350> galvanized<00:01:05.350> happen

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
you see we've got the galvanized happen

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.310 
you see we've got the galvanized happen
steel<00:01:06.220> pipe<00:01:06.490> back<00:01:06.850> there<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.450> have<00:01:07.990> probably

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
steel pipe back there that have probably

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.460 
steel pipe back there that have probably
pulled<00:01:08.560> out<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.920> dumpster<00:01:09.130> somewhere<00:01:09.610> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
pulled out of a dumpster somewhere and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.990 
pulled out of a dumpster somewhere and
we've<00:01:11.470> got<00:01:11.619> electrical<00:01:12.070> conduit<00:01:12.520> here<00:01:12.820> and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
we've got electrical conduit here and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.750 
we've got electrical conduit here and
this<00:01:13.119> looks<00:01:13.540> like<00:01:13.830> either<00:01:14.830> heavy<00:01:15.160> electrical

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
this looks like either heavy electrical

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.930 
this looks like either heavy electrical
conduit<00:01:16.150> or<00:01:16.420> actually<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.229> fence<00:01:17.470> post<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.910> you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
conduit or actually a fence post so you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.700 
conduit or actually a fence post so you
can<00:01:19.180> see<00:01:19.330> we<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.660> kind<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.930> grabbed<00:01:20.470> this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
can see we just kind of grabbed this

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.749 
can see we just kind of grabbed this
stuff<00:01:21.660> this<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:22.720> our<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:24.220> play<00:01:24.460> around

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
stuff this is our little play around

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
stuff this is our little play around
system<00:01:25.270> over<00:01:25.509> here<00:01:25.540> but<00:01:26.500> it's<00:01:26.649> basically

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
system over here but it's basically

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.920 
system over here but it's basically
rigged<00:01:27.430> up<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.759> same<00:01:27.940> way<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.360> almost

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
rigged up the same way that almost

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.719 
rigged up the same way that almost
everything<00:01:29.410> else<00:01:29.500> in<00:01:29.770> here<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.009> it's<00:01:30.399> just<00:01:30.490> a

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
everything else in here is it's just a

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.820 
everything else in here is it's just a
little<00:01:30.759> bit<00:01:31.030> more<00:01:31.180> messy<00:01:31.420> but<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> thought<00:01:32.649> you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
little bit more messy but I thought you

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.469 
little bit more messy but I thought you
know<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.430> would<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.790> would<00:01:33.880> basically

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
know it would it would basically

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.139 
know it would it would basically
illustrate<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.740> best<00:01:36.040> way<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.399> kind<00:01:36.910> of<00:01:37.000> hang

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
illustrate the best way to kind of hang

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.300 
illustrate the best way to kind of hang
these<00:01:37.330> things<00:01:37.600> up<00:01:37.810> where<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.619> person<00:01:39.009> at<00:01:39.130> home

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
these things up where the person at home

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.219 
these things up where the person at home
was<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.940> wanting<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.570> hang<00:01:40.810> some<00:01:41.020> bunt

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
was just wanting to hang some bunt

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.910 
was just wanting to hang some bunt
towers<00:01:41.740> up<00:01:41.890> for<00:01:42.039> fun<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.550> do<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.509> on<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.690> cheap

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
towers up for fun and do it on the cheap

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.650 
towers up for fun and do it on the cheap
so<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.520> way<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.880> we<00:01:45.970> do<00:01:46.119> this<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:46.509> we

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
so the way that we do this is we

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.010 
so the way that we do this is we
basically<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:47.350> set<00:01:48.190> this<00:01:48.450> whole<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.869> can

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
basically just set this whole up you can

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.710 
basically just set this whole up you can
put<00:01:50.200> them<00:01:50.289> on<00:01:50.380> post<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.759> put<00:01:52.149> them<00:01:52.240> on<00:01:52.390> you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
put them on post you can put them on you

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.660 
put them on post you can put them on you
know<00:01:52.810> put<00:01:53.050> two<00:01:53.200> vertical<00:01:53.619> poles<00:01:53.860> or<00:01:54.220> posts<00:01:54.550> on

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
know put two vertical poles or posts on

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.240 
know put two vertical poles or posts on
either<00:01:54.819> in<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.330> just<00:01:55.420> put<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.920> pole

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
either in and just put the your pole

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.540 
either in and just put the your pole
spanning<00:01:57.819> it<00:01:57.880> your<00:01:58.330> games<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:59.050> bar<00:01:59.550> whatever

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
spanning it your games your bar whatever

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.180 
spanning it your games your bar whatever
you're<00:02:00.910> using

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
you're using

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.980 
you're using
and<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.760> us<00:02:02.880> we've<00:02:03.120> just<00:02:03.300> got<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> hooked<00:02:03.750> on

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and for us we've just got it hooked on

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
and for us we've just got it hooked on
to<00:02:04.230> our<00:02:04.520> greenhouse<00:02:05.520> superstructure<00:02:06.240> here

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to our greenhouse superstructure here

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.510 
to our greenhouse superstructure here
and<00:02:06.540> zip<00:02:06.720> tied<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.140> place<00:02:07.380> zip<00:02:08.040> ties<00:02:08.280> are

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and zip tied in place zip ties are

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
and zip tied in place zip ties are
wonderful<00:02:09.300> zip<00:02:09.840> ties<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.260> duct<00:02:10.410> tape<00:02:10.440> right

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
wonderful zip ties in duct tape right

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.300 
wonderful zip ties in duct tape right
and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:11.910> basically<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:12.840> run<00:02:13.200> our<00:02:13.560> irrigation

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and then basically we run our irrigation

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.560 
and then basically we run our irrigation

and<00:02:19.350> we<00:02:19.470> run<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:20.210> under<00:02:21.210> me<00:02:21.660> our<00:02:22.170> whole<00:02:23.300> we

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and we run that under me our whole we

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.510 
and we run that under me our whole we
use<00:02:24.480> zip<00:02:24.690> ties<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.230> kind<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.800> like

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
use zip ties you can kind of see like

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
use zip ties you can kind of see like
right<00:02:26.700> there<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> zip<00:02:27.570> tie<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.620> hold

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
right there we use a zip tie to to hold

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.010 
right there we use a zip tie to to hold
it<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.160> place<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.390> keep<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:30.870> moving

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
it in place and to keep it from moving

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.810 
it in place and to keep it from moving
around

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
around

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.120 
around
we<00:02:32.820> use<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.570> your<00:02:33.840> basic<00:02:34.050> rain<00:02:34.530> bird<00:02:34.830> or

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
we use just your basic rain bird or

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.820 
we use just your basic rain bird or
cheapo<00:02:35.790> kind<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.420> drip<00:02:36.600> emitters

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.150 

but<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.360> know<00:02:42.630> they're<00:02:42.810> just

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
but you can see you know they're just

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.650 
but you can see you know they're just
basically<00:02:44.160> flow<00:02:44.520> through<00:02:44.940> there's<00:02:45.480> no

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
basically flow through there's no

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.060 
basically flow through there's no
membrane<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.320> there<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.800> want<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
membrane in there you don't want a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.600 
membrane in there you don't want a
membrane<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.540> these<00:02:49.350> work<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.860> systems<00:02:50.100> where

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
membrane and these work in systems where

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.000 
membrane and these work in systems where
there's<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:51.090> low<00:02:51.420> system<00:02:51.720> solids<00:02:52.680> okay<00:02:52.950> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
there's really low system solids okay so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.250 
there's really low system solids okay so
if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> whole<00:02:54.570> lot<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> solid

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
if you don't have a whole lot of solid

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.930 
if you don't have a whole lot of solid
circulating<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.160> system<00:02:56.520> these<00:02:56.700> things

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
circulating in your system these things

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.280 
circulating in your system these things
work<00:02:57.120> great<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.380> do<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.740> lots<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.160> solids

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
work great if you do have lots of solids

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.710 
work great if you do have lots of solids
we<00:03:01.290> use<00:03:01.500> half-inch<00:03:02.040> pbc<00:03:02.730> with<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.510> holes

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
we use half-inch pbc with just holes

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
we use half-inch pbc with just holes
drilled<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:05.010> irrigate<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> tops<00:03:06.360> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
drilled in it to irrigate the tops of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.600 
drilled in it to irrigate the tops of
the<00:03:06.630> towers<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.230> would<00:03:08.040> recommend<00:03:08.490> for

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the towers I would recommend for

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.760 
the towers I would recommend for
everyone<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.660> side<00:03:09.900> wall<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
everyone this is a side wall that you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.860 
everyone this is a side wall that you
oversize<00:03:11.340> your<00:03:11.580> pump<00:03:11.820> or<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.060> install<00:03:12.480> valves

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
oversize your pump or you install valves

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.020 
oversize your pump or you install valves
on<00:03:13.020> your<00:03:13.170> lines<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.310> can<00:03:14.520> open<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.880> valve

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
on your lines so you can open a valve

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.210 
on your lines so you can open a valve
and<00:03:15.300> blow<00:03:15.540> your<00:03:15.690> line<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.800> saves<00:03:17.040> you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and blow your line out and it saves you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
and blow your line out and it saves you
the<00:03:17.280> trouble<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.790> Matt<00:03:18.030> only<00:03:18.300> going<00:03:18.660> through

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the trouble of Matt only going through

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.260 
the trouble of Matt only going through
pulling<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.490> know<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.850> little<00:03:21.000> thing

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
pulling the you know your little thing

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.600 
pulling the you know your little thing
and<00:03:21.480> blowing<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> out<00:03:22.709> or<00:03:22.920> doing<00:03:23.130> whatever<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
and blowing it out or doing whatever it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.240 
and blowing it out or doing whatever it
takes<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.630> clean<00:03:24.870> these<00:03:25.050> things<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.430 

that's<00:03:29.820> basically<00:03:30.330> how<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> irrigation

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
that's basically how the irrigation

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.140 
that's basically how the irrigation
tubing<00:03:31.950> works<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.460> we<00:03:32.550> just<00:03:32.730> run<00:03:32.970> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
tubing works and we just run that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.250 
tubing works and we just run that
constantly<00:03:34.850> you'll<00:03:35.850> find<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.360> if<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.050> run

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
constantly you'll find it if you run

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260 
constantly you'll find it if you run
your<00:03:37.380> pumps<00:03:37.860> constantly<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:38.580> save<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> lot<00:03:39.240> of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
your pumps constantly you save a lot of

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.960 
your pumps constantly you save a lot of
money<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.870> burned-out<00:03:40.440> pumps<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.580> long

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
money on burned-out pumps in the long

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.720 
money on burned-out pumps in the long
run<00:03:42.210> so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
run so

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.580 
run so
burned<00:03:44.330> out<00:03:44.420> moms<00:03:44.690> cost<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.170> lot<00:03:45.319> more<00:03:45.380> than

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
burned out moms cost a lot more than

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.220 
burned out moms cost a lot more than
electricity<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.370> my<00:03:46.400> experience<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.050> the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
electricity in my experience so the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.890 
electricity in my experience so the
towers<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.940> basically<00:03:50.330> just<00:03:50.420> take<00:03:50.630> our

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
towers you basically just take our

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.140 
towers you basically just take our
hanger<00:03:51.200> okay<00:03:51.560> these<00:03:52.250> are<00:03:52.400> some<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.730> our<00:03:52.819> crappy

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
hanger okay these are some of our crappy

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.750 
hanger okay these are some of our crappy
old<00:03:53.739> prototype<00:03:54.739> mangers<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.370> don't<00:03:55.580> work

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
old prototype mangers that don't work

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.780 
old prototype mangers that don't work
great<00:03:56.090> but<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.830> can<00:03:57.980> see<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:58.459> hang<00:03:58.640> our

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
great but you can see we just hang our

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.120 
great but you can see we just hang our
towers<00:03:59.120> up

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
towers up

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.780 
towers up
over<00:04:01.850> our<00:04:02.480> irrigation<00:04:03.230> tubing<00:04:03.530> we<00:04:04.400> can<00:04:04.580> kind

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
over our irrigation tubing we can kind

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.000 
over our irrigation tubing we can kind
of<00:04:04.880> move<00:04:05.000> those<00:04:05.270> around<00:04:05.570> however<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:06.620> need<00:04:06.770> to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
of move those around however we need to

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.380 
of move those around however we need to
to<00:04:07.820> get<00:04:08.000> our<00:04:08.770> irrigation<00:04:09.770> tubing<00:04:10.310> where<00:04:11.270> we

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
to get our irrigation tubing where we

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.540 
to get our irrigation tubing where we
want<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:11.930> drain<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.040> top<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.490> the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
want it and drain to the top of the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.420 
want it and drain to the top of the
tower<00:04:14.530> sometimes<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.740> helps<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.190> you've<00:04:16.280> got

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
tower sometimes it helps and you've got

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.040 
tower sometimes it helps and you've got
new<00:04:16.610> seedlings<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.239> kind<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.540> direct<00:04:17.870> that

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
new seedlings to kind of direct that

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.960 
new seedlings to kind of direct that
irrigation<00:04:18.530> forward<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.310> little<00:04:19.459> bit<00:04:19.580> so<00:04:19.730> you

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
irrigation forward a little bit so you

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.270 
irrigation forward a little bit so you
get<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.330> around<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.780> really<00:04:21.650> young<00:04:21.860> really

it's just kind of common sense using

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
Tower hanging goes it's just really

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.240 
Tower hanging goes it's just really
simple<00:04:45.910> really<00:04:46.570> not<00:04:46.810> complicated<00:04:47.160> if<00:04:48.160> you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
simple really not complicated if you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.810 
simple really not complicated if you
look<00:04:48.490> up<00:04:48.670> here<00:04:48.700> on<00:04:49.330> on<00:04:49.990> these<00:04:50.290> powers<00:04:50.820> you'll

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
look up here on on these powers you'll

look up here on on these powers you'll
see<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.270> we're<00:04:52.720> using<00:04:53.280> Yoona<00:04:54.280> strut<00:04:54.580> okay<00:04:55.230> so

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
see that we're using Yoona strut okay so

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.930 
see that we're using Yoona strut okay so
this<00:04:56.380> is<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> really<00:04:58.800> cheap<00:04:59.800> kind<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.490> metal

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this is a really cheap kind of metal

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.280 
this is a really cheap kind of metal
strut<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:03.190> use<00:05:03.340> conduit<00:05:03.910> clamps<00:05:04.480> to

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
strut and we use conduit clamps to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.520 
strut and we use conduit clamps to
basically<00:05:05.680> hold<00:05:05.980> down<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:07.570> hold<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.080> fixed

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
basically hold down to hold the fixed

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
fixed to that unit strut we just hang

fixed to that unit strut we just hang
the<00:05:17.169> towers<00:05:17.560> just<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:18.070> we<00:05:18.220> go<00:05:18.370> over<00:05:18.580> here<00:05:18.610> it

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
the towers just like we go over here it

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.640 
the towers just like we go over here it
just<00:05:18.970> looks<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.300> little<00:05:19.390> cleaner<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:20.080> prettier

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
just looks a little cleaner and prettier

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.130 
just looks a little cleaner and prettier
and<00:05:21.040> nicer
