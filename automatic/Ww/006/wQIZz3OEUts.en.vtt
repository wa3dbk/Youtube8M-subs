with<00:00:14.400> Wi-Fi<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.480> kind<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> complicated

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
with Wi-Fi but it's kind of complicated

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.890 
with Wi-Fi but it's kind of complicated
I<00:00:16.680> don't<00:00:17.400> even<00:00:17.490> know<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.660> let's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I don't even know how to do it so let's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.460 
I don't even know how to do it so let's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
do it the easy way and like I said this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
do it the easy way and like I said this
is<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.680> older<00:00:22.949> version<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.279> destiny<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> said<00:00:24.060> in

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
is an older version of destiny I said in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.050 
is an older version of destiny I said in
the<00:00:24.240> old<00:00:24.390> video<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> let's<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.670> started<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the old video so let's get started so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
the old video so let's get started so
first<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.420> extract<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.279> you'd<00:00:29.279> want<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
first we extract it you'd want to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
first we extract it you'd want to
actually<00:00:29.849> install<00:00:30.000> wind<00:00:30.449> cap<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.740> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
actually install wind cap which we just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.410 
actually install wind cap which we just
saw<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> folder<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> already<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
saw in the folder I already have it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.170 
saw in the folder I already have it
installed<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.610> these<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.880> files

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
installed so we're not these two files

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
installed so we're not these two files
here<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.350> drag<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.770> into<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here you want to just drag them into the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.260 
here you want to just drag them into the
decimate<00:00:39.809> folder<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:41.160> trust<00:00:42.030> me<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
decimate folder and then trust me is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.490 
decimate folder and then trust me is
going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> much<00:00:42.750> easier<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
going to make it much easier for the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.279 
going to make it much easier for the
step<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.539> okay<00:00:45.539> so

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
once you open it I have 64-bit so I'm

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.630 
once you open it I have 64-bit so I'm
going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> open<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:49.140> XT<00:00:50.010> 4<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.579> to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
this anyways in the next step we're not

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410 
this anyways in the next step we're not
going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.040> restart<00:01:47.370> it<00:01:47.460> yet<00:01:47.610> okay

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
going to restart it yet okay

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to restart it yet okay
so<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:48.870> to<00:01:48.930> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.320> settings

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so we're going to go to Wi-Fi settings

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
so we're going to go to Wi-Fi settings
and<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.660> actually<00:01:52.050> test<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and we want to actually test the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
and we want to actually test the
connection<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:54.330> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.510> go<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
connection so you're going to go to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.570 
connection so you're going to go to
Wi-Fi<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.380> tend<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> Wi-Fi<00:01:56.130> connection<00:01:56.190> you

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
Wi-Fi and tend the Wi-Fi connection you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.820 
Wi-Fi and tend the Wi-Fi connection you
see<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.760> connections<00:01:57.180> already<00:01:57.510> there<00:01:57.770> okay<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
see a connections already there okay so

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.969 
see a connections already there okay so
you're<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.220> test<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.580> connection<00:02:00.979> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you're going to test the connection this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.650 
you're going to test the connection this
might<00:02:02.220> take<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> while<00:02:02.610> you're<00:02:03.240> actually<00:02:03.570> going

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
might take a while you're actually going

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.420 
might take a while you're actually going
to<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.050> gonna<00:02:04.170> hit<00:02:04.350> green<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> second

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to see it's gonna hit green for a second

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
to see it's gonna hit green for a second
oh<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.640> god<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> connected<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.930> did<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> no

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
oh my god it's connected we did it no

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.730 
oh my god it's connected we did it no
you<00:02:08.490> didn't<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.179> actually<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> glitch<00:02:10.110> it's

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
you didn't it's actually a glitch it's

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.830 
you didn't it's actually a glitch it's
gonna<00:02:10.890> start<00:02:11.160> connecting<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> might<00:02:12.810> even

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
gonna start connecting and it might even

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840 
gonna start connecting and it might even
take<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.320> minute<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.920> connect<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:14.670> keep

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
take a minute to connect and just keep

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.010 
take a minute to connect and just keep
loading<00:02:15.170> but<00:02:16.170> you'll<00:02:16.410> never<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.739> connected

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
loading but you'll never be connected

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
loading but you'll never be connected
this<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.170> actually<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> step<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.100> always

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
this is actually the step that always

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
this is actually the step that always
stumps<00:02:21.090> me<00:02:21.150> because<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:21.989> stopped<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.650> this

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
stumps me because I just stopped at this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
stumps me because I just stopped at this
point<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.910> working<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> just

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
point I think it's working but I just

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.270 
point I think it's working but I just
think<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.870> glitch<00:02:24.959> you're<00:02:25.560> always<00:02:25.950> gonna

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
think it's a glitch you're always gonna

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.770 
think it's a glitch you're always gonna
get<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> error<00:02:26.670> code<00:02:26.910> 5200<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:29.010> know

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
get the error code 5200 because you know

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.570 
get the error code 5200 because you know
there's<00:02:30.780> nothing<00:02:30.959> else<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.410> could<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.770> so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
there's nothing else you could do so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.210 
there's nothing else you could do so
we're<00:02:32.820> just<00:02:32.850> gonna<00:02:33.060> go<00:02:33.300> back<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.709> guess

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
we're just gonna go back and I guess

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.240 
we're just gonna go back and I guess
just<00:02:35.489> close<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.739> okay<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> next

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
just close this out okay so the next

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.920 
just close this out okay so the next
step<00:02:38.489> now<00:02:38.520> we're<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.600> use<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> other

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
step now we're going to use the other

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.280 
step now we're going to use the other
zipped<00:02:40.290> file<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.870> firmware

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
zipped file we got here the firmware

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.610 
zipped file we got here the firmware
file<00:02:44.040> um<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.080> want<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.440> open

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
file um so what you want to do is open

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.699 
file um so what you want to do is open
the<00:02:46.830> décima<00:02:47.370> folder<00:02:47.670> back<00:02:47.820> up<00:02:48.200> make<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.230> like

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the décima folder back up make it like

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.610 
the décima folder back up make it like
this<00:02:49.950> windowed<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.269> now<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.420> grabbed<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.230> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
this windowed so now I grabbed it and I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.680 
this windowed so now I grabbed it and I
just<00:02:52.860> dragged<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.489> there<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:53.940> move

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
just dragged it in there and just move

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.830 
just dragged it in there and just move
and<00:02:54.810> replace<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.220> make<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.660> was

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and replace so you make sure that it was

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800 
and replace so you make sure that it was
replaced<00:02:58.260> open<00:02:59.250> up<00:02:59.370> destiny<00:02:59.790> again<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.239> we're

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
replaced open up destiny again and we're

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.500 
replaced open up destiny again and we're
gonna<00:03:00.900> open<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.440> wrong<00:03:01.730> Pokemon<00:03:02.730> white<00:03:03.239> -

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
gonna open up the wrong Pokemon white -

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.030 
gonna open up the wrong Pokemon white -
I<00:03:04.880> was<00:03:05.880> gonna<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.180> black<00:03:06.390> -<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> did<00:03:07.470> black<00:03:07.709> -

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
I was gonna do black - but I did black -

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.300 
I was gonna do black - but I did black -
last<00:03:08.340> time<00:03:09.080> luckily<00:03:10.080> both<00:03:10.410> save<00:03:10.680> files<00:03:10.980> work

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
last time luckily both save files work

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
last time luckily both save files work
like<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.760> use<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> white<00:03:12.150> file<00:03:12.510> Wow<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.709> long

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
like if I use a white file Wow as long

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.580 
like if I use a white file Wow as long
as<00:03:13.980> I'm<00:03:14.190> not<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.549> spa<00:03:14.880> that's<00:03:15.630> exclusive<00:03:16.380> -

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
as I'm not in a spa that's exclusive -

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
as I'm not in a spa that's exclusive -
white<00:03:16.769> or<00:03:17.040> black<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.700> would<00:03:17.820> look<00:03:18.060> perfectly

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
white or black it would look perfectly

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390 
white or black it would look perfectly
fine<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.350> save<00:03:19.500> file<00:03:19.709> works<00:03:19.950> since<00:03:20.250> we

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
fine so the save file works since we

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.740 
fine so the save file works since we
actually<00:03:20.700> did<00:03:20.850> restart<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.510> me<00:03:21.630> this

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
actually did restart this to me this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
actually did restart this to me this
time<00:03:21.959> now<00:03:22.470> we're<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.739> go<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.130> 10<00:03:23.280> to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
time now we're going to go to them 10 to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.920 
time now we're going to go to them 10 to
Wi-Fi<00:03:23.640> as<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.030> see<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.360> three<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.750> them

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
Wi-Fi as you can see all three of them

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.199 
Wi-Fi as you can see all three of them
are<00:03:25.140> actually<00:03:25.739> there<00:03:26.220> we're<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:26.790> gonna<00:03:26.880> test

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
are actually there we're just gonna test

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.940 
are actually there we're just gonna test
the<00:03:27.450> first<00:03:27.600> one<00:03:27.900> since<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.530> only<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.860> to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
the first one since it's only going to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.520 
the first one since it's only going to
be<00:03:29.010> using<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> first<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:31.200> should<00:03:31.230> do

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
be using the first one and it should do

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.020 
be using the first one and it should do
it<00:03:31.620> much<00:03:31.829> faster<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.790> time<00:03:32.910> it's

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it much faster this and this time it's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.350 
it much faster this and this time it's
actually<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.390> connect<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.410> tell<00:03:35.040> you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
actually gonna connect and tell you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.900 
actually gonna connect and tell you
succeeded<00:03:36.360> as<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:36.959> even<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> back<00:03:37.910> it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
succeeded as you can even in the back it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.030 
succeeded as you can even in the back it
says<00:03:39.150> Wi-Fi<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.750> connected<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
says Wi-Fi is connected so the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.710 
says Wi-Fi is connected so the
connection<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.519> successful<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.209> time<00:03:42.269> so

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
connection is successful this time so

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
connection is successful this time so
now<00:03:42.810> we're<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.110> go<00:03:43.200> back<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.769> we're

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
now we're going to go back and we're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.520 
now we're going to go back and we're
actually<00:03:44.489> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.880> test<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:46.079> Keldeo

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
actually going to test it on the Keldeo

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.380 
actually going to test it on the Keldeo
event<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.130> we're<00:03:47.579> going<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.760> see<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.269> is

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
event and we're going to see so this is

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.589 
event and we're going to see so this is
like<00:03:48.570> I'm<00:03:48.750> doing<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.110> Kelly<00:03:49.320> over<00:03:49.560> again

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
like I'm doing the Kelly over again

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.119 
like I'm doing the Kelly over again
you<00:03:50.840> know<00:03:51.129> so<00:03:52.129> let's<00:03:52.459> do<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.760> again<00:03:54.129> anyways

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
you know so let's do it again anyways

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.059 
you know so let's do it again anyways
like<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.790> said<00:03:55.969> this<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.829> destiny<00:03:57.829> so<00:03:57.920> it's

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
like I said this is destiny so it's

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.190 
like I said this is destiny so it's
going<00:03:58.159> to<00:03:58.219> run<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.549> little<00:03:58.879> sluggish<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.659> know

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
going to run a little sluggish you know

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.809 
going to run a little sluggish you know
despite<00:04:00.409> how<00:04:00.709> powerful<00:04:01.189> your<00:04:01.340> computer<00:04:01.700> is

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
despite how powerful your computer is

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.809 
despite how powerful your computer is
I'm<00:04:01.969> going<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.150> have<00:04:02.329> like<00:04:02.569> freaking<00:04:03.519> 3.1<00:04:04.519> quad

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
I'm going to have like freaking 3.1 quad

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.699 
I'm going to have like freaking 3.1 quad
core<00:04:05.209> with<00:04:05.450> hyper-threading<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.409> it's<00:04:06.590> like

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
core with hyper-threading so it's like

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.369 
core with hyper-threading so it's like
eight<00:04:06.920> cores<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.700> this<00:04:08.450> thing<00:04:08.780> runs<00:04:09.049> really

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
eight cores in this thing runs really

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.470 
eight cores in this thing runs really
slow<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:10.430> know<00:04:10.459> don't<00:04:10.790> blame<00:04:10.939> your<00:04:11.120> computer

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
it's the problem with team they're kind

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.779 
it's the problem with team they're kind
of<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.030> older<00:04:14.329> versions<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.900> golfin<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.620> know

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
of the older versions of golfin you know

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.249 
of the older versions of golfin you know
no<00:04:16.789> matter<00:04:16.970> how<00:04:17.090> powerful<00:04:17.479> your<00:04:17.720> computer<00:04:18.109> was

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
no matter how powerful your computer was

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.129 
no matter how powerful your computer was
they<00:04:18.560> still<00:04:19.070> ran<00:04:19.430> slow<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.389> before<00:04:20.750> dolphin

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
they still ran slow and before dolphin

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.290 
they still ran slow and before dolphin
couldn't<00:04:21.440> even<00:04:21.620> read<00:04:21.859> quad-core<00:04:22.550> processors

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
couldn't even read quad-core processors

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.680 
couldn't even read quad-core processors
so<00:04:23.720> even<00:04:24.470> if<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.620> had<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.130> good<00:04:25.580> eye<00:04:25.789> seven

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
so even if you had like a good eye seven

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.560 
so even if you had like a good eye seven
or<00:04:26.810> something<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.349> wasn't<00:04:27.650> gonna<00:04:27.770> work

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
or something it wasn't gonna work

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.529 
or something it wasn't gonna work
anyways<00:04:30.099> we<00:04:31.099> just<00:04:31.310> made<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> new<00:04:31.699> Wi-Fi<00:04:32.180> count

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
anyways we just made a new Wi-Fi count

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.960 
anyways we just made a new Wi-Fi count
on<00:04:32.780> intend<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.500> Wi-Fi<00:04:33.889> an<00:04:34.310> account<00:04:34.759> that<00:04:34.880> would

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
on intend to Wi-Fi an account that would

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.060 
on intend to Wi-Fi an account that would
probably<00:04:35.120> never<00:04:35.330> gonna<00:04:35.449> use<00:04:35.570> again<00:04:35.840> but<00:04:36.229> now

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
probably never gonna use again but now

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.110 
probably never gonna use again but now
it's<00:04:37.220> going<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.430> start<00:04:37.550> searching<00:04:37.910> for<00:04:38.060> the
