00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.630
 what time is it 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.830
 it's 11 and 45 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.970
 good if you want to know how to have city 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.860
 in spanish on a iphone 4g from factory no 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.099
 you can have it good keep seeing this 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.099
 video 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.170
 Hi, how about I'm good techno jota 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.900
 today we are going to see how to install siri in 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.300
 Spanish at last on an iphone 4 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.210
 this is also compatible for a 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.530
 iphone 4g and an an iphone 3gs and an ipad2 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.090
 this method is exactly the same in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.489
 any of those devices and good 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.550
 we will be able to have yes and now in 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.019
 Spanish how can they see and hear what 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.000
 what you have to do is really very, very 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.460
 simple obviously I have to have 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.399
 done jailbreak and I have to have cydia 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.969
 because you have to install some things in 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.610
 Syria what they have to do is add 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.509
 a repo so they go to sources edit 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.310
 add and clarified that they are going to type is a 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.680
 address that he left in the description of 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.440
 video would become of this repo 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.369
 Llama and Hack Store Puntocom Bar Repo 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.300
 that they have to add is the repository 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.039
 but good the description is 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.200
 exactly the address that 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.270
 you have to put and inside 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 this repository what they have to do 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.420
 is to install 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 effectively cities for DC and here has 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 careful because installing depends on the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.039
 device that we have is depends on the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 ie I do not have no I am now in a 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.070
 iphone 4 with io sc point 1.2 so 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.250
 obviously that is the one that I have installed 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 if I have the 1 the 61 here is if I have 60 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 here they are for all the children 16 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.409
 basically they are for everyone including 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.490
 also for the ios5 there I have for the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.470
 ipad is for the ipad 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 but good you have to be very careful 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.670
 to install exactly this city 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.940
 it depends on the device and the mess that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.590
 one have so be very careful with that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 then we install it obviously 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.280
 We find seems to modify because 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.739
 I have installed this will take a good 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.720
 depends on the condition you have in 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.569
 internet because they calculate that they are more or 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.260
 minus 100 megabytes what will go down like this 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.480
 that is going to be here for a while would be 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.280
 downloading once you finish 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.620
 install will ask to make a redoubt of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.750
 peace in that network obviously and they are going to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.630
 find that in your penguins are going to have 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.990
 this application is called city the air 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.050
 and they execute it and here they go to the second 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.440
 option that is used as a reserve 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.320
 and here they are going to put this option that is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.940
 say read in Spanish can you test if 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.340
 they want it in English is the top of 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
 all 15 server but obviously I would 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.960
 I want in Spanish so tighten is 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.880
 to say of er in Spanish they touch that not 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.310
 everything can be installed 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.740
 they are going to look like a poster that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 is going to ask to do another network sprint what 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.640
 touch that button is the one that is here to the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.010
 left that appears on the left what 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.680
 touch the device makes a break 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.690
 then when it is restarted again 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.570
 device they get back into this 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.940
 application to the same application and now 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.310
 they touch down everything where it says download 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.310
 to certify they play there 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.230
 we're going to swim safari and they're going to 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.850
 look like a screen similar to this one in 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.340
 my case I already have it installed because 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.170
 I appear reliable and eliminate you 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.310
 by air appear some red as not 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.440
 it is recommended or it is not reliable, it is not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.440
 worry do not be scared you put 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.900
 install interests me because without this no 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.000
 it's going to work continue so they install 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.230
 this profile install it if it is 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.600
 there is automatically no need to do 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.550
 absolutely nothing once you have it 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.440
 installed what they are going to do is they are going to 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.810
 make a new break and turn it to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.330
 turn on and adjustments will still be made 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.720
 We will not use if they are going to come here 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.350
 below and they will find that says if de r 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.090
 settings get there and activate as 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.630
 I have its activated all this obviously 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.030
 enable dictation and you have to activate this 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.490
 option that is below the last one of 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.190
 all be here they have to activate 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.560
 that option if it is not already activated 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.390
 if it's already activated obviously not but 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.400
 if it is not active active in this 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.660
 option if not if it will not work in 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.930
 Spanish 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.850
 when they do that they have to again 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.640
 turn off the device and return it to 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.190
 turn on although they can make a break 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.280
 but it is recommended to turn it off completely 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.930
 They turn it off and turn it back to there if 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.930
 they will be able to be using yes 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.080
 who was miguelangel 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.190
 this was what I found in him the angel 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.750
 milk the lodovico hole with rice and 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.009
 simÃ³n and that aprece 6 March of 1100 in the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.199
 answer is to say the nothing really 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.120
 it works pretty well works pretty 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.220
 fast in all though some 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.900
 functions I have seen that they are not 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.009
 they work for example 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.009
 open notes 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.950
 30 and tell me it's coming soon 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.100
 there are things that are really to say and 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.320
 in 16 but obviously not 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.180
 they work because well, this is not there 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.550
 to complain we have to give thanks though 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.680
 be one can install this good in 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.360
 theory in these devices can not be 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.770
 have a civil so good you have to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.889
 thank you even though they work 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.050
 some things so do not expect me to 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.630
 operate 100% as if it were series of 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.270
 truth is series of truth but good not 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.880
 absolutely everything works but so 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.340
 less moves very very well if they want 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.419
 know all the commands come back to 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.040
 activate it 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.640
 and they touch here on the button that 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.640
 information 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:17.179
 and there he explains more or less how 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:19.339
 use it so good try it to see if 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:22.099
 it works for me the first day I do not 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:24.079
 escale did not work for me until the second 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.849
 day of having installed resin and 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:28.189
 it started to work alone so it's 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.689
 question of trying this insist but 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.809
 the steps are that you do not have to do more 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.929
 nothing in fact if you look here in the 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:40.720
 same if leader or in it if here 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:43.220
 above they will see that in general 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.050
 It will seem without 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.520
 it is deactivated and yet 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.440
 it works in fact you have to leave it 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.750
 deactivated this option until the 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.520
 they activate it turns itself off so but 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.520
 just in case you get the deactivated 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.610
 but good I hope that it has served you and 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.169
 you already know how to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.139
 vote the video if they have the networks 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.599
 social and good luck here with siri in 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.129
 those devices obviously if you do not 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.319
 it works or they want to get it good do 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.900
 the same thing in reverse they erase things 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.349
 that installed laziness and ready good 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.349
 see you later
