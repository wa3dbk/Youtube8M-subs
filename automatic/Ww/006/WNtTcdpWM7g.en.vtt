calorie<00:04:49.500> counter<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> can't<00:04:50.669> say<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.360> this

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
calorie counter so I can't say that this

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.810 
calorie counter so I can't say that this
one's<00:04:52.199> better<00:04:52.380> or<00:04:52.650> worse<00:04:52.830> whatever<00:04:53.220> but<00:04:53.520> it

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
one's better or worse whatever but it

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.450 
one's better or worse whatever but it
has<00:04:54.300> been<00:04:54.479> excellent<00:04:54.870> see<00:04:55.650> how<00:04:55.740> easy<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.280> is<00:04:56.400> to

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
has been excellent see how easy it is to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.310 
has been excellent see how easy it is to
just<00:04:56.760> track<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.150> food<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.330> took<00:04:57.659> me<00:04:57.780> about<00:04:57.930> 15

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
just track of food that took me about 15

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.689 
just track of food that took me about 15
seconds<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:58.979> that's<00:04:59.130> what<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.340> do<00:04:59.460> with<00:04:59.580> each

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
seconds and that's what you do with each

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.339 
seconds and that's what you do with each
meal<00:04:59.909> you<00:05:00.150> wait<00:05:00.330> out<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.750> track<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.050> so

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
meal you wait out and you track it so

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.439 
meal you wait out and you track it so
tracking<00:05:02.250> backwards<00:05:02.580> isn't<00:05:02.729> very<00:05:02.849> hard<00:05:03.210> if

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
tracking backwards isn't very hard if

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.760 
tracking backwards isn't very hard if
