00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
okay so as for this boss he's actually

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
okay so as for this boss he's actually
not<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.140> hard<00:02:07.560> what<00:02:08.340> you're<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> want

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
not that hard what you're going to want

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.520 
not that hard what you're going to want
to<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.360> find<00:02:09.780> one<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> smaller

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to do is find one of the smaller

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.140 
to do is find one of the smaller
versions<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.250> them<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.670> suck<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.030> up

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
versions of them and just suck them up

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.010 
versions of them and just suck them up
and<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> previous<00:02:13.770> boss<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.870> has

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and just like the previous boss it has

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
and just like the previous boss it has
to<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.260> something<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.830> balls<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.550> guess<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
to do something with balls I guess the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.970 
to do something with balls I guess the
game<00:02:18.090> boy<00:02:18.300> isn't<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.750> only<00:02:18.870> console<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.830> has

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
game boy isn't the only console that has

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.210 
game boy isn't the only console that has
to<00:02:20.130> do<00:02:20.220> with<00:02:20.370> nothing<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.000> Donuts<00:02:21.450> involves

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
to do with nothing but Donuts involves

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600 
to do with nothing but Donuts involves
further<00:02:23.220> proving<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.790> point<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.330> guess<00:02:24.989> oh<00:02:25.610> wait

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
further proving my point I guess oh wait

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.740 
further proving my point I guess oh wait
now<00:02:26.819> what<00:02:27.000> we're<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.300> want<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
now what we're going to want to do is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.600 
now what we're going to want to do is
just<00:02:27.780> sudden<00:02:28.230> look<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.980> think<00:02:29.519> this

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just sudden look like that I think this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.309 
just sudden look like that I think this
guy<00:02:29.730> counts<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> portrait<00:02:30.959> goes<00:02:31.080> just

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
guy counts as like a portrait goes just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.870 
guy counts as like a portrait goes just
like<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.560> last<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:31.860> did<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.489> he's<00:02:32.760> like

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
like the last one did but he's like

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.309 
like the last one did but he's like
probably<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.480> only<00:02:33.690> one<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.170> isn't

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
probably the only one that isn't

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.350 
probably the only one that isn't
supposed<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.920> human<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.489> if<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.940> remember

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
supposed to be human like if I remember

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.140 
supposed to be human like if I remember
correctly<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:38.280> kind<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.459> weird<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> sort<00:02:39.000> out

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
correctly just kind of weird to sort out

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.570 
correctly just kind of weird to sort out
of<00:02:39.299> place<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.720> sense<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.250> set

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
of place in that sense so now we can set

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.240 
of place in that sense so now we can set
them<00:02:44.730> up<00:02:44.850> again<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.799> may<00:02:46.950> take<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> few

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
them up again this one may take a few

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.230 
them up again this one may take a few
more<00:02:47.519> rounds<00:02:47.760> than

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
more rounds than

00:02:49.240 --> 00:03:00.630 
more rounds than
either<00:02:50.240> way<00:02:50.420> stop<00:02:50.780> really<00:02:50.990> easy

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.580

think<00:04:21.380> what<00:04:21.500> I'll<00:04:21.620> do<00:04:21.739> later<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.400> kind<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
think what I'll do later is just kind of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.159 
think what I'll do later is just kind of
end<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.120> middle<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.510> area<00:04:23.930> and

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
end it in the middle of the area and

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.560 
end it in the middle of the area and
then<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.010> know<00:04:25.130> pick<00:04:25.970> up<00:04:26.120> later<00:04:26.360> on

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
then just you know pick up later on

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.280 
then just you know pick up later on
maybe<00:04:26.780> take<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> break<00:04:27.550> because<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.330> know<00:04:29.450> it's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
maybe take a break because you know it's

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.050 
maybe take a break because you know it's
kind<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.500> hard<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.710> record<00:04:31.130> for<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.550> long

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.760 

we're<00:04:35.690> not<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:35.900> much<00:04:36.020> hard<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:36.440> kind<00:04:36.740> of

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
we're not so much hard it just kind of

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.370 
we're not so much hard it just kind of
gets<00:04:36.889> redundant<00:04:37.550> after<00:04:38.180> wild<00:04:38.419> just<00:04:39.169> kind<00:04:39.320> of

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
gets redundant after wild just kind of

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:56.629 
gets redundant after wild just kind of
need<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> break

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.540 

and<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.590> yeah<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.889> think<00:05:00.039> that's<00:05:00.340> what<00:05:00.460> i'm

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
and so yeah I think that's what i'm

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.129 
and so yeah I think that's what i'm
going<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.729> do<00:05:00.849> from<00:05:01.030> now<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.210> just<00:05:01.960> kind<00:05:02.110> of

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
going to do from now on just kind of

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.480 
going to do from now on just kind of
take<00:05:02.319> a<00:05:02.349> break<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:02.770> between<00:05:04.289> all<00:05:05.289> right<00:05:05.860> so

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490
