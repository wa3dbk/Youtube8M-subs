foot or you could do both front feet and
you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.210> monitor<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.839> hinds<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.940> but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you can monitor the hinds as well but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
you can monitor the hinds as well but
once<00:00:42.119> you<00:00:42.239> understand<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.019> you'll<00:00:43.799> see

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
once you understand one you'll see

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
once you understand one you'll see
because<00:00:44.339> if<00:00:44.729> it<00:00:44.879> anything<00:00:45.210> any<00:00:45.839> problems

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
good but he's he's lost some depth of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
good but he's he's lost some depth of
concavity<00:01:43.260> see<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.190> horse<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
concavity see this horse will be that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.010 
concavity see this horse will be that
much<00:01:45.479> shorter<00:01:46.790> his<00:01:47.790> white<00:01:48.120> line<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.780> wants

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
much shorter his white line really wants

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.930 
much shorter his white line really wants
to<00:01:49.110> come<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.380> where<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.159> magic

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
to come out where I have that magic

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.660

Frog see his apex is really a false a
falsity<00:02:17.459> its<00:02:17.819> lifting<00:02:18.299> here<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.739> when<00:02:19.739> I

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
falsity its lifting here and when I

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.619 
falsity its lifting here and when I
start<00:02:20.099> backing<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.639> his<00:02:20.790> toe<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.359> going<00:02:21.569> to

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
start backing up his toe it's going to

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.220 
start backing up his toe it's going to
lift<00:02:21.840> even<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.409> because<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.799> going<00:02:22.950> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
lift even more because it's going to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.350 
lift even more because it's going to
seatback<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.459> he<00:02:24.610> doesn't<00:02:24.909> have<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> lot

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
seatback because he doesn't have a lot

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.680 
seatback because he doesn't have a lot
of<00:02:25.450> concavity<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.760> springtime<00:02:28.120> coming

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
of concavity so with springtime coming

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.520 
of concavity so with springtime coming
on<00:02:29.040> people<00:02:30.040> are<00:02:30.129> starting<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.580> warm<00:02:30.879> and<00:02:31.530> do

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
on people are starting to warm and do

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.699 
on people are starting to warm and do
vaccinations<00:02:33.340> my<00:02:33.730> best<00:02:34.060> advice<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.470> is

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
vaccinations my best advice to you is

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.080 
vaccinations my best advice to you is
don't<00:02:35.769> do<00:02:36.400> both<00:02:37.000> at<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.299> same<00:02:37.629> time<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.910> your

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
don't do both at the same time do your

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.500 
don't do both at the same time do your
vaccinations<00:02:41.069> monitor<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.849> bottom<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.420> your

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
vaccinations monitor the bottom of your

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.530 
vaccinations monitor the bottom of your
horse's<00:02:43.930> hoof<00:02:44.110> if<00:02:44.349> you<00:02:44.890> start<00:02:45.220> losing

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
horse's hoof if you start losing

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.809 
horse's hoof if you start losing
concavity<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.650> starts<00:02:48.010> going<00:02:48.160> flat<00:02:48.580> in

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
concavity and this starts going flat in

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.360 
concavity and this starts going flat in
through<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.450> see<00:02:49.690> your<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.290> bars<00:02:50.650> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
through here you see your your bars so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.119 
through here you see your your bars so
his<00:02:51.519> bars<00:02:51.849> actually<00:02:52.290> will<00:02:53.290> recede<00:02:53.739> more<00:02:54.010> and

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
his bars actually will recede more and

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.920 
his bars actually will recede more and
where<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.610> if<00:02:55.150> they<00:02:55.390> start<00:02:55.660> reaching

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
where they are if they start reaching

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.339 
where they are if they start reaching
out<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.530> here<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.780> digit<00:02:59.170> bar

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
out in here like this and this digit bar

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.930 
out in here like this and this digit bar
start<00:02:59.680> coming<00:03:00.040> forward<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.549> your<00:03:00.640> frog

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
start coming forward and your frog

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.420 
start coming forward and your frog
stretches<00:03:01.569> forward<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.140> here<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.590> you're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
stretches forward in here and you're

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.210 
stretches forward in here and you're
losing<00:03:03.609> concavity<00:03:04.569> your<00:03:05.410> horse<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.829> telling

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
losing concavity your horse is telling

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.940 
losing concavity your horse is telling
you<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.430> he's<00:03:06.819> having<00:03:07.060> problems<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
you that he's having problems so the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.759 
you that he's having problems so the
least<00:03:09.790> amount<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.660> things<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.079> put<00:03:11.379> onto<00:03:11.590> your

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
least amount of things you put onto your

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.280 
least amount of things you put onto your
horse<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.910> easier<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:14.049> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
horse the easier it is for you to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.330 
horse the easier it is for you to
determine<00:03:14.500> what<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.879> is<00:03:16.890> causing<00:03:17.890> it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
determine what it is that is causing it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.809 
determine what it is that is causing it
and<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:20.140> expect<00:03:20.560> your<00:03:20.739> farrier<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.340> monitor

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
and to expect your farrier to monitor

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.449 
and to expect your farrier to monitor
you<00:03:22.090> monitor<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:22.989> horse's<00:03:23.349> hoof<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.129> tell

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
you monitor your horse's hoof and tell

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.670 
you monitor your horse's hoof and tell
you<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:25.390> while<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.049> horse<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.410> having

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you that while your horse is having

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.770 
you that while your horse is having
problems<00:03:27.129> I've<00:03:27.639> been<00:03:27.910> seeing<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.299> for<00:03:28.510> years

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
problems I've been seeing this for years

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.089 
problems I've been seeing this for years
but<00:03:29.290> never<00:03:29.470> really<00:03:29.859> paid<00:03:30.040> attention<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.730> what

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
but never really paid attention to what

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.159 
but never really paid attention to what
exactly<00:03:33.099> what<00:03:33.310> time<00:03:33.579> of<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.760> year<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.090> was<00:03:34.299> but

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
exactly what time of the year it was but

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.199 
exactly what time of the year it was but
I<00:03:35.319> thought<00:03:35.590> I've<00:03:35.799> seen<00:03:36.040> horses<00:03:36.220> bars<00:03:36.790> go

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
I thought I've seen horses bars go

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.550 
I thought I've seen horses bars go
forward<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.780> then<00:03:37.959> when<00:03:38.109> they're<00:03:38.260> ready<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
forward and then when they're ready to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.720 
forward and then when they're ready to
come<00:03:38.739> off<00:03:38.799> when<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.280> start<00:03:39.519> gaining

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
come off when they start gaining

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.220 
come off when they start gaining
concavity<00:03:40.540> again<00:03:40.720> they're<00:03:40.900> ready<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.079> come

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
concavity again they're ready to come

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.870 
concavity again they're ready to come
off<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:41.530> take<00:03:41.709> them<00:03:41.829> off<00:03:42.010> bring<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> Frog<00:03:42.609> back

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
off I take them off bring the Frog back

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.839 
off I take them off bring the Frog back
but<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.900> know<00:03:44.019> why<00:03:44.560> are<00:03:44.859> these<00:03:45.010> horses<00:03:45.310> losing

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
but you know why are these horses losing

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.770 
but you know why are these horses losing
concavity<00:03:46.540> throughout<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.109> year<00:03:47.410> or<00:03:47.560> not

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
concavity throughout the year or not

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
concavity throughout the year or not
it's<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.870> big<00:03:50.049> thing<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.859> your<00:03:51.040> horses<00:03:51.519> bars

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
it's a big thing so if your horses bars

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.030 
it's a big thing so if your horses bars
grow<00:03:52.180> forward<00:03:52.930> like<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.470> here<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:53.919> your

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
grow forward like this here and your

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.710 
grow forward like this here and your
frog<00:03:54.280> stretches<00:03:54.790> forward<00:03:55.060> he<00:03:55.299> loses

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
frog stretches forward he loses

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.110 
frog stretches forward he loses
concavity<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.919> got<00:03:57.130> problems<00:03:59.160> so<00:04:00.160> it's<00:04:00.760> way

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
concavity you got problems so it's way

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.220 
concavity you got problems so it's way
better<00:04:01.329> if<00:04:01.569> you<00:04:01.720> monitor<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.410> yourself<00:04:03.010> check

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
better if you monitor it yourself check

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.119 
better if you monitor it yourself check
check<00:04:05.230> across<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:06.310> depth<00:04:06.810> all<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.290> Bowl<00:04:08.739> is

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
check across the depth all the Bowl is

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.599 
check across the depth all the Bowl is
to<00:04:09.430> here<00:04:10.620> you'll<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.829> some<00:04:11.859> horses<00:04:12.459> even

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
to here you'll see some horses even

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.610 
to here you'll see some horses even
though<00:04:12.879> they<00:04:13.090> they've<00:04:13.690> been<00:04:13.840> around<00:04:14.200> they<00:04:14.470> got

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
though they they've been around they got

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.860 
though they they've been around they got
lumps<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.099> bumps<00:04:15.160> down<00:04:15.549> through<00:04:15.849> here<00:04:16.209> no

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
lumps and bumps down through here no

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.569 
lumps and bumps down through here no
over<00:04:17.229> in<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.680> bowl<00:04:17.859> doesn't<00:04:18.250> come<00:04:18.400> all

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
over in here the bowl doesn't come all

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.699 
over in here the bowl doesn't come all
the<00:04:18.700> way<00:04:18.729> that's<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.900> because<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.320> toe<00:04:20.530> has

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
the way that's just because the toe has
