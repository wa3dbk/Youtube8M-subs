00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.169
 Video prepared by Andrea Gaming 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.169
 community gather ru 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.180
 what is the first game you remember when 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.900
 Mention of such genres as dange kral 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.220
 like in slash action lpg of course diablo 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.170
 and no matter what part 1 2 or 3 all 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.230
 they forced us to carry on in the game 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.720
 hundreds of hours but if people like that 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 remember the torchlight titan quest up 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.110
 gauntlet 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.449
 and yet when the choice remains before 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.610
 buying most of the players will bow 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.180
 to the blizzard project and that's where it comes from 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.629
 take it 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.820
 grinding gear games creeps out 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.430
 studio about which few people knew and now 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.430
 know many who played the fallen zile 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.780
 and some will choose is a free-to-play 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.150
 on these things but this is the first and smallest 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.670
 plus this game will tell about others 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.010
 later to start a sensitive story 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.700
 developers have joined in one studio 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.950
 2006 and already then plus or minus rather 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.950
 plus there were rumors about a project that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.830
 can smash diablo on the wall under 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.930
 codename shelves zile name 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.510
 has not changed and that's the year when 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.090
 they went out with bricks 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.740
 and there riders boobs and sense of duty 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.440
 dogs appeared our diablo like 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.840
 and at least everyone says yes and now 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.140
 called on the one hand it is very similar 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.690
 on the other hand there’s no Russian 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.880
 players felt it too well that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.400
 a small part that did not want to teach 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.830
 English others have successfully played 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.290
 they liked it and entrenched hearts 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.899
 and also in Russia there was a good one 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.509
 is a community game with you sites and so 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.619
 further so here is the whole thing decided 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.110
 translate garena 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.330
 and this is weird for me personally this 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 platform was like hamachi and can 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.560
 rather like tangl only with more 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.330
 extended functionality and remembered as 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.110
 it was cool to play cards 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.019
 warcraft 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.750
 say whether the tower defense board and here 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.820
 unexpectedly took up the translation of the game though 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.489
 there is a possibility that I missed this 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.440
 news when garena became something big 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.160
 than a simple program to play by 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.320
 lokalke 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.840
 and because of this they do not need to blame 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.450
 only praise his translation turned out 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 pretty good of course without a spoon of tar 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.100
 in a barrel of honey has not done but that's all 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.799
 only a small drop to which you can 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.590
 close your eyes pretty good at the team 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.850
 It turned out the voice quests are much better 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.709
 than the same skyforge 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.080
 it's not always the most important thing 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.150
 interesting plot and how it serves 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.920
 and as in other similar games all 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.530
 starts with choosing your character 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.870
 it is worth thinking about how you would like 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.930
 so that he looked after class tied 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.730
 to the floor physique have hairy style in 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.040
 in general, nothing will change 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.440
 and if you decide to play for a little 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.990
 buhalovo magata this decision is worth 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.540
 change the choice we will give shi of the heroes 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.000
 who are looking for adventure in their Ukraine 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.300
 Well, at the moment there is a real ass 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.320
 this is an old priest clever bandyugan mountain 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.960
 savage muscle 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.660
 usual hunter with shabby bow 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.630
 little witch and eternal gladiator 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.959
 duelist each has its own story of one 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.570
 betrayed another feared 3 just a thief 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.470
 but having arrived in the land of exiles 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.230
 everyone will start their new journey from the shore 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.300
 we find ourselves cast ashore because 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.910
 that the leaders on the ship so wanted 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.430
 thrown out about 20 people and up pl and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.070
 only you and yours 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.860
 the neighbor who died from the teeth of the dead 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.200
 after he was glad that he was alive 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.750
 the player will try to survive the local 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.500
 Wednesday where on every corner is guarding a pack 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.290
 evil beasts 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.250
 able to spit on fire then freeze 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 forever and ever 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.750
 surely master such small and not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 only pranks can even a warrior 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.280
 you don't need to choose before this mage 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.010
 just inserting your rune outfit 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.800
 fireball or that calls the dead 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.760
 and it is these very runes that make the game 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
 slightly different 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.350
 you will not be able to pump active 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.720
 experience skills are only passive for 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.510
 This has its own tree of skills and 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.030
 she is huge to understand him wrong 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.850
 difficult but understand exactly what is required 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.520
 it is hard for you to compose your 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.229
 the perfect build will have more than one day 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.660
 spend in the game and on the forum 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.790
 and to me with active abilities you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.040
 You will receive for quests and maybe 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.290
 future will be able to buy but on 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.810
 I’m not 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.180
 found and now goes everywhere such 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.950
 the trend is what exactly is your game you 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.270
 can change class 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.610
 no need to spend time creating 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.100
 new usb af for that too 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.620
 implemented just a little bit your own way 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.350
 for example, the same wanted to become a savage 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.840
 he will not succeed in building up such muscles 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.390
 will remain an old man but get dressed approximately 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.640
 like a savage take hands mace up fasten 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.620
 on melee runes he can 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.290
 just as strong in the beginning not 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.500
 because every class will be originally 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.570
 assigned to one or two characteristics 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.760
 power intellect and dexterity and every 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.100
 begins its place in the tree of skills 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.560
 the same savage will start a small flock 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.560
 passive on power and witch where on 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.110
 intelligence don't forget what else 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.000
 no money for past the shop where for real 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.730
 you can buy all sorts of buns 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.760
 we return to the ancient society when 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.190
 the cow was not given five gold 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.700
 another cow in general was changed to 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.310
 product 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.560
 of course here do not give a pledge sword but not 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.320
 which is also important and all sorts of scrolls for 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.560
 recognition of the subject of the scope of improvement 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.870
 fragments and the like in one word 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.270
 it is not worth going past the game even 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.870
 due to the fact that there are common locations 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.400
 you can see other players on them 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.350
 trade will remove invite to group 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.700
 it's always more fun and faster 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.280
 go with someone 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.280
 Well, or call for arms, that is, pvp 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.650
 This was very lacking in such games. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.650
 when in one run bend down the crowd 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.640
 you destroy enemies with one blow 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.560
 army of monsters 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.170
 sometimes you want to fight against 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.960
 dark opponents who are also like you 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.350
 strong and able to kill you already 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.350
 hitting 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.260
 fixed collects all the most 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.199
 the best that was in the second diablo and 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.610
 gives a lot of new and interesting 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.740
 It felt all the same when I made the game 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.010
 not 23 years old but 7 years old 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.900
 yet in 2013 she won many and 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.270
 now does it again 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.400
 it's not for nothing that many say what 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.400
 such was supposed to be diablo 3 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.599
 and
