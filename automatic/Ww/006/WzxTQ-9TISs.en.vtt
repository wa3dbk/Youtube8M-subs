00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
even if we do them badly why it depends

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
even if we do them badly why it depends
on<00:01:01.530> each<00:01:01.679> horse<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.190> sort<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> i'll<00:01:03.209> check

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
