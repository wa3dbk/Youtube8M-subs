00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 all like that I have two months 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.740
 the opta has two years in a row 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.040
 that is not like it 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.190
 we look i would explain the same story i was asked a girlfriend 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.609
 and her 16 year internship at the eleventh time fit 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.029
 and that organized the evening yesterday as Amsterdam 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.199
 at the crime 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.890
 red card against the closure 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.689
 Because we are going and I really do not know what is waiting for me 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 encountered acts on the site on the left 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 but i don't know how to walk that night itself but it was a lot of fun 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.370
 but the thing is that we will win 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.770
 but got on the whole week in a row 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.750
 the st we think is coming 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.830
 9 the om also looks very nice 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.270
 I was 36 and 40 in total 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 and last also is that it is actually the fourth set 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.800
 the star from valkenswaard 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 the top ten first 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.770
 he is really a website 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.610
 and that is difficult 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.010
 brain demands high streets the competition is a bit learned from form 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.160
 and this was also here the sale was enough there is the percentage off alone 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.700
 knew from the house brand of 3 the first half then bit tjerk thinks 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 m i think this sujet has so much rain as this segment 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.620
 to halt 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.580
 the a28 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.890
 it is not really talent and this was know afterwards 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.950
 said the preses 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.990
 and this is also planning 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.170
 then I thought 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.549
 I am happy with this effects relief, I also have a black t-shirt with 28 percent 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.570
 higher on 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.720
 but I like it so much and this one couldn't help it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.670
 he was reimbursed to 22 euros afterwards 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.580
 for statistics 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.130
 this morning four people after his team but I work 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.650
 that they are this 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.950
 mint green 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 but these were 10 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 boaters relief 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.840
 also per person per barrel 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.480
 that is it 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.870
 and I have this one 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.579
 always better deployed 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.579
 I will of course show myself a sausage being 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.039
 in April 1974 at the city 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:20.849
 4 8 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.309
 by these messages 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.849
 an agent was not opposed to this 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.719
 Mark is working hard to help and thereby choosing from a turn in the 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.079
 chain 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.079
 they would also show some close up 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.099
 and then you have another 4 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.689
 and that is all I bought is not super much but I myself am a tip 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.329
 to be 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.509
 and because supermarkets just got to go just as well 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.789
 packages with water in may 2006 patrick this class 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.979
 they have turkish power 9 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 squatters are unusual 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.309
 but I think that's the parents 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.409
 and that may also be free of charge anp 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.689
 it might be a tip then church he is a bag initiative about it 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.409
 March I am not sure I often eat it 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.569
