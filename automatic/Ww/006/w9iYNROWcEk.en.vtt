00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and then the you can take you can use a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
and then the you can take you can use a
funnel<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.900> optional<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:35.070> not

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
funnel but that is optional you do not

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
funnel but that is optional you do not
have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> use<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.000> depending<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
