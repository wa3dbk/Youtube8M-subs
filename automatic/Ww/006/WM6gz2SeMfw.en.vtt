00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.309 

okay<00:00:02.120> morph<00:00:03.120> targets<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:05.810> morph<00:00:06.810> target<00:00:07.170> is

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
okay morph targets a morph target is

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.640 
okay morph targets a morph target is
very<00:00:07.890> useful<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> fact<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.330> can

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
very useful in the fact that you can

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.990 
very useful in the fact that you can
rewind<00:00:10.650> some<00:00:11.250> data<00:00:11.490> okay<00:00:12.500> so<00:00:13.670> here's<00:00:14.670> how<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
rewind some data okay so here's how it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.279 
rewind some data okay so here's how it
works<00:00:15.590> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:16.980> initial<00:00:17.580> state<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.539> we'll

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
works this is my initial state or we'll

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.980 
works this is my initial state or we'll
pretend<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.100> initial<00:00:20.310> state<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.990> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
pretend this in my initial state and I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.029 
pretend this in my initial state and I
can<00:00:22.260> go<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.369> morph<00:00:23.730> target

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
can go in here and go to morph target

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.640 
can go in here and go to morph target
store<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> morph<00:00:26.460> target<00:00:27.740> ok<00:00:29.779> now<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:31.080> say<00:00:31.619> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
store a morph target ok now let's say I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
store a morph target ok now let's say I
change<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> match<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.450> let's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
change up the match a little bit let's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:54.710 
change up the match a little bit let's
say<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:37.100> move<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.430> stuff

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.430 

and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.470> go<00:00:55.650> back<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:56.990> okay<00:00:58.910> now<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.200> my<00:01:01.200> morph

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and then go back up okay now in my morph

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
and then go back up okay now in my morph
target<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.580> ability<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.060> morph

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
target I have the ability to morph

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530 
target I have the ability to morph
between<00:01:04.440> those<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.340> can<00:01:05.550> morph<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
between those so I can morph to the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.780 
between those so I can morph to the
initial<00:01:06.810> state<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.740> morph<00:01:08.160> beyond<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
initial state or morph beyond the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.900 
initial state or morph beyond the
initial<00:01:08.880> state<00:01:09.420> okay<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> layer<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
initial state okay just like a layer the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.820 
initial state okay just like a layer the
difference<00:01:12.300> between<00:01:12.450> Morphin<00:01:13.140> layer<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.620> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
difference between Morphin layer is I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
difference between Morphin layer is I
can<00:01:14.070> only<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.970> fat<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.540> layers

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
can only have one more fat a time layers

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.220 
can only have one more fat a time layers
i<00:01:16.410> could<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.710> several<00:01:17.070> layers

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.210 

okay<00:01:28.200> everything<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.320> this<00:01:29.530> Santa<00:01:29.770> later<00:01:29.980> so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
okay everything is this Santa later so

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.850 
okay everything is this Santa later so
or<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.610> morph<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:31.720> i<00:01:32.080> went<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.500> initial

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
or a morph so if i went to the initial

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.780 
or a morph so if i went to the initial
state<00:01:33.220> again<00:01:33.490> let's<00:01:33.970> say<00:01:34.090> delete<00:01:34.510> this<00:01:35.790> store

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
state again let's say delete this store

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.400 
state again let's say delete this store
it<00:01:36.910> again<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:37.810> what<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.140> will<00:01:38.260> do

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
it again and that that what that will do

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.610 
it again and that that what that will do
is<00:01:38.440> make<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.220> i<00:01:39.460> don't<00:01:39.940> have<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:41.320> morph

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
is make it so i don't have the the morph

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.660 
is make it so i don't have the the morph
anymore<00:01:42.060> ok<00:01:45.990> well<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.220> sniff<00:01:48.550> t

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
anymore ok well there's a sniff t

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.180 
anymore ok well there's a sniff t
feature<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.210> does<00:01:49.360> not<00:01:49.510> exist<00:01:49.660> on<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.050> layer

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.340 

let's<00:01:54.190> say<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.910> go<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.510> here<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:55.840> add<00:01:56.170> some

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
let's say I go in here and add some

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:10.139 
let's say I go in here and add some
noise<00:01:56.530> this

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.410 

and<00:02:10.269> then<00:02:11.079> add<00:02:11.319> some<00:02:11.560> other<00:02:11.709> stuff<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.220> it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.010 

sure<00:02:17.050> let's<00:02:17.349> clip<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.599> love<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:19.780> clip

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
sure let's clip it to love this clip

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:35.460 
sure let's clip it to love this clip
brush<00:02:20.290> as<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.650> could<00:02:20.800> tell

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.880 

okay<00:02:36.340> now<00:02:36.730> there's<00:02:37.270> something<00:02:37.780> here<00:02:38.260> called

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
okay now there's something here called

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.110 
okay now there's something here called
the<00:02:39.220> morph<00:02:39.520> brush<00:02:41.100> ok<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.550> morph<00:02:42.820> brush

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
the morph brush ok and the morph brush

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.770 
the morph brush ok and the morph brush
will<00:02:43.360> take<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.720> back<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.100> used<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.490> be

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
will take it back to what it used to be

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.700 
will take it back to what it used to be
say<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.980> start<00:02:47.980> drawing<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:48.700> area<00:02:49.410> well<00:02:50.410> if

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
say I start drawing in this area well if

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:01.090 
say I start drawing in this area well if
I<00:02:50.980> keep<00:02:51.250> drawing

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.370 

it<00:03:01.670> will<00:03:01.790> take<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.180> back<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.570> into<00:03:02.930> initial

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
it will take it back to into initial

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.230 
it will take it back to into initial
state<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.890> ball<00:03:04.100> where<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> stored<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.180> the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
state of a ball where I stored in the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.050 
state of a ball where I stored in the
morph<00:03:05.420> target<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.740> that's<00:03:07.040> pretty<00:03:07.580> neat<00:03:07.880> in

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
morph target so that's pretty neat in

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.730 
morph target so that's pretty neat in
the<00:03:08.180> fact<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> brush

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
the fact that you know you have a brush

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.850 
the fact that you know you have a brush
that<00:03:10.160> kind<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.490> goes<00:03:10.640> back<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:11.240> time<00:03:11.860> depending

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
that kind of goes back in time depending

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.980 
that kind of goes back in time depending
upon<00:03:12.950> where<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.460> start<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:13.910> morph<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.390> you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
upon where you start to morph and you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.900 
upon where you start to morph and you
can<00:03:15.140> store<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.500> morph<00:03:15.740> at<00:03:15.860> any<00:03:16.070> time<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.790> know

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
can store the morph at any time you know

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.880 
can store the morph at any time you know
I<00:03:16.940> mean<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.990> I<00:03:18.140> could<00:03:18.290> have<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> huge

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
I mean so like I could have the huge

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.800 
I mean so like I could have the huge
change<00:03:19.370> here<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.210> begin<00:03:20.390> with<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.660> can

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
change here to begin with and I can

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.890 
change here to begin with and I can
store<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.050> morph<00:03:24.350> target<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.330> i'll<00:03:26.420> delete<00:03:26.690> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
store a morph target so i'll delete this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:36.280 
store a morph target so i'll delete this
one<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.200> store<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.440> new<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:33.590> i<00:03:35.290> can

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
one in store a new one and then i can

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.420 
one in store a new one and then i can
add<00:03:36.440> some<00:03:36.680> tomfoolery<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.880> like<00:03:38.480> some<00:03:39.430> form

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
add some tomfoolery to it like some form

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.610 
add some tomfoolery to it like some form
brush

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.589 

let's<00:03:46.340> say<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.519> go<00:03:46.549> all<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:47.060> bounds<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.450> the

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
let's say I go all the bounds of the

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:59.480 
let's say I go all the bounds of the
form<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.349> I<00:03:48.530> go<00:03:48.709> way<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.010> here

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:14.610 

well<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.660> i<00:04:00.870> take<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.500> morph<00:04:02.160> brush

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.460 

I<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:15.340> choose<00:04:15.610> where<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.000> want<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.630> that

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
I can choose where I want that that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:28.770 
I can choose where I want that that
morph<00:04:21.449> very<00:04:22.449> very<00:04:22.900> useful<00:04:23.350> very<00:04:23.590> useful<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:27.780> I

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
morph very very useful very useful and I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.780 
morph very very useful very useful and I
can<00:04:28.930> even<00:04:29.020> flatten<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:29.590> back<00:04:29.830> out<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.580> if<00:04:30.699> I

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
can even flatten this back out so if I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.740 
can even flatten this back out so if I
want<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.030> surface<00:04:31.389> that's<00:04:31.419> always<00:04:31.930> flat<00:04:32.610> and

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
want a surface that's always flat and

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.420 
want a surface that's always flat and
keep<00:04:34.750> repairing<00:04:35.229> it<00:04:35.320> over<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.680> over<00:04:35.740> again<00:04:36.010> I

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
keep repairing it over and over again I

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.430 
keep repairing it over and over again I
could<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.240> store<00:04:37.419> morph<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:37.990> it's<00:04:38.139> flat

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
could just store morph when it's flat

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.000 
could just store morph when it's flat
and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.940> can<00:04:40.350> you<00:04:41.350> know<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.590> feel<00:04:41.979> free

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
and then I can you know I can feel free

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.640 
and then I can you know I can feel free
about<00:04:42.430> adding<00:04:42.820> texture<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.540> entire<00:04:43.870> rest

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
about adding texture to the entire rest

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.860 
about adding texture to the entire rest
of<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.860> mesh<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.430> just<00:04:46.000> fix<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.419> one<00:04:46.600> flat

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
of the mesh and just fix that one flat

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.560 
of the mesh and just fix that one flat
point<00:04:47.199> case<00:04:47.889> in<00:04:48.070> point<00:04:48.100> let's<00:04:49.060> say<00:04:49.210> I<00:04:49.240> wanted

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
point case in point let's say I wanted

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.770 
point case in point let's say I wanted
to<00:04:49.660> readd<00:04:49.990> some<00:04:50.229> noise<00:04:50.410> into<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.919> area<00:04:54.780> okay

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
to readd some noise into this area okay

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.170 
to readd some noise into this area okay
oops<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.039> made<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.250> mistake<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.850> got<00:04:58.000> some

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
oops I made a mistake and I got some

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.300 
oops I made a mistake and I got some
noise<00:04:58.360> over<00:04:58.539> here<00:04:58.660> what<00:04:59.620> should<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.070> do<00:05:00.190> about

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
noise over here what should I do about

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.310 
noise over here what should I do about
it<00:05:00.699> well<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.210> could<00:05:01.539> go<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.840> morph<00:05:02.050> brush

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
it well I could go to the morph brush

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.020 
it well I could go to the morph brush
and<00:05:02.590> then<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:03.639> can<00:05:03.850> carefully<00:05:04.360> go<00:05:04.810> in<00:05:04.960> here<00:05:05.260> and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
and then I can carefully go in here and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.950 
and then I can carefully go in here and
fade<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.240> out<00:05:08.250> okay<00:05:11.039> so<00:05:12.210> that's<00:05:13.210> usefulness

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
fade that out okay so that's usefulness

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.600 
fade that out okay so that's usefulness
of<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.199> more

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.969 

ok<00:05:19.389> now<00:05:19.719> that<00:05:19.900> we<00:05:20.020> see<00:05:20.229> what<00:05:20.439> more<00:05:20.650> can<00:05:20.830> do

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
ok now that we see what more can do

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.180 
ok now that we see what more can do
let's<00:05:21.310> go<00:05:21.460> on<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.699> next<00:05:21.909> video
