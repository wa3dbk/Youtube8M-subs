probably<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.890> England<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.970> opinion

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
probably in all of England in my opinion

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
probably in all of England in my opinion
so<00:01:40.020> let's<00:01:40.259> dive<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.590> into<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.310> now

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so let's dive right into this thing now

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
so let's dive right into this thing now
the<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:42.150> first<00:01:42.360> floor<00:01:42.659> album<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> ever

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the very first floor album that I ever

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
the very first floor album that I ever
got<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.700> tank<00:01:45.000> their<00:01:45.299> most<00:01:45.479> recent

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
got was think tank their most recent

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
got was think tank their most recent
album<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.409> released<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.130> 2003<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.299> was

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
album was released in 2003 that was

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
album was released in 2003 that was
probably<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.409> best<00:01:49.439> place<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> start

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
probably not the best place to start

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
probably not the best place to start
because<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.970> album<00:01:51.210> Graham<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.899> already

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
because on that album Graham had already

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
because on that album Graham had already
left<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> band<00:01:52.710> due<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.040> him<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> Damon

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
left the band due to him and Damon

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.859 
left the band due to him and Damon
having<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:54.960> arguments<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> know

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
future projects and stuff like that so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 
future projects and stuff like that so

this album was like flourish the worst

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.390 
this album was like flourish the worst
work<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:27.290> could<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.709> tell<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.280> was<00:02:28.370> a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
work you could really tell that it was a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.430 
work you could really tell that it was a
debut<00:02:28.849> album<00:02:28.879> it<00:02:29.720> wasn't<00:02:30.019> anything<00:02:30.200> special

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
debut album it wasn't anything special

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.559 
debut album it wasn't anything special
about<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.129> but<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> only<00:02:31.819> reason<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.209> I

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
about it but the only reason I think I

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.119 
about it but the only reason I think I
thought<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.140> way<00:02:33.290> because<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:33.950> already

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
thought that way because I was already

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.570 
thought that way because I was already
spoiled<00:02:34.610> by<00:02:35.000> blurs<00:02:35.480> other<00:02:36.110> work<00:02:36.500> which<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.519> a

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
spoiled by blurs other work which was a

spoiled by blurs other work which was a
lot<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:37.970> technical<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> lot<00:02:39.379> more

of<00:05:17.590> this<00:05:17.770> song<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:19.270> sounds<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:19.870> get

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
of this song and the sounds that I get

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.380 
of this song and the sounds that I get
the<00:05:20.290> guitar<00:05:20.620> in<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.950> background<00:05:21.130> slow<00:05:22.090> down

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
the guitar in the background slow down

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.440 
the guitar in the background slow down
almost<00:05:23.320> has<00:05:23.530> like<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.830> noise<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.160> rock<00:05:24.610> influence

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
almost has like a noise a rock influence

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.480 
almost has like a noise a rock influence
behind<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.110> really<00:05:26.500> really<00:05:26.650> fuzzy<00:05:26.979> guitars

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
behind it is really really fuzzy guitars

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.320 
behind it is really really fuzzy guitars
and<00:05:27.880> really<00:05:28.180> human<00:05:28.630> big<00:05:29.169> fuzzy<00:05:29.680> saddle

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
and really human big fuzzy saddle

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.640 
and really human big fuzzy saddle
repetition<00:05:31.330> has<00:05:31.540> like<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.900> really<00:05:32.200> repetitive

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
repetition has like a really repetitive

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.680 
repetition has like a really repetitive
keyboard<00:05:33.520> part<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:33.940> just<00:05:34.120> keeps<00:05:34.330> going<00:05:34.600> on

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
keyboard part that just keeps going on

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.559 
keyboard part that just keeps going on
and<00:05:34.750> on<00:05:34.960> forever

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
and on forever

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.389 
and on forever
but<00:05:35.809> it<00:05:35.929> isn't<00:05:36.529> completely<00:05:36.860> repetitive

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:37.399 
but it isn't completely repetitive

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.339 
but it isn't completely repetitive
because<00:05:37.580> there<00:05:37.939> are<00:05:38.089> a<00:05:38.119> few<00:05:38.569> times<00:05:38.990> with<00:05:39.229> the

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
because there are a few times with the

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.959 
because there are a few times with the
song<00:05:39.529> actually<00:05:39.740> changes<00:05:40.399> up<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.639> little<00:05:40.789> bit

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
song actually changes up a little bit

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.329 
song actually changes up a little bit
which<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.240> nice<00:05:41.479> bad<00:05:42.110> day<00:05:42.439> is<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.740> really<00:05:43.099> cool

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
harmonic good beginning and has some

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.559 
harmonic good beginning and has some
really<00:05:45.770> great<00:05:46.069> lyrics<00:05:46.520> being<00:05:47.209> that<00:05:47.419> they're

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
really great lyrics being that they're

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.109 
really great lyrics being that they're
still<00:05:47.809> simple<00:05:48.229> once<00:05:48.469> again<00:05:48.860> high<00:05:49.520> cool<00:05:49.849> is

probably<00:05:50.419> my<00:05:50.539> least<00:05:50.719> favorite<00:05:51.110> song<00:05:51.259> in<00:05:51.409> this

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 
probably my least favorite song in this

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:52.719 
probably my least favorite song in this
album<00:05:51.649> there's<00:05:52.039> nothing<00:05:52.309> really<00:05:52.429> special

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
album there's nothing really special

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.429 
album there's nothing really special
about<00:05:53.029> it<00:05:53.300> but<00:05:53.449> was<00:05:53.539> really<00:05:53.749> cool<00:05:53.929> come

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
about it but was really cool come

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.379 
about it but was really cool come
together<00:05:54.649> every<00:05:55.610> single<00:05:55.699> time<00:05:55.969> I<00:05:56.059> say<00:05:56.179> that<00:05:56.209> I

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
together every single time I say that I

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.879 
together every single time I say that I
just<00:05:56.659> think<00:05:56.809> of<00:05:56.929> a<00:05:56.990> Beatles<00:05:57.319> song<00:05:57.379> but<00:05:57.770> it's

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
just think of a Beatles song but it's

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.010 
just think of a Beatles song but it's
not<00:05:58.069> here<00:05:58.429> as<00:05:58.550> good<00:05:58.759> as<00:05:58.879> the<00:05:58.999> Beatles<00:05:59.270> song<00:05:59.479> but

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
not here as good as the Beatles song but

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.510 
not here as good as the Beatles song but
still<00:06:00.259> for<00:06:00.409> this<00:06:00.529> album<00:06:00.770> it's<00:06:01.069> actually<00:06:01.369> one

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
still for this album it's actually one

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.519 
still for this album it's actually one
of<00:06:01.550> my<00:06:01.669> favorite<00:06:01.999> songs<00:06:02.119> because<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.229> enjoyed

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
of my favorite songs because I enjoyed

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.040 
of my favorite songs because I enjoyed
the<00:06:03.589> chorus<00:06:03.919> so<00:06:04.069> much<00:06:04.339> full<00:06:04.909> birthday<00:06:05.599> wearing

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
the chorus so much full birthday wearing

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.600 
the chorus so much full birthday wearing
me<00:06:06.139> down<00:06:06.169> those<00:06:06.649> round<00:06:06.949> out<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:07.309> ending<00:06:07.490> of

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
me down those round out the ending of

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.399 
me down those round out the ending of
the<00:06:07.699> album<00:06:08.029> it<00:06:08.569> kind<00:06:08.779> of<00:06:08.809> gets<00:06:08.990> a<00:06:09.080> little<00:06:09.229> bit

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
the album it kind of gets a little bit

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.499 
the album it kind of gets a little bit
slower<00:06:09.709> especially<00:06:09.979> on<00:06:10.520> birthday<00:06:11.029> but<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.389> has

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
slower especially on birthday but it has

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.389 
slower especially on birthday but it has
a<00:06:11.539> really<00:06:11.930> explosive<00:06:12.379> climax<00:06:12.649> at<00:06:13.129> the<00:06:13.219> very

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:13.399 
a really explosive climax at the very

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.309 
a really explosive climax at the very
end<00:06:13.639> so<00:06:13.939> yeah<00:06:14.270> like<00:06:14.479> I<00:06:14.539> said<00:06:14.659> when<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.080> first

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
end so yeah like I said when I first

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.320 
end so yeah like I said when I first
heard<00:06:15.499> this<00:06:15.680> thing<00:06:15.889> I<00:06:16.189> thought<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.789> was<00:06:16.939> awful

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
heard this thing I thought it was awful

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.089 
heard this thing I thought it was awful
I<00:06:17.569> didn't<00:06:18.229> like<00:06:18.349> it<00:06:18.589> at<00:06:18.680> all

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
I didn't like it at all

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.279 
I didn't like it at all
but<00:06:19.309> after<00:06:19.580> relisting<00:06:20.209> to<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:20.539> just<00:06:20.779> like<00:06:21.110> a

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
but after relisting to it just like a

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.309 
but after relisting to it just like a
day<00:06:21.649> ago<00:06:21.680> I<00:06:22.339> gotta<00:06:23.209> say<00:06:23.389> it's<00:06:23.749> really<00:06:24.020> good
