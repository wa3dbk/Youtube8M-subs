you

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.110 

what's<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.080> most<00:00:12.290> important<00:00:12.980> moment<00:00:13.340> of<00:00:13.400> any

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
what's the most important moment of any

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.410 
what's the most important moment of any
tennis<00:00:14.840> shot<00:00:15.129> well<00:00:16.129> I<00:00:16.160> would<00:00:16.460> say<00:00:16.700> it's<00:00:17.180> that

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
tennis shot well I would say it's that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.109 
tennis shot well I would say it's that
four<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.990> five<00:00:18.200> milliseconds<00:00:18.950> that<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.880> ball

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
four to five milliseconds that the ball

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.940 
four to five milliseconds that the ball
is<00:00:20.330> in<00:00:20.420> contact<00:00:20.930> with<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.259> strings<00:00:21.590> if

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
is in contact with the strings if

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.040 
is in contact with the strings if
everything<00:00:22.610> else<00:00:22.700> is<00:00:22.939> good<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:23.720> that's<00:00:23.840> not

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
everything else is good but that's not

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.859 
everything else is good but that's not
right<00:00:24.439> you're<00:00:25.310> not<00:00:25.580> winning<00:00:26.150> in<00:00:26.449> tennis

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
right you're not winning in tennis

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.410 
right you're not winning in tennis
that's<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.859> most<00:00:28.039> important<00:00:28.580> moment<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.060> any

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
that's the most important moment of any

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.380 
that's the most important moment of any
tennis<00:00:29.869> shot<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:30.619> what<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:31.400> means<00:00:31.699> for<00:00:31.910> us<00:00:32.059> is

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
tennis shot so what that means for us is

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.680 
tennis shot so what that means for us is
timing<00:00:33.260> is<00:00:33.440> everything<00:00:34.390> it's<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.540> most

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
timing is everything it's the most

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.689 
timing is everything it's the most
important<00:00:36.230> we're<00:00:36.379> shooting<00:00:36.830> for<00:00:36.980> good<00:00:37.190> timing

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
important we're shooting for good timing

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.990 
important we're shooting for good timing
that's<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.330> goal<00:00:38.629> for<00:00:38.989> us<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.320> achieve<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.000> like

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
that's a goal for us to achieve and like

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000 
that's a goal for us to achieve and like
any<00:00:41.269> goal<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:42.170> need<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.530> have<00:00:42.649> a<00:00:42.680> good

definition to tell us what we're
shooting<00:00:45.050> for<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.399> goal<00:00:46.670> or<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
definition of timing is a centered

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.950 
definition of timing is a centered
impact<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:52.670> good<00:00:52.910> relationship<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.809> your

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
parts the first part is general timing

parts the first part is general timing
the<00:01:10.190> second<00:01:10.640> part<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.149> all<00:01:11.360> about<00:01:11.660> specific

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
the second part is all about specific

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.100 
the second part is all about specific
timing<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:16.280> timing<00:01:16.369> also<00:01:16.880> has<00:01:17.299> technical

timing the timing also has technical

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.480 
timing the timing also has technical
aspects<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:18.890> well<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.520> tactical<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:21.310> great<00:01:22.310> way

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
aspects as well as tactical a great way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.490 
aspects as well as tactical a great way
to<00:01:22.520> visualize<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.420> technical<00:01:23.960> aspect<00:01:24.350> of

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
to visualize the technical aspect of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.230 
to visualize the technical aspect of
timing<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.460> imagine<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:26.000> three-dimensional

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
timing is to imagine a three-dimensional

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.170 
timing is to imagine a three-dimensional
box<00:01:27.110> floating<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.040> ideal<00:01:28.520> place<00:01:28.939> to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
maneuver your box so the ball crosses

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.109 
maneuver your box so the ball crosses
through<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:51.130> impacting<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> ball<00:01:52.430> below<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.080 
too far outside too early or too late
all<00:01:59.270> translates<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.380> poor<00:02:00.619> timing<00:02:01.159> but<00:02:01.850> if<00:02:01.970> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
all translates to poor timing but if you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.080 
all translates to poor timing but if you
Center<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.780> ball<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.070> box<00:02:04.310> that's

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
Center the ball in the box that's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.630 
Center the ball in the box that's
perfect<00:02:05.960> timing

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.490 

that's<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.939> technical<00:02:15.480> aspect<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.079> timing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that's the technical aspect of timing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.979 
that's the technical aspect of timing
when<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.220> comes<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> tactical<00:02:18.390> aspect<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
when it comes to the tactical aspect of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.950 
when it comes to the tactical aspect of
timing<00:02:19.409> there<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.799> two<00:02:20.069> key<00:02:20.459> elements

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
timing there are two key elements

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.600 
timing there are two key elements
the<00:02:23.960> first<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.590> whether<00:02:24.800> you're<00:02:25.010> taking<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
the first is whether you're taking the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.540 
the first is whether you're taking the
ball<00:02:26.170> when<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.320> falling<00:02:28.210> at<00:02:29.210> its<00:02:29.510> peak<00:02:29.930> or<00:02:30.860> on

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
ball when it's falling at its peak or on

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.410 
ball when it's falling at its peak or on
the<00:02:32.390> rise

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the rise

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.460 
the rise
each<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.690> these<00:02:35.870> are<00:02:36.080> four<00:02:36.290> different

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
each of these are four different

tactical intentions for example letting
it<00:02:39.230> fall<00:02:39.470> may<00:02:39.830> gain<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.250> time<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.760> hit<00:02:40.880> a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
it fall may gain you time to hit a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.570 
it fall may gain you time to hit a
higher-quality<00:02:41.360> shot<00:02:42.130> taking<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.400> rise

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
higher-quality shot taking on the rise

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.550 
higher-quality shot taking on the rise
however<00:02:44.120> may<00:02:44.390> allow<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.900> take<00:02:45.260> time<00:02:45.530> away

you and the ball for your impact but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.550 
you and the ball for your impact but
it's<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.500> intended<00:03:19.040> shot<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.900> tactic

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it's for the intended shot so the tactic

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.290 
it's for the intended shot so the tactic
that<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.770> have<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.490> going<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> require

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
that you have is going to require

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.390 
that you have is going to require
specific<00:03:23.690> timing<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.770> would<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.130> for

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
specific timing there would be for

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400 
specific timing there would be for
example<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.970> different<00:03:26.240> impact<00:03:26.810> point<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.230> I'm

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
example a different impact point if I'm

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.740 
example a different impact point if I'm

topspin angle cross-court there would be

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.170 
topspin angle cross-court there would be

some variation in that impact point and

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.180 
some variation in that impact point and
that's<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.780> specific<00:03:39.050> timing<00:03:39.710> for<00:03:40.100> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
that's the specific timing for the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
rally shot notice the change if we

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.480 
rally shot notice the change if we

when I am making that impact point where
the<00:04:02.890> shot<00:04:03.160> goes<00:04:03.490> is<00:04:03.880> all<00:04:04.360> about<00:04:04.660> what<00:04:04.840> we<00:04:04.930> call

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
the shot goes is all about what we call

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.860 
the shot goes is all about what we call
the<00:04:05.170> past<00:04:05.620> principles<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.150> path<00:04:07.480> of

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
the past principles so it's the path of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.840 
off we need to understand that tennis is
a<00:04:55.090> game<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.570> receiving<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.500> then<00:04:57.220> sending

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
a game of receiving and then sending

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.690 
a game of receiving and then sending
it's<00:04:58.330> not<00:04:58.540> like<00:04:58.690> I'm<00:04:58.810> learning<00:04:58.930> golf<00:04:59.700> the

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
it's not like I'm learning golf the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.320 
it's not like I'm learning golf the
challenge<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.420> timing<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.020> about<00:05:03.300> reception

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
challenge of timing is about reception

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.909 
challenge of timing is about reception
it's<00:05:04.960> about<00:05:05.550> adaptation<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.790> balls<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.540> are

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
it's about adaptation to balls that are

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.130 
it's about adaptation to balls that are
shorter<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.130> higher<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.910> wider<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.660> spinny

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
shorter and higher and wider and spinny

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.010 
shorter and higher and wider and spinny
er<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.560> I'm<00:05:12.220> trying<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.760> maintain<00:05:13.000> my<00:05:13.480> timing

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
er and I'm trying to maintain my timing

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.110 
er and I'm trying to maintain my timing
with<00:05:14.320> all<00:05:14.620> those<00:05:15.040> adjustments<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:15.850> have

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
with all those adjustments that I have

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.050 
with all those adjustments that I have
to<00:05:16.300> make<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:17.290> is<00:05:17.650> one<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.250> key<00:05:18.490> points

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
to make that is one of the key points

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.590 
to make that is one of the key points
it's<00:05:19.930> receiving<00:05:20.530> not<00:05:20.919> sending<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:22.450> other

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
it's receiving not sending the other

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.230 
it's receiving not sending the other
point<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.320> is<00:05:23.560> this<00:05:23.980> because<00:05:24.580> timing<00:05:24.970> is

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
point is that is this because timing is

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.480 
point is that is this because timing is
the<00:05:25.360> key<00:05:26.290> thing<00:05:26.710> that<00:05:26.800> you're<00:05:26.919> trying<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.250> do

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
the key thing that you're trying to do

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.090 
the key thing that you're trying to do
that's<00:05:28.060> why<00:05:28.360> we<00:05:28.570> do<00:05:28.750> everything<00:05:29.320> else<00:05:29.470> why<00:05:30.040> do

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
that's why we do everything else why do

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.200 
that's why we do everything else why do
you<00:05:30.280> think<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.669> have<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:30.940> have<00:05:30.970> good

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
you think you have to have good

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.060 
you think you have to have good
preparation<00:05:31.570> why<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.140> your<00:05:32.410> footwork<00:05:32.740> got<00:05:32.950> to

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
preparation why is your footwork got to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.530 
preparation why is your footwork got to
be<00:05:33.160> there<00:05:33.310> why<00:05:33.490> are<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.730> watching<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.360> ball

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
be there why are you watching the ball

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.440 
be there why are you watching the ball
and<00:05:34.750> tracking<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.350> all<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:36.850> function

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
and tracking it all that is in function

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.040 
and tracking it all that is in function
of<00:05:37.600> trying<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.740> create<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:40.090> perfect<00:05:40.570> timing

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
of trying to create the perfect timing

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.960 
of trying to create the perfect timing
that's<00:05:41.620> why<00:05:41.890> you<00:05:41.950> even<00:05:42.310> do<00:05:42.520> all<00:05:42.730> those<00:05:42.910> other

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
that's why you even do all those other

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.490 
that's why you even do all those other
things<00:05:43.390> that<00:05:43.570> coach<00:05:43.750> have<00:05:43.990> talked<00:05:44.140> about<00:05:44.380> over

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
things that coach have talked about over

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.230 
things that coach have talked about over
the<00:05:44.620> years<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.040> they're<00:05:45.160> all<00:05:45.280> important<00:05:45.880> but

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
the years and they're all important but

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.690 
the years and they're all important but
they're<00:05:46.720> for<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.590> reason<00:05:48.040> it's<00:05:48.190> for<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.520> make

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
they're for a reason it's for to make

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.960 
they're for a reason it's for to make
the<00:05:48.970> timing<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:50.370> final<00:05:51.370> point<00:05:51.610> is<00:05:51.790> this

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
the timing and the final point is this

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.300 
the timing and the final point is this
timing<00:05:52.720> is<00:05:52.900> then<00:05:53.410> because<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:54.010> all<00:05:54.130> these

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
timing is then because of all these

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.030 
timing is then because of all these
things<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:55.630> key<00:05:55.930> determining<00:05:56.590> factor<00:05:57.010> of

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
things the key determining factor of

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.640 
things the key determining factor of
your<00:05:57.400> level<00:05:57.850> why<00:05:58.570> is<00:05:58.630> a<00:05:58.780> beginner<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.260> beginner

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
your level why is a beginner a beginner

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.860 
your level why is a beginner a beginner
well<00:05:59.890> because<00:06:00.220> they<00:06:00.340> have<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.460> hard<00:06:00.760> time

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
well because they have a hard time

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.870 
well because they have a hard time
relating<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.560> ball<00:06:02.740> an<00:06:03.100> intermediate

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
relating to the ball an intermediate

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.340 
relating to the ball an intermediate
player<00:06:04.120> can<00:06:04.390> relate<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:04.750> little<00:06:05.050> bit<00:06:05.169> better

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
player can relate a little bit better

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.680 
player can relate a little bit better
and<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:06.010> pro<00:06:06.280> is<00:06:06.340> a<00:06:06.520> pro<00:06:06.789> because<00:06:07.270> they<00:06:07.479> can

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
and a pro is a pro because they can

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.630 
and a pro is a pro because they can
create<00:06:08.080> that<00:06:08.440> excellent<00:06:09.100> relationship

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
create that excellent relationship

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.550 
create that excellent relationship
between<00:06:09.789> them<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.479> ball<00:06:10.690> no<00:06:11.229> matter

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
between them and the ball no matter

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.710 
between them and the ball no matter
where<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:11.919> ball<00:06:12.070> is<00:06:12.130> and<00:06:12.730> make<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.450> great

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
where the ball is and make that great

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720 
where the ball is and make that great
timing<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.590> if<00:06:14.740> you<00:06:14.860> really<00:06:15.130> want<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.400> improve

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
timing so if you really want to improve

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.730 
timing so if you really want to improve
your<00:06:15.970> level<00:06:16.150> one<00:06:16.630> of<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.810> main<00:06:17.200> things<00:06:17.620> you

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
your level one of the main things you

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.620 
your level one of the main things you
need<00:06:17.800> to<00:06:18.040> work<00:06:18.190> on<00:06:18.340> is<00:06:18.520> your<00:06:18.550> timing<00:06:19.210> because

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
need to work on is your timing because

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.860 
need to work on is your timing because
timing<00:06:20.230> is<00:06:20.380> everything
