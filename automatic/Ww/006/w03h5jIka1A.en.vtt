something that is very easy to use to
check<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> codes<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:39.090> paperclip<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.910> have

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
check the codes is a paperclip you have

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
check the codes is a paperclip you have
a<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.510> B<00:00:42.540> ports<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:45.200> right<00:00:46.200> there

thing you want to do is as you can see

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.130 
thing you want to do is as you can see
the<00:01:26.000> service<00:01:26.390> engine<00:01:26.659> soon<00:01:26.689> light<00:01:26.930> flashing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.020 

as<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.190> there<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.550> just<00:01:32.760> flashed

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
as you can see there it just flashed

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.290 
as you can see there it just flashed
code<00:01:33.330> 12<00:01:33.720> letting<00:01:34.380> me<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.760> is<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
code 12 letting me know that it is in

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.930 
code 12 letting me know that it is in
diagnostic<00:01:37.260> codes<00:01:37.979> which<00:01:38.340> means<00:01:38.580> it'll<00:01:38.760> let

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
diagnostic codes which means it'll let

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.380 
diagnostic codes which means it'll let
me<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.330> if<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.590> code<00:01:41.270> generally<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
me know if there's a code generally this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
me know if there's a code generally this
will<00:01:42.600> blink<00:01:42.869> three<00:01:43.170> times<00:01:43.590> it'll<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.460> one

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
will blink three times it'll go one

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.150 
will blink three times it'll go one
short<00:01:45.030> pause<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.510> can<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
short pause as you can see here one and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.300 
short pause as you can see here one and
then<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.180> short<00:01:48.479> ones<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.900> two<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:50.009> code

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
then two short ones one two that's code

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.380 
then two short ones one two that's code
12<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.110> code<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:53.220> after<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
12 if you have a code right after this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.040 
12 if you have a code right after this
code<00:01:54.869> 12<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.409> blunt<00:01:55.800> blinked<00:01:56.340> three<00:01:56.700> times

email me or you can look it up online to

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.109 
email me or you can look it up online to
the<00:02:05.970> specific<00:02:06.420> code<00:02:06.660> say<00:02:07.050> it's<00:02:07.259> 24<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.100> 26<00:02:08.670> code

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the specific code say it's 24 or 26 code

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.170 
the specific code say it's 24 or 26 code
32<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.380> forth<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.120> see
