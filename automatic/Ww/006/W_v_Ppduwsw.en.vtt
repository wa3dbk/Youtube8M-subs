00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.960
 the GIS fingerprints like applications I have done graphically very nicely 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.519
 applications 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.280
 Dimi pretends to her from an intelligence agency or the police from Welda 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.150
 this app is made of her feces 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
 she helps me say goodbye to colleagues and friends 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.519
 the strong Serb was she had various functions poet use 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.380
 can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 I will 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 the fingerprint scanner Nahles 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 this is now loaded 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.490
 For example, with this one, I can say a colleague. Hey, you had that 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.010
 Fingers and then let's see if you can break their pace in a criminal file 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 based 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.300
 at first "We tech values ​​the whole thing worked for Next 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.300
 and started astonished 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.070
 the colleague is a gunner 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.260
 Hüfingen met Martins here 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.370
 so gentle with the SGE started addiction is looking for now 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 various databases of secret services and police 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.360
 we will find the corresponding picture 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 with the appropriate text 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 the cool thing about this application is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.619
 I came to set everything myself 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.180
 that means I started here 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.260
 So when I start Heinz Winkler I do not have an end here 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.280
 stud 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 and here I can now all agreed to choose Conny FOTA Finite offers 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 Words I can also be rank mim from the album 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.070
 a picture that made itself for example 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.410
 and I can say 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.950
 Just look at me 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 Time so time I just have what picture frames 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.180
 Photo AP with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.080
 take a picture that I have selected for example this and also here 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.780
 be unknown Random Text that's just called 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.400
 his against which text 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.310
 there is something of prostitution then middle of the bank robbery and so on 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.320
 continue 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.789
 but I was able to 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.789
 customize this copywriter and write something yourself 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 looked different 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.909
 that then, for example, to a colleague very well 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.359
 I can say in a black Mercedes 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.650
 it's like a black Mercedes fled bank robbery and so on 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 Please let us know 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.779
 I start the application now to measure 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 from the front 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.739
 how I do it 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.419
 What sounds like a paradox is more features like a special romp 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.769
 the dogs should wait so I can use it but unfortunately works 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 not quite Bavaria could live me are experienced how well the dog hears 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 I have a polygraph and I'll do the function 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.339
 I still have it here 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.499
 no metal detectors 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.539
 who is on the TGD 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.999
 not a real one was involved it is also about that colleagues 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:00.409
 can fool 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.799
 Water flows very well, this functionality does not work 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.889
 Wall 10 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.889
 I can use my iPhone as well as Osmann 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.449
 Colleague Soulmate nothing that I can take something now so 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.949
 a conversation with 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.330
 let someone hear without anyone noticing 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.780
 not quite genders 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.599
 split off and listen to later 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.679
 I also have 11 4 one 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.239
 The Most Wanted list invented known 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.669
 for reporting 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.189
 and the crime 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.509
 and me in front of him he said Cham read the lie detector 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.900
 because death is not fair because that's not right, of course 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.669
 work with such a device 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.109
 I can also go here 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.469
 to fool a colleague with it 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.899
 I say, for example, a colleague had to lift his finger here 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.609
 Team chicks thumbs up 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.250
 then ask the question is Todd Bush a song 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.099
 as soon as the ethics in question is 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.919
 I can then click on it 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.879
 I am and education needed now but two seemed to really want me 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
 to fall with all clothes 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.129
 I said Skibbe 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.499
 that's right 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.449
 so that means 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.459
 George Bush is a liar 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.530
 how it works that the device automatically detects if a WG is not 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.059
 there or not 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.809
 Percent is 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:24.720
 something you learn how to divert the cities 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.960
 I do not want to reveal the secret then I just cool you I can 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.400
 thus by colleagues 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.550
 Of course, at the beginning, important questions are questionable, of course, something they know or do 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.689
 rather, I know if it's true or false 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.830
 and then I can ask personal questions 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.159
 and then look Michi react to it 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.520
 so that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.479
 a Coles part with a lot of high fun factor 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.150
 That's it 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.490
 this app 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.800
 offers a lot of travel because it has many under five years 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.139
 which are very well done 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.580
 and as I already said Beijing 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.050
 the bright graphic MESZ acrylic or simply from the point of view of the graphics 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.059
 very nicely done I can say something just recommend
