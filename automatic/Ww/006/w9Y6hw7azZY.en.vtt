00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.749
 1 of 2002 to a new video video that I 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.430
 I think it's quite important that 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.779
 when we touch the next generation it's 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 the video becomes more important in the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.540
 paramenos a street you know how beautiful 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.559
 4s - presented and teams of 120 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.929
 run the same way inside very 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 little and basically in a meeting of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.289
 investors electronic then 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 have said enough quite a few things 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.609
 pretty pretty important things 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.429
 I am also here with goldman and morgan 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.010
 city and good basically said it the 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.269
 financial director of electronics has 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.480
 basically said they are very 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 prepared for the next generation 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 who are going to be the most prepared and talgo 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.370
 have spoken to us about buying power not 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 He has said quite a lot of things 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 a little they basically say they're going to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.010
 be the most win and all this type 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:52.140
 of things from investors that companies 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.220
 let's say that's not to say good 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.440
 basically has said data very 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.660
 important as that basically the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 next generation will be between 8 and 10 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 times more powerful than the current one with what 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.400
 which is how we are going to see great games very 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.340
 good we're going to have graphics 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.350
 of very high definition and really not 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 for less it does not seem that the next 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.190
 generation will waste a lot of power 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.750
 will invest basically less and in 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.010
 they are very close to the fish in the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.630
 fish has also said this sir that 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.240
 basically, what they used to take 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.550
 months to do now will be days put 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 that everything is very close to the fish and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.330
 really, you do not have to do those 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.790
 ports is badly done if that and power things 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.340
 that then they stay very bad or have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.040
 much more to be done not basically 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.230
 They have also said that good what 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.590
 in e3 many things are taught and 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.600
 Even before the e3 can teach more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.010
 new things with which it is good that the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.810
 220 has to be submitted before e3 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.910
 since they are going to present games 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.260
 Well, they have to try to 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.800
 those trailers for already appear the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.810
 symbol of equipment 720 below and is the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.430
 that he took out the trailer put the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 platforms from which it is going to take and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.110
 I suppose that xbox to microsoft suits you 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.450
 since the console is presented and that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.250
 come out those names not to say it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.020
 somehow they also have 15 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 titles to submit in total for the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.780
 next generation which are a lot 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.920
 of titles that we will see see what they are 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.230
 surely from the fifa 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.850
 battlefield 4 the game quite games 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.470
 of sport will surely be reduced 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.970
 quite the list of those 15 that of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.560
 important games I did not see surely by 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.900
 one hundred were five that maybe not 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.850
 let's know that they are healthy and not eight 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400
 we could say and not if I forget 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.970
 something else on days 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.590
 also the theme of 1080p 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.720
 60 to 600 and say 60 frames available 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.329
 present in whatever title they go 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.769
 to thank thanks to break the 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.939
 limitations that they had with the previous 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.099
 generation in the current one in which 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.379
 we are now in the next one because it's going to 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.879
 be possible all this I think that what 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.220
 others that you have commented is all well 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.140
 Angel conscious and basically not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.750
 it's going to cost a lot more to develop between 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.239
 yes 4x boxes have been talked about even a 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.359
 increase of 5 or 10 percent not of 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.790
 of development money increase with 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.190
 which then are not something so high not that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.510
 that and also counting what will be done 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.700
 things faster than before 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.069
 we could have good games in a 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.560
 development of two years or so having 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.000
 a pretty acceptable title not in that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.950
 do not meditate so much to develop as 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.599
 before is the example are four programs 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.739
 easy to develop which company are 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.989
 three companies are three since it was very 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.870
 difficult and equipment is to squeeze the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.389
 power much sooner not so 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.859
 good we will see the one that has prepared us 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.540
 electronic arts for the next months 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.940
 we will see to see that so longed for 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.919
 butterfield 4 is volvo inside no 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.540
 a lot and nothing we see in the next 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.219
 video will be Russian male 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.219
 the gas is released
