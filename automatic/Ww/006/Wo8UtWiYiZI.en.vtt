 Chapter 2 Marilyn Monroe and N°5 Perfume 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.100
 "What do you wear when you sleep?" 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.040
 "Only a few drops of N°5..." 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 Maybe she was asked when she got off the plane? 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.150
 Maybe at a press conference? 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.120
 We may not know when she first said this sentence. 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.200
 April 7, 1952 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.110
 Marilyn Monroe 26 years old 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.200
 For the first time, she became the cover of Life magazine. 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.100
 For the first time, her famous saying about N°5 was made public. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 Her legend with N°5 was born. 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.170
 October 1953 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.120
 882 North Doheny Avenue, Beverly Hills 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.000
 Taking photos for Modern Screen 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110
 Marilyn Monroe is lying on her bed...not a glimpse 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 In each photo, there is a bottle of N°5 on her bedside 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.160
 These photos have never been published before. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.120
 April 1960 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.220
 Reporter George Belmont is the French magazine "Jia Ren" 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.060
 Interview with Marilyn Monroe 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.200
 At the time, she was filming the film "Let's Love", directed by George Cook, Yves Mondang. 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 Naturally, she talked about N°5 again. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.180
 This recording has never been published before. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.200
 October 2012 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.150
 Chanel got the recording of this interview. 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 the first time 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210
 We heard Marilyn Monroe personally talk about the legendary story about "a few drops of N°5" 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.130
 You know, people will ask me some questions. 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.130
 For example 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 "What do you wear when you sleep?" 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.100
 "Wear pajamas? Wear a nightdress?" 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.000
 "I still wear a nightgown?" 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.090
 So I replied: Chanel N°5 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.110
 Because this is the truth! 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.140
 I don't want to say "nothing" 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.130
 But... this is indeed the truth 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.130
 Marilyn Monroe and N°5, the legend of forever
