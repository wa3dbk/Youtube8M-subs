00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.910
 guys this boxing is a little late 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.589
 on the table of outputs 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.990
 as you know what by now from the early of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 November, which came out, however , has it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.880
 received only now because of the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 story I told for those who do 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.600
 were lost and the suite's suite that a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220
 following the promotion of the t vision 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.859
 they give 500 copies of cod 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 and I certainly so for 24 what 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.320
 I have to show you by means of that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 exactly the text of it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 derivative I refer you to the video if you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.010
 interested or indeed had mine 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 copy of ghost I first shot instead 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 that of a brother is still closed 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.760
 in short, excellent for 100 and 200 euros 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.800
 so stuff for two for free 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 in short, I always like it even if the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.340
 context from which they come 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.870
 he is not the happiest also because with the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.640
 project should be given as a gift 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.790
 however I would not have taken ropes but 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 most certainly not even the prestige 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.960
 let alone just then ever 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.369
 certainly glad he arrived now 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.500
 even if we go further it was not a 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 problem I'm quite happy because 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 it had to arrive within six months 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.200
 from what is written in the release 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.360
 when I signed up anyway I was 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.740
 resigned to receive their own but they are 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.600
 in April 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.509
 but not even twenty days later 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 almost at the exit, or at least months 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 taking this morning at 10 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.829
 so courier on those packages really 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 activision worked as a textbook 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.649
 this time it was absolutely not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.850
 Merit intervenes and what about the game 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 sum i now call of duty is always more 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.799
 focusing on the stories that online 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.140
 before it characterized the series during 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.450
 gradually diminishing more and more 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.210
 4-hour online campaign 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.320
 so there and online allows a game not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.660
 that's it 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.580
 and therefore I am already for what it is a 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.830
 reason not to take it despite me 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.250
 games the series from the first shorts came out 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 on computer at the time now 21 12 years 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.860
 it does more or less eleven years ago so it goes 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.290
 well i 'm pretty happy i have to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.400
 be honest because they are the edition of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 gender is much less exaggerated than 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.180
 to other prestige 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 remember it is much more expensive because it was 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.510
 dearest all the other animals in Rome 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.330
 200 euros 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.130
 the prestige that the other premiums 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.800
 yes to 3 and timely, however, everywhere 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.710
 content maybe the best because you know 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.630
 flying drone made of polystyrene book 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.060
 is on night was the rcx charge of 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.060
 a bullshit instead a hundred one 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.320
 full hd camera that aimed at 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.960
 attack alarms from soft air 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.780
 wanting and finally there is really the 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.510
 something that I said was sensible since 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.690
 when they announced the first premium of 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.700
 modern warfare 2 cancel pass there is one of 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.280
 out there 200 euros of Rome 150 euros of 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.130
 stuff for the passes with all the dlc to this one 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.720
 consent regardless of contained regattas 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.780
 and break 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.280
 and I pay a lady, however, immediately inside 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 the pass for all illegal transactions 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.590
 this makes sense that I am short from 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.870
 part all was collector found 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.160
 quite sensible for my taste 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.590
 even though he hadn't bought it for the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.220
 reasons I said so I am 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.640
 rather satisfied I say sedition 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.380
 thank you so less then go then and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 now pass we realize what they do 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.150
 it's inside 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.390
 ok guys reappropriate momentarily 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.720
 the original place for the unboxing 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.720
 state 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.020
 plastic, let's say inside practically 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.610
 there is the cordura bracelet that looks like 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.040
 really nice the steel box the viewfinder 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.520
 1080p camera the season pass and the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.350
 freefall map with bonus is more a series 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.020
 of digital content for per 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.590
 multiplayer and soundtrack 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.890
 downloadable then packaging is 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.750
 really makes it very simple 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:40.660
 elegant here the logo in relief and inside 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:48.430
 It presents itself in this manner to 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:56.130
 compartments with the box that makes 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.130
 pretty nice really ok two discs 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:09.950
 I did son pass the map what else 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.350
 just passive has rightly manual 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.850
 This masterpiece's instructions can be lost 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.440
 then there is this 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:31.370
 here is the bracelet a beautiful package 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.370
 if we can make a mess 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.140
 the woman 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.140
 here it is the really bracelet 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:57.510
 beautiful like that material 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:06:00.660
 I believe that a life closes pretty much 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.930
 fuck according to me but it's the impressions 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.320
 and a little inconvenient to carry because 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:12.750
 really really hard here but oh well 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.210
 nice however ok but the highlight 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.650
 obviously in here what the fuck that 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:24.419
 if it was a little bigger if 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:29.190
 I have to be honest but after anna cazzola 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:31.200
 but the miniature god is a lot 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.020
 professional as a kit and you see that is yes 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.900
 opens up to all of all the various 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.900
 hooks to mount it up on various things 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:48.660
 here is a 2GB memory with a microsd 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:52.340
 to record what substitutions are 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:56.240
 that you can the smallest next time 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.240
 Lilliputian fragments 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:04.830
 and therefore we would have cable to connect it to 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:14.840
 all in this little born glue 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:14.840
 this ok here this goal is there 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.960
 I don't really know what to think 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.590
 I should try it to say I thought 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.300
 it was a bigger and more sincere hair 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.000
 let's say that here without having tried it if 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.500
 I had taken 200 euros between this and 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.780
 in short, he would n't do so well 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:46.800
 maybe this is the protection with time 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:49.320
 logo ok then really all for this 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.940
 edition that I repeat I don't really know 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.160
 as we hope because I don't know how 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.530
 that camera works 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.880
 view like this seems like bullshit 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.230
 sincerely, however, maybe you have understood the 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.240
 I'll try 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.190
 so for now I thank you yes 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.750
 had a short time for unboxing 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.200
 breast when it arrives 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.200
 Hi everyone
