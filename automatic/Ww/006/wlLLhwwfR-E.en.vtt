00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 finish 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.919
 the reality we hide 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.149
 we hit we crash into reality against space and time 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.140
 in the consistent spending really 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.160
 because the history of that sense is illusion and dreams well 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 that there really is a concept of hotel the area 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.810
 what we really are are something else sometimes the concepts 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.520
 what they say but that we do those concepts well 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.920
 personalized 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 - that honor and legality 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.290
 do not 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.170
 nor in their homes very easy 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.369
 the block the movements of the artist how I'm sorry because that's very 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.200
 important 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 I do not think he won to face denied today to ea and it in a combo he will come to do 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 a painting later I think he faces directly with him and the 2010 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.610
 and in the gestures of the movements that the sec 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.040
 pedro to achieve it is a task but also to do nothing this reform nor 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.950
 even surrender 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 kind of ritual 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.200
 to talk a little more in the engadget technology to the street 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 make up has to say b 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.060
 he missed he has taken many things 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 Germanic schoolboy who pushed me another with violin 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.970
 from co2 night express yourself with a lot of spontaneity 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.830
 at the time of doing I think he 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 you do not have to do it anymore daily intervention 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.469
 is that when I feel better is with you 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.629
 painting quintero that is trying the act of painting 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.439
 I'm not getting into the shop right away 8 and 10 hours or up to 14 16 hours 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.290
 but the 16 hours the tremors in hand the moment even more 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.760
 nec that I love the most is when when this one like in that limbo 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.889
 between reality and imagination 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.659
 if I let myself go 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.659
 for those colors and for those roads that are 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.279
 announcing that they are not well 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.909
 calling by means of painting 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 in 13 other seats are very few 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.859
 I think eight o'clock suddenly thinks or not a nick or seconds 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.689
 that those are the most spectacular video according to many residents 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.669
 wonderful lessons 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.049
 the idea is that that soil like 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.839
 like life itself or common like a river 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.109
 that they know that it is not the same river, the nights that it is not the 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.879
 same day and the same night 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.919
 even if they are 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.989
 the day goes the night it comes and again it comes back and so 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.299
 they were all surrounded by smoke with the teenager society 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.809
 about the idea is that for now just something in something different and an omv 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.809
 adventure a landfill 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 c 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:46.729
 coates the striped occasions to the jungle 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.699
 the jungle the president 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.829
 by the hand of my clothes and biomass 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.049
 because I'm in a field there 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.450
 Then when I came here, the university suddenly I wanted to be a 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.859
 artist 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.149
 as 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:04.709
 as the dea in the history of western art believes to have it like them 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.839
 but then I realized that I had to make some personal contribution and so 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.709
 it was that I went back to the jungle 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.879
 the jungle inside the jungle of my memory 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.870
 physically and visiting the jungle 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.189
 when I saw the jungle with other eyes 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.629
 I was very surprised 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.509
 It was that she who 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.710
 practically like I admitted the spark for what and the motivation 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.249
 why did you understand what I want to communicate 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.669
 and I think we have the 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.629
 in the putumayo part of the lung of the world 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.059
 and that lung is common oxygen 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.059
 that you will see this and you have to tell these gentlemen 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.039
 to these gentlemen who are importing the world and the batches 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.270
 is associating with waste itself 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.360
 industrial and toxic waste 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.900
 tell him this because of what we have here 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.120
 and then for me the jungle 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.909
 must be presented as close to the rebellion 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.900
 the closest to the wild that is wonderful 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.900
 and the closest thing to life 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.689
 trial is a 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.469
 very interesting experience of a lot of content sent 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.669
 I live where thousands of parishioners because my culture 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.699
 can be 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.090
 they allowed me and it is that in their opinion they deserve the work that 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.930
 they should 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.509
 in clean the father was 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.900
 the lovers and I lived around the whole cd 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.270
 the stability pact 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.080
 linked to nature and plants and the journey 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.460
 I rather try to recreate is to understand with respect 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.009
 the departure of the visions of Friday 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.680
 the eyes of the world bean the other cultures that are still intact 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.819
 environment or sectors very well 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.300
 international 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.379
 min 9 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.960
 they were very spontaneous and then that way 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.059
 what I perceive is what he 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.669
 the routes he measured as a spirit of the painter as a soul in pain 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.629
 ln and what I do is directly save the painting
