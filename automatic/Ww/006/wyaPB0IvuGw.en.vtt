up to date with all the new features
we're<00:00:25.119> talking<00:00:25.509> about<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:26.050> no<00:00:26.140> tative<00:00:27.099> objects

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
we're talking about a no tative objects

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.330 
we're talking about a no tative objects
and<00:00:27.939> annotation<00:00:28.840> which<00:00:28.869> is<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.230> really<00:00:29.680> nice

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
and annotation which is a really nice

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.410 
and annotation which is a really nice
new<00:00:30.759> feature<00:00:30.789> that<00:00:31.270> we<00:00:31.750> we<00:00:32.320> appreciate<00:00:32.890> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
new feature that we we appreciate and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.470 
new feature that we we appreciate and
with<00:00:34.420> it<00:00:34.750> we<00:00:35.199> can<00:00:35.230> use<00:00:35.610> paper<00:00:36.610> space<00:00:37.030> as<00:00:37.300> well

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
with it we can use paper space as well

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.210 
with it we can use paper space as well
to<00:00:37.750> further<00:00:37.989> enhance<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.710> we've<00:00:38.890> had<00:00:39.070> all

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
to further enhance it we've had all

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.280 
to further enhance it we've had all
kinds<00:00:39.550> of<00:00:39.610> Lisp<00:00:39.910> routines<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.660> fancy<00:00:41.140> little

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
kinds of Lisp routines and fancy little

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.040 
kinds of Lisp routines and fancy little
macros<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:42.100> do<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> lot<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.670> what<00:00:43.360> has<00:00:43.540> now<00:00:43.750> been

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
macros to do a lot of what has now been

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.079 
macros to do a lot of what has now been
fixed<00:00:44.350> with<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.860> finally<00:00:45.370> with<00:00:45.879> this

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
fixed with the finally with this

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.140 
fixed with the finally with this
annotation<00:00:46.750> scale<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:48.010> paper<00:00:48.519> space<00:00:48.670> it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
annotation scale so in paper space it

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.939 
annotation scale so in paper space it
takes<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.690> step<00:00:49.989> further<00:00:50.230> if<00:00:50.530> we<00:00:50.649> go<00:00:50.800> into

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
takes it to a step further if we go into

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.799 
takes it to a step further if we go into
our<00:00:51.100> paper<00:00:51.430> space<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.090> if<00:00:52.149> we<00:00:52.270> can't<00:00:52.539> see

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.660 
here we have to view ports if I click on
a<00:01:06.759> viewport<00:01:07.300> now<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:08.259> will<00:01:08.410> see<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.920> first<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
a viewport now we will see that first of

a viewport now we will see that first of
all<00:01:09.789> we<00:01:10.000> can<00:01:10.140> unlock<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.200> viewport<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.070> way

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
all we can unlock the viewport that way

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.480 
all we can unlock the viewport that way
you<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:12.820> can't<00:01:13.060> go<00:01:13.960> inside<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.679> zoom

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
you know we can't go inside and zoom

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.210 
you know we can't go inside and zoom
with<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.940> that's<00:01:16.179> one<00:01:16.479> new<00:01:17.080> feature<00:01:17.289> there<00:01:17.679> but

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
with it that's one new feature there but

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.330 
with it that's one new feature there but
that's<00:01:18.520> not<00:01:19.240> related<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:19.990> scale<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.830> now

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that's not related to the scale and now

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.910 
that's not related to the scale and now
we<00:01:21.399> have<00:01:21.520> viewport<00:01:22.330> scale<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:22.929> either<00:01:23.170> from

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
we have viewport scale so either from

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710 
we have viewport scale so either from
within<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.759> viewport<00:01:25.360> okay<00:01:26.020> or<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:28.119> outside

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
within the viewport okay or from outside

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.809 
within the viewport okay or from outside
the<00:01:28.990> viewport<00:01:29.500> if<00:01:29.679> you<00:01:29.920> click<00:01:30.099> the<00:01:30.399> view<00:01:30.610> port

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
the viewport if you click the view port

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.660 
the viewport if you click the view port
you<00:01:31.030> can<00:01:31.060> set<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.599> viewport<00:01:32.050> scale<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:33.399> zoom

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
you can set the viewport scale the zoom

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.969 
you can set the viewport scale the zoom
scale<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.390> be<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:35.200> know<00:01:35.319> whatever<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.709> want

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
scale to be you know whatever you want

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.190 
scale to be you know whatever you want
say<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> quarter<00:01:36.849> inch<00:01:37.060> no<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.720> didn't<00:01:38.050> move

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
say a quarter inch no that didn't move

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.919 
say a quarter inch no that didn't move
let's<00:01:38.440> try<00:01:38.709> something<00:01:38.979> else<00:01:39.160> let's<00:01:40.000> go<00:01:40.149> 316

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
let's try something else let's go 316

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.320 
let's try something else let's go 316
okay<00:01:41.739> now<00:01:42.130> you'll<00:01:42.369> see<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.700> annotation

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
okay now you'll see the annotation

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.630 
okay now you'll see the annotation
update<00:01:43.810> one-eighth<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.560> an<00:01:44.709> inch<00:01:44.860> all<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.580> a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
update one-eighth of an inch all of a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.510 
update one-eighth of an inch all of a
sudden<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.060> annotation<00:01:46.720> comes<00:01:46.929> back<00:01:47.280> 3<00:01:48.280> 30

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
sudden the annotation comes back 3 30

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.900 
sudden the annotation comes back 3 30
seconds<00:01:49.149> annotation<00:01:50.020> disappears<00:01:50.590> again

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
seconds annotation disappears again

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.969 
seconds annotation disappears again
sixteenth<00:01:51.910> of<00:01:52.060> an<00:01:52.209> inch<00:01:52.360> annotation<00:01:53.289> comes

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
sixteenth of an inch annotation comes

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
sixteenth of an inch annotation comes
back<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.670> those<00:01:55.209> annotations<00:01:56.550> okay<00:01:57.550> are

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
back so those annotations okay are

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.499 
back so those annotations okay are
associated<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.950> different<00:02:00.310> scales<00:02:00.670> okay

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
associated to the different scales okay

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.960 
associated to the different scales okay
so<00:02:01.959> i<00:02:01.989> can<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.410> that<00:02:02.440> from<00:02:03.009> clicking<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:03.819> the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
so i can do that from clicking on the

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.690 
so i can do that from clicking on the
view<00:02:04.149> port<00:02:04.390> or<00:02:04.660> i<00:02:04.690> can<00:02:05.289> go<00:02:05.649> into<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.190> viewport

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
view port or i can go into the viewport

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.520 
view port or i can go into the viewport
and<00:02:06.849> set<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.330> back<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.750> be<00:02:07.899> one<00:02:08.080> eighth<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.410> an

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
and set it back to be one eighth of an

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.589 
and set it back to be one eighth of an
inch<00:02:08.619> equals<00:02:08.979> one<00:02:09.280> foot<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:10.030> always<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.360> good

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
inch equals one foot it's always a good

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.110 
inch equals one foot it's always a good
idea<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:11.080> position<00:02:11.830> yourself<00:02:12.280> centered<00:02:12.700> on

scale<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.400> annotations<00:02:22.209> follow

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
scale and then the annotations follow

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.970 
scale and then the annotations follow
the<00:02:22.810> rules<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.230> explained<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> previous

click both and they vary and I can turn

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.679 
click both and they vary and I can turn

around and set both of these to the same

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.339

scale<00:02:50.459> annotation<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.930> viewport<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.049> then

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
scale annotation and viewport and then

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.789 
scale annotation and viewport and then
it'll<00:02:53.739> update<00:02:54.099> okay<00:02:54.939> sometimes<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.650> will

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
it'll update okay sometimes you you will

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.920 
it'll update okay sometimes you you will
find<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> annotations<00:02:58.000> don't<00:02:58.269> update<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
find the annotations don't update the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.050 
find the annotations don't update the
way<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.109> want<00:02:59.439> and<00:02:59.590> what<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.010> find<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.700> result

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
way you want and what I find the result

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780 
way you want and what I find the result
is<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.420> try<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> regen<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.859> regen<00:03:03.310> all<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.669> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
is I try a regen in a regen all in the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.729 
is I try a regen in a regen all in the
easiest<00:03:04.209> way<00:03:04.329> sometimes<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.139> go<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.439> here

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
easiest way sometimes is to go in here

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.199 
easiest way sometimes is to go in here
and<00:03:05.829> re<00:03:06.549> select<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:08.430> scale<00:03:09.430> factors<00:03:09.970> for

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
and re select your scale factors for

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.270 
and re select your scale factors for
your<00:03:10.419> viewport<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.139> your<00:03:11.379> annotation<00:03:12.129> and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
your viewport and your annotation and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.500 
your viewport and your annotation and
then<00:03:12.430> all<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.730> sudden<00:03:12.760> you'll<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:13.389> it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
then all of a sudden you'll see it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.800 
then all of a sudden you'll see it
adjust<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.470> sometimes<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.219> regen<00:03:15.760> doesn't<00:03:16.629> work

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
adjust so sometimes a regen doesn't work

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.629 
adjust so sometimes a regen doesn't work
in<00:03:17.019> if<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.260> if<00:03:17.439> your<00:03:17.650> dimensions<00:03:18.250> or<00:03:18.459> your

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
in if you if your dimensions or your

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.580 
in if you if your dimensions or your
annotations<00:03:19.359> are<00:03:19.510> kind<00:03:19.719> of<00:03:19.780> going<00:03:19.930> wonky<00:03:20.319> on

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
annotations are kind of going wonky on

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.110 
annotations are kind of going wonky on
you<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.010> they're<00:03:21.099> not<00:03:21.219> behaving<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:21.939> way<00:03:21.969> you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
you and they're not behaving the way you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.569 
you and they're not behaving the way you
expect<00:03:22.659> sometimes<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:24.010> matter<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.310> going

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
expect sometimes it's a matter of going

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.959 
expect sometimes it's a matter of going
back<00:03:24.969> into<00:03:25.269> here<00:03:25.659> and<00:03:25.859> resetting<00:03:26.859> your

back into here and resetting your

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.259 
back into here and resetting your
annotation<00:03:27.969> and<00:03:28.150> your<00:03:28.989> viewport<00:03:29.530> scale<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:31.090> be

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
annotation and your viewport scale to be

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.140 
annotation and your viewport scale to be
this<00:03:31.450> way<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:35.530> all<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.919> also<00:03:36.519> notice<00:03:37.120> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
this way and I all we also notice that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.300 
this way and I all we also notice that
when<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.720> change<00:03:38.079> your<00:03:38.290> annotation<00:03:38.979> scale

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
when you change your annotation scale

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.250 
when you change your annotation scale
here<00:03:39.609> in<00:03:39.639> fact<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.150> changes<00:03:40.569> your<00:03:40.720> viewport

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
here in fact it changes your viewport

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.039 
here in fact it changes your viewport
scale<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.799> same<00:03:42.099> time<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.120> go<00:03:43.299> into<00:03:43.540> here

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
scale at the same time if I go into here

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.520 
scale at the same time if I go into here
and<00:03:44.229> I<00:03:45.099> let's<00:03:45.849> double-click<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.720> click<00:03:47.019> on<00:03:47.199> here

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
and I let's double-click I click on here

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.920 
and I let's double-click I click on here
and<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.799> go<00:03:47.979> to<00:03:48.040> annotation<00:03:48.970> scale<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.689> set

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
and I go to annotation scale and I set

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
and I go to annotation scale and I set
this<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.290> be<00:03:50.439> an<00:03:50.530> eighth<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.859> an<00:03:51.010> inch<00:03:51.129> it<00:03:51.519> seems

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
this to be an eighth of an inch it seems

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.110 
this to be an eighth of an inch it seems
it<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.659> also<00:03:53.049> sets<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.680> viewport<00:03:54.669> scale<00:03:54.939> at

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
it and also sets the viewport scale at

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.979 
it and also sets the viewport scale at
the<00:03:55.180> same<00:03:55.479> time<00:03:56.099> okay<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:57.790> that's<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.810> nice

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
the same time okay so that's a nice

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.780 
the same time okay so that's a nice
feature<00:03:59.229> so<00:03:59.709> again<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.220> can<00:04:00.400> have<00:04:00.549> them

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
feature so again we can have them

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.110 
feature so again we can have them
different<00:04:01.239> ok<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:01.979> this<00:04:02.979> viewport<00:04:03.579> can<00:04:03.909> have

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
different ok so this viewport can have

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.110 
different ok so this viewport can have
one<00:04:04.409> viewport<00:04:05.409> scale<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.069> annotation<00:04:06.819> scale

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
one viewport scale and annotation scale

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.339 
one viewport scale and annotation scale
you<00:04:07.329> can<00:04:07.359> vary<00:04:07.810> them<00:04:08.079> ok<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.009> can<00:04:09.430> have<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.819> the

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
you can vary them ok I can have the the

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.619 
you can vary them ok I can have the the
viewport<00:04:11.349> scale<00:04:11.650> independently<00:04:12.639> of<00:04:12.879> the

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
viewport scale independently of the

lock<00:04:19.539> these<00:04:19.840> two<00:04:20.139> objects<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.829> haven't<00:04:21.159> found

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
lock these two objects I haven't found

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.450 
lock these two objects I haven't found
that<00:04:21.489> yet<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:22.380> I'm<00:04:23.380> sure<00:04:23.650> that's<00:04:23.919> what<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.310> is

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that yet so I'm sure that's what that is

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.040 
that yet so I'm sure that's what that is
so<00:04:24.610> these<00:04:24.759> two<00:04:24.970> are<00:04:25.000> talking<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.720> each<00:04:25.870> other

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
so these two are talking to each other

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.290 
so these two are talking to each other
and<00:04:26.320> then<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:27.099> there<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.090> matter

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
and then from there on in it's a matter

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.870 
and then from there on in it's a matter
of<00:04:28.449> each<00:04:28.840> individual<00:04:29.500> object<00:04:30.099> when<00:04:30.669> we

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
of each individual object when we

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580 
of each individual object when we
right-click<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.630> we<00:04:31.750> go<00:04:31.900> down<00:04:32.139> into<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
right-click and we go down into the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.089 
right-click and we go down into the
annotated<00:04:33.930> management<00:04:34.930> which<00:04:35.710> scales

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
annotated management which scales

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.420 
annotated management which scales
they've<00:04:36.490> been<00:04:36.699> set<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.180> use<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:38.159> they're<00:04:39.159> from

they've been set to use and they're from
there<00:04:39.669> it's<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.210> matter<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.570> using<00:04:40.870> these

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
there it's a matter of using these

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.950 
there it's a matter of using these
