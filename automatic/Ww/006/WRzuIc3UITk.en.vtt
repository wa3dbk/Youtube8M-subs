00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 friends of intermediate tv like this in me 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.340
 I'm Luis Gg and good for all those 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.589
 that they love the music that they are 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 music lovers and especially those who 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.390
 who are traveling back and forth to them 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.510
 We want to present the new line of 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.190
 logitech audio equipment which 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.450
 they work with a brand that they 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.059
 acquired some years ago it is called 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.920
 ultimate ears and the truth is that we see 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.079
 I made a very good purchase because 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.390
 because the technology behind the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.219
 ultimate ears speakers let's say give 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.170
 some facilities 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.670
 interesting for all those who we 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.119
 love music for example here is 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.460
 the ultimate ears boom is a horn that 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.009
 the truth is very interesting because 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.929
 offers a sound in 360 degrees ie 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.690
 you do not have to adjust in any position 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.420
 and maybe what I love about this 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.090
 speaker is that you can pair it via 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.340
 bluetooth with other speakers and use 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.560
 via stereo this way 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.179
 you only have the power of one 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.369
 but two in one configuration 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.740
 outside because we have it the youngest son 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.420
 mini boom that is very similar but good 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.280
 with a lot more audio power 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.700
 small and in the case already of the brand 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.770
 logitech la x100 a portable speaker that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.179
 you can put it on the table and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.490
 It can also be useful for you 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.229
 answer calls the time the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.539
 accessible products start from there 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.549
 12 of the 3000 pesos in the case of 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.380
 album but good in the case of the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.799
 x100 you can find it out there 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.179
 the 700 but 699 so they do not correct me 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.590
 because the truth is that they are products 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.239
 that are worth it that they are already in the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.429
 Mexican market and you can 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.530
 find in different outlets 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.060
 we are going to try them and especially 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.890
 let's say what we like to say the most 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.780
 who is your father this afternoon and how 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.429
 you can use I am elvis kg we are 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.429
 here in intermediate tv we continue
