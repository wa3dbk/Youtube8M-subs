00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
processor then off to the side I have a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
processor then off to the side I have a
half<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> cup<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.170> canola<00:01:04.589> oil<00:01:04.770> that<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.460> going

yolks<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> Dijon<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.170> I'm<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.470> get

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
yolks and the Dijon so I'm going to get

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.060 
yolks and the Dijon so I'm going to get
the<00:01:10.800> food<00:01:11.280> processor<00:01:11.790> started<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:14.009> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the food processor started I'm going to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
the food processor started I'm going to
let<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.640> nice<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.910> creamy<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.920> just

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
let that get nice and creamy so I'm just

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
let that get nice and creamy so I'm just
going<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.220> start<00:01:17.490> beating<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> eggs<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going to start beating the eggs and it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to start beating the eggs and it's
beating<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> eggs<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.800> blending<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
beating the eggs and blending the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
beating the eggs and blending the
mustard<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.210> basically<00:01:21.540> making<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
mustard and it's basically making this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.430 
mustard and it's basically making this
paste<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:23.910> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> let<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.300> go<00:01:24.690> let

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
paste so I'm going to let that go let

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.730 
paste so I'm going to let that go let
the<00:01:25.619> eggs<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.950> nice<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.220> beat<00:01:27.380> once<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> eggs

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the eggs get nice and beat once the eggs

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
the eggs get nice and beat once the eggs
take<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> thick<00:01:29.790> creamy<00:01:30.150> texture<00:01:30.630> I'm

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
take on this thick creamy texture I'm

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
take on this thick creamy texture I'm
going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.410> slowly<00:01:31.710> start<00:01:31.890> adding<00:01:32.340> 1/2<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.360> cup

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
going to slowly start adding 1/2 a cup

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.060 
going to slowly start adding 1/2 a cup
of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.990> oil

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.490 

the<00:01:39.550> reason<00:01:39.880> why<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.060> added<00:01:40.420> very<00:01:40.720> slowly<00:01:41.200> like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
the reason why I added very slowly like

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.770 
the reason why I added very slowly like
this<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.860> because<00:01:42.190> I<00:01:42.220> want<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.760> eggs<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.420> take

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
this is because I want the eggs to take

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.350 
this is because I want the eggs to take
on<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.230> oil<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.190> don't<00:01:45.370> want<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.820> become<00:01:45.910> two

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
on the oil I don't want it to become two

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.630 
on the oil I don't want it to become two
separate<00:01:46.840> entities<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.380> rather<00:01:47.560> blend<00:01:48.460> into

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
separate entities but rather blend into

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.380 
separate entities but rather blend into
one<00:01:48.970> entity<00:01:49.180> which<00:01:49.990> will<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.440> mayonnaise

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.360 

once<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.570> finish<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.560> see<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.190> eggs

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
once I finish you can see that the eggs

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.650 
once I finish you can see that the eggs
and<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.730> mayonnaise<00:01:57.910> have<00:01:58.270> blend<00:01:58.510> together

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
and the mayonnaise have blend together

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.680 
and the mayonnaise have blend together
to<00:01:58.960> create<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.560> uniform<00:02:00.460> substance<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
to create a uniform substance this is

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630 
to create a uniform substance this is
the<00:02:01.840> actually<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> overall<00:02:02.500> mayonnaise<00:02:03.130> now

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
you can try it to see if it needs

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.900 
you can try it to see if it needs
anything<00:02:05.530> else<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.980> lot<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.310> times<00:02:06.490> people<00:02:06.820> like

juice<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.230> lemon<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.800> give<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
juice of the lemon to just give it a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.520 
juice of the lemon to just give it a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
little bit of a lemon a little bit of a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.660 
little bit of a lemon a little bit of a
lemon<00:02:23.710> zest<00:02:25.890> blend<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.010> adjust<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> tab

lemon zest blend it adjust the tab

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.610

longer<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> takes<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.080> lemon<00:02:29.350> flavor

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
longer so it takes on the lemon flavor

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.740 
longer so it takes on the lemon flavor
but<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.580> don't<00:02:30.760> want<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.970> blend<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.330> too<00:02:31.540> long

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
but you don't want to blend it too long

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.330 
but you don't want to blend it too long
because<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.260> over<00:02:32.620> blend<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
because if you over blend it then the
