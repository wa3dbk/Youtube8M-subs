 our next days will come out 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.630
 but in the meantime we concentrate because 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.830
 still missing on the cleats and there is 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.070
 still the possibility of doing something 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.080
 of how much less we hope that 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.640
 this possibility becomes a reality 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.580

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.990
 the less it does nothing and in any case xbox 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.800
 we could make legends but look at her 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.960
 what a legend I am not and so boh then 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.770
 maybe she's the same but we'll never find them 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.460
 or maybe they owed your package who knows 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.690

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.830
 there seems to be a chemistry style 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.960
 we also see it may have been done 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.220
