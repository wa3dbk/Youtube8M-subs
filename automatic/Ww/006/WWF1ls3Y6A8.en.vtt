amazing season it's kind of one of the
ones<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.830> don't<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.670> he's<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
ones that I don't think he's going to be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.410 
ones that I don't think he's going to be
rare<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.580> loads<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> rare

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
rare as I think they have loads of rare

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.760 
rare as I think they have loads of rare
players<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.900> Chelsea<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.500> honest

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
players and Chelsea and to be honest

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.060 
players and Chelsea and to be honest
having<00:01:29.400> another<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
having another one there would be just I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.289 
having another one there would be just I
just<00:01:32.100> don't<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> rare

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
just don't think you're going to rare

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
just don't think you're going to rare
yeah<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.630> maybe<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.890> he<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.430> another

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
yeah i think maybe one if he had another

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.609 
yeah i think maybe one if he had another
good<00:01:35.820> season<00:01:36.030> i<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.600> will<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.900> rare<00:01:37.140> but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
good season i think he will go rare but

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
good season i think he will go rare but
at<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> minute<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.640> non<00:01:38.850> rare<00:01:39.090> 81<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
at the minute I think non rare 81 is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
at the minute I think non rare 81 is
definitely<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.380> apparently<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> very

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
definitely good apparently is a very

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.870 
definitely good apparently is a very
very<00:01:42.180> solid<00:01:42.750> defender<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
very solid defender to have in in

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.139 
very solid defender to have in in
Chelsea<00:01:45.600> send<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.409> Terry<00:01:46.829> 82<00:01:47.610> purely

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Chelsea send it back Terry 82 purely

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.480 
Chelsea send it back Terry 82 purely
because<00:01:48.299> he<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.810> getting<00:01:49.049> older<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.439> EA<00:01:50.040> just

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
because he is getting older and EA just

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.109 
because he is getting older and EA just

heirs<00:01:54.360> nodding<00:01:54.780> his<00:01:54.869> head<00:01:54.930> thinking<00:01:55.770> yep<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
heirs nodding his head thinking yep I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700 
heirs nodding his head thinking yep I
know<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.000> seven<00:01:57.390> once<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> yeah

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
know that I was a seven once and yeah

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.280 
know that I was a seven once and yeah
but<00:01:58.950> about<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> no<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.450> dairy<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.960> getting

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
but about that no but dairy is getting

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
but about that no but dairy is getting
old<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.399> he's<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.670> an<00:02:02.759> average

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
old now so I think he's at an average

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.389 
old now so I think he's at an average
season<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.200> good<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.770> maybe<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> van<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
season not as good as maybe a van a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
season not as good as maybe a van a
bitch<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> Cahill<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> put<00:02:06.810> him<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
bitch and Cahill but I put him on the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.400 
bitch and Cahill but I put him on the
stein<00:02:07.409> team<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.920> he<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> main<00:02:09.360> ones

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
stein team as he is one of the main ones

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.900 
stein team as he is one of the main ones
moving<00:02:10.410> over<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> Ivanovich<00:02:11.190> Ivanovich<00:02:11.670> one

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
moving over to Ivanovich Ivanovich one

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.830 
moving over to Ivanovich Ivanovich one
of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.360> better<00:02:12.569> play

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of the the better play

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.430 
of the the better play
is<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.290> had<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.709> season<00:02:14.660> 84<00:02:15.660> purely

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
is that have had this season 84 purely

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440 
is that have had this season 84 purely
because<00:02:16.560> he<00:02:16.860> has<00:02:16.980> been<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.160> tank<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.760> center<00:02:18.300> by

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
because he has been a tank in center by

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.330 
because he has been a tank in center by
now<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.870> believe<00:02:19.530> he's<00:02:19.680> came<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.160> right

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
now I believe he's came out of the right

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.070 
now I believe he's came out of the right
back<00:02:20.489> position<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.150> he<00:02:21.420> has<00:02:21.540> gone<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> send

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
back position and he has gone to send

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080 
back position and he has gone to send
her<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.260> apparently<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.879> that's<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
her back apparently so I think that's a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.430 
her back apparently so I think that's a
very<00:02:24.209> good<00:02:24.330> move<00:02:24.629> for<00:02:24.750> him<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.959> he's<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.170> very

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
very good move for him and he's a very

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.339 
very good move for him and he's a very
good<00:02:25.860> defender<00:02:26.580> very<00:02:26.849> solid<00:02:27.300> left<00:02:28.019> band<00:02:28.230> we've

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
good defender very solid left band we've

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.199 
good defender very solid left band we've
got<00:02:28.530> cold<00:02:28.830> again<00:02:28.980> he's<00:02:29.730> had<00:02:29.910> an<00:02:30.030> average

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
got cold again he's had an average

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.509 
got cold again he's had an average
season<00:02:30.900> i<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.410> purely<00:02:31.890> because<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
season i think but purely because of the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.690 
season i think but purely because of the
age<00:02:33.530> he's<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.610> get

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
age he's kind of just going to get

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.030 
age he's kind of just going to get
downgraded<00:02:35.970> slowly<00:02:36.629> like<00:02:36.900> ever<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.590> just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
downgraded slowly like ever and just

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.589 
downgraded slowly like ever and just
eventually<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.640> fall<00:02:38.879> out<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.150> play<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
eventually just fall out of play and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.660 
eventually just fall out of play and
eventually<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.650> come<00:02:41.040> off<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.310> map<00:02:41.489> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
eventually just come off the map and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.490 
eventually just come off the map and
just<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.910> left<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.269> will<00:02:42.420> take<00:02:42.569> his<00:02:42.720> place<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.470> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
just a left but will take his place so I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960 
just a left but will take his place so I
think<00:02:43.890> he's<00:02:43.980> had<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.099> good<00:02:44.250> season<00:02:44.310> don't<00:02:44.819> get

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
think he's had a good season don't get

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
think he's had a good season don't get
me<00:02:45.060> wrong<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.480> he<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.380> getting<00:02:46.650> older<00:02:46.739> and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
me wrong but he is getting older and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.069 
me wrong but he is getting older and
obviously<00:02:47.459> EI<00:02:47.670> will<00:02:47.940> take<00:02:48.360> advantage<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
obviously EI will take advantage of that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.690 
obviously EI will take advantage of that
and<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.680> has<00:02:49.860> sent<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.130> back<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.400> must<00:02:50.579> have

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and this has sent a back on must have

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.370 
and this has sent a back on must have
not<00:02:50.819> changed<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.239> send<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> defensive<00:02:51.840> mid<00:02:52.019> he

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
not changed to send a defensive mid he

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.100 
not changed to send a defensive mid he
will<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.890> Senate<00:02:53.459> defensive<00:02:53.819> mid<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.810> there

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
will go in Senate defensive mid in there

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.600 
will go in Senate defensive mid in there
no<00:02:55.380> doubt<00:02:55.680> he's<00:02:55.890> played<00:02:56.160> there<00:02:56.340> pretty<00:02:56.549> much

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
no doubt he's played there pretty much

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.789 
no doubt he's played there pretty much
most<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.180> season<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:58.260> he's<00:02:58.470> gonna<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:58.769> to

most of this season and he's gonna go to

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.890 
most of this season and he's gonna go to

in the BPL they're not going to get a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.520 
in the BPL they're not going to get a
tune<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.510> straight<00:03:57.780> away<00:03:57.930> even<00:03:58.290> though<00:03:58.319> both

tune on straight away even though both

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.229

of<00:03:58.739> them<00:03:58.859> have<00:03:58.980> had<00:03:59.130> brilliant<00:03:59.639> seasons

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
of them have had brilliant seasons

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.479 
of them have had brilliant seasons
matter<00:04:00.810> has<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.349> coming<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.709> with<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.859> bang<00:04:02.160> game

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
matter has it coming in with a bang game

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.520 
matter has it coming in with a bang game
five<00:04:02.790> mana<00:04:03.060> matches<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.690> row<00:04:03.720> with<00:04:04.169> his

five mana matches in a row with his

first full of matches I still don't

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.550 
first full of matches I still don't
think<00:04:06.060> he's<00:04:06.329> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:06.660> worth<00:04:06.780> 18<00:04:07.169> on<00:04:07.260> just

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
think he's going to be worth 18 on just

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.610 
think he's going to be worth 18 on just
yet<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.859> could<00:04:08.340> be<00:04:08.489> wrong<00:04:08.669> though<00:04:09.470> Lampard<00:04:10.470> I've

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
yet I could be wrong though Lampard I've

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.020 
yet I could be wrong though Lampard I've
already<00:04:10.889> done<00:04:11.130> before<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:11.730> want<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:11.910> check

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
already done before if you want to check

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.270 
already done before if you want to check
that<00:04:12.090> out<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.450> will<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.590> playlist<00:04:14.040> as

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
that out it will be in the playlist as

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.339 
that out it will be in the playlist as
well<00:04:14.579> on<00:04:14.849> on<00:04:15.090> one<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> playlist<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.320> the

well on on one of the playlist for the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.979 
well on on one of the playlist for the
predictions<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:17.700> again<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.060> think<00:04:18.090> he's<00:04:18.450> 84

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
predictions but again I think he's 84

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.380 
predictions but again I think he's 84
definite<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.459> pretty<00:04:20.669> much<00:04:20.789> all<00:04:20.969> I<00:04:21.030> just

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
definite that is pretty much all I just

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.969 
definite that is pretty much all I just
think<00:04:21.510> he's<00:04:21.599> at<00:04:21.659> a<00:04:21.690> great<00:04:21.930> season<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.409> he

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
think he's at a great season and he

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.469 
think he's at a great season and he
should<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.250> been<00:04:23.280> downgraded<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:24.270> much

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
should have been downgraded that much

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:24.740 
should have been downgraded that much
from

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
from

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.620 
from

only scored about 20 goals that is

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.550 
only scored about 20 goals that is
shocking<00:04:32.580> for<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> striker<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.660> his<00:04:33.810> caliber<00:04:34.230> he

shocking for a striker of his caliber he

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.350 
shocking for a striker of his caliber he

Lampard<00:04:39.420> Lewis<00:04:39.920> Denver<00:04:40.920> bar<00:04:41.040> doesn't<00:04:41.220> really

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
Lampard Lewis Denver bar doesn't really

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580 
Lampard Lewis Denver bar doesn't really
play<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.700> him<00:04:41.850> apparently<00:04:41.910> so<00:04:42.420> again<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.440> just

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
play with him apparently so again I just

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.740 
play with him apparently so again I just

of<00:05:00.540> people<00:05:00.720> probably<00:05:00.840> think<00:05:01.110> that's<00:05:01.230> a<00:05:01.380> bit

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
of people probably think that's a bit

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.830

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
harsh to put him in a tee but apparently

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.659 
harsh to put him in a tee but apparently

really good games of really bad games

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.690 
really good games of really bad games
which<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.530> definitely<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:07.950> consistent<00:05:08.580> and

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
which is definitely not consistent and

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.580 
which is definitely not consistent and

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
games so really you can't really upgrade

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.670 
games so really you can't really upgrade
or<00:05:18.120> downgrade<00:05:18.150> him<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:18.810> he<00:05:19.260> hasn't<00:05:19.380> really

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
or downgrade him as he hasn't really

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.409 
or downgrade him as he hasn't really
played<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.400> I've<00:05:20.520> just<00:05:20.550> kept<00:05:20.910> him<00:05:21.030> as<00:05:21.120> normal

the<00:05:45.990> kind<00:05:46.380> of<00:05:46.470> Butch's<00:05:47.190> center<00:05:47.729> back<00:05:47.880> in<00:05:47.910> the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
the kind of Butch's center back in the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.390 
the kind of Butch's center back in the
league<00:05:48.360> but<00:05:48.570> he<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.169> definitely<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.620> very<00:05:49.710> solid

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
league but he is definitely a very solid

league but he is definitely a very solid
center<00:05:50.669> back<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.030> very<00:05:51.330> very<00:05:52.260> contestant
