thank<00:00:00.210> you<00:00:00.299> -<00:00:00.510> I'm<00:00:01.020> doing<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.560> tutorial<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:02.460> how

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
thank you - I'm doing a tutorial on how

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.700 
thank you - I'm doing a tutorial on how
to<00:00:02.730> fix<00:00:03.210> your<00:00:03.570> ps3<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> keep<00:00:04.500> shutting

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
to fix your ps3 going to keep shutting

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
to fix your ps3 going to keep shutting
off<00:00:04.920> byte<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.930> as<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.080> can<00:00:07.230> see<00:00:08.630> it's

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
off byte so as you can see it's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.580 
off byte so as you can see it's
happening<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:10.260> ps3<00:00:10.590> give<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.730> second<00:00:15.590> so

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
happening to my ps3 give it a second so

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.080 
happening to my ps3 give it a second so
you<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.980> yellow<00:00:17.190> light<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.460> turns<00:00:17.970> out

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
you get that yellow light and turns out

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.290 
you get that yellow light and turns out
by<00:00:18.270> itself<00:00:18.680> obviously<00:00:19.680> there's<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.850> problem

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
by itself obviously there's your problem

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.109 
by itself obviously there's your problem
with<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.779> ps3<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.039> found<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.460> way<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> fix<00:00:23.939> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
with my ps3 but I found a way to fix it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.509 
with my ps3 but I found a way to fix it
so<00:00:24.650> temporary<00:00:25.650> face<00:00:26.010> you're<00:00:26.160> probably<00:00:26.310> gonna

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so temporary face you're probably gonna

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.029 
so temporary face you're probably gonna
have<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.080> over<00:00:28.080> again<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.680> couple

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
have to do this over again a couple

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:39.549 
have to do this over again a couple
times

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.529 

okay<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.340> recommend<00:00:40.789> doing<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.239> with<00:00:41.449> the

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
okay I recommend doing this with the

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.860 
okay I recommend doing this with the
disk<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.020> going<00:00:42.260> on<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.539> have<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.660> push

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
disk you going on just you have a push

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.780 
disk you going on just you have a push
to<00:00:44.989> do<00:00:47.019> then<00:00:48.019> you<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:48.379> keep<00:00:49.250> pushing<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.699> in

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
to do then you just keep pushing it in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.759 
to do then you just keep pushing it in
there<00:00:49.969> but<00:00:50.149> don't<00:00:50.329> let<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.540> go<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:53.469> you<00:00:54.469> have<00:00:54.649> to

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
there but don't let it go in you have to

00:00:54.769 --> 00:02:23.900 
there but don't let it go in you have to
do<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.039> couple<00:00:55.070> times<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.850> get<00:00:55.970> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170 

see<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.390> off<00:02:25.650> look<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.180> just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
see you now it's off look at that just

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.720 
see you now it's off look at that just
fixed<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:29.590> not<00:02:29.769> Turing<00:02:30.040> off<00:02:30.220> by<00:02:30.400> itself

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
fixed it it's not Turing off by itself

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.059 
fixed it it's not Turing off by itself
takes<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.360> couple<00:02:31.510> tries<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.170> eventually<00:02:32.620> get

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
takes a couple tries but eventually get

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.449 
takes a couple tries but eventually get
it<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.050> once<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.140> turn<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.440> off<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:36.280> could

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
it and once you turn it off you could

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.880 
it and once you turn it off you could
turn<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> back<00:02:36.879> on<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:37.239> still<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.599> work

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
turn it back on it's still going to work

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.229 
turn it back on it's still going to work
but<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.069> if<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.370> don't<00:02:39.489> use<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.819> for<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:40.030> while

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
but like if you don't use it for a while

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.229 
but like if you don't use it for a while
you<00:02:40.599> could<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.989> do<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.290> again<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:43.060> there

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
you could have to do this again so there

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.379 
you could have to do this again so there
you<00:02:43.360> go<00:02:43.480> that's<00:02:43.930> your<00:02:44.080> video
