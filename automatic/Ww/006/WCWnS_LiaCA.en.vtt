about<00:01:32.490> guns<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:34.079> could<00:01:34.229> write<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> back

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
about guns is we could write on the back

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
about guns is we could write on the back
of<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> stamp<00:01:35.130> everyone<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> guns<00:01:36.799> but

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
of a stamp everyone know that guns but

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.789 
of a stamp everyone know that guns but
I'm<00:01:37.920> presuming<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.900> for<00:01:39.900> realism<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
I'm presuming it's for realism because I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.130 
I'm presuming it's for realism because I
can't<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.400> why<00:01:41.700> extended<00:01:42.210> mags<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.930> mean

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
can't see why extended mags would mean

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.469 
can't see why extended mags would mean
an<00:01:43.290> unbalanced<00:01:44.040> game<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.270> it'll<00:01:45.390> be

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
an unbalanced game but I think it'll be

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
an unbalanced game but I think it'll be
overpowered<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> npl<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
overpowered on the npl you can see the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.210 
overpowered on the npl you can see the
sim<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.840> there's<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.290> grenade<00:01:49.619> launcher

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
sim for you there's but grenade launcher

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.560 
sim for you there's but grenade launcher
and<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.399> those<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> things<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.420> that's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and all those kind of things when that's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
and all those kind of things when that's
obviously<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> most<00:01:52.350> powerful<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
obviously one of the most powerful and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
obviously one of the most powerful and
most<00:01:53.100> well<00:01:54.090> known<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> best

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
most well known to be one of the best

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.980 
most well known to be one of the best
guns<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.590> black<00:01:55.799> ops<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.479> I'm<00:01:57.479> presuming<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
guns in black ops so I'm presuming to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.950 
guns in black ops so I'm presuming to
the<00:01:58.229> realism<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:59.490> example<00:01:59.969> none<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the realism for example none of the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
the realism for example none of the
other<00:02:01.110> submachine<00:02:01.680> guns<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.790> grenade

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
other submachine guns can have a grenade

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.969 
other submachine guns can have a grenade
launcher<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.689> least<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.530> other

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
launcher on least I don't think so other

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.809 
launcher on least I don't think so other
than<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.310> case<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.099> mean<00:02:08.489> called

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
than I case in for you so I mean called

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699 
than I case in for you so I mean called
you<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> one<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.420> games<00:02:09.720> where<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.379> sort

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you is one of these games where it sort

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.980 
you is one of these games where it sort
of<00:02:10.860> has<00:02:11.129> this

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
of has this

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.170 
of has this
I<00:02:12.990> don't<00:02:13.770> know<00:02:13.860> veneers<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.640> word<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.000> kind

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
I don't know veneers right word it kind

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.810 
I don't know veneers right word it kind
of<00:02:15.210> has<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.510> look<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:17.100> goes<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.490> realism

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
of has this look of it goes for realism

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.630 
of has this look of it goes for realism
but<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:19.080> course<00:02:19.440> there's<00:02:19.740> little<00:02:19.950> twists<00:02:20.430> I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
but of course there's little twists I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.430 
but of course there's little twists I
mean<00:02:20.850> obviously<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.300> game<00:02:21.480> plays<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.020> being

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
mean obviously the game plays and being

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.560 
mean obviously the game plays and being
a<00:02:22.470> sting<00:02:22.710> because<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.070> don't<00:02:23.190> die<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.450> then

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
a sting because you don't die and then

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.750 
a sting because you don't die and then
respawn<00:02:25.050> again<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> can't<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.460> couldn't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
respawn again and you can't you couldn't

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520 
respawn again and you can't you couldn't
actually<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.600> run<00:02:27.990> along<00:02:28.110> while

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually you know run along while

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.200 
actually you know run along while
getting<00:02:28.830> shot<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.340> know<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.520> can't<00:02:29.820> get<00:02:29.970> shot

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
getting shot you know you can't get shot

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.670 
getting shot you know you can't get shot
in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> leg<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.600> sniper<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.350> carry<00:02:31.590> on

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
in the leg with sniper and just carry on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.110 
in the leg with sniper and just carry on
like<00:02:31.860> normal<00:02:32.040> after<00:02:32.430> 10<00:02:32.610> seconds<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
like normal after 10 seconds so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.140 
like normal after 10 seconds so
obviously<00:02:33.810> there's<00:02:34.050> going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.350> be<00:02:34.380> lots<00:02:34.770> of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
obviously there's going to be lots of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.310 
obviously there's going to be lots of
things<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.300> aren't<00:02:36.570> realistic<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.110> make<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
things that aren't realistic to make the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.650 
things that aren't realistic to make the
gameplay<00:02:37.680> fun<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> guns

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
gameplay fun but I think with the guns

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.440 
gameplay fun but I think with the guns
they<00:02:39.900> try<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.320> as<00:02:40.410> close<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.680> possible

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
they try and get as close as possible

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.370 
they try and get as close as possible
although<00:02:42.450> I've<00:02:42.660> always<00:02:42.810> thought<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
although I've always thought that you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
although I've always thought that you
know<00:02:43.500> recoil<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.190> gangs<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> bit

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
know recoil and gangs is a bit

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.310 
know recoil and gangs is a bit
ridiculous<00:02:45.210> when<00:02:45.750> compared<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.050> real<00:02:46.290> life

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
ridiculous when compared to real life

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.890 
ridiculous when compared to real life
recall<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.760> very<00:02:47.940> few<00:02:48.120> exceptions<00:02:48.180> if

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
recall with very few exceptions if

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
recall with very few exceptions if
anyone's<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> shotgun<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> mean<00:02:50.340> I've<00:02:50.460> only

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
anyone's in a shotgun I mean I've only

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.940 
anyone's in a shotgun I mean I've only
shot<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> few<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.470> shooting<00:02:52.470> guns<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:52.830> real

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
shot a few but shooting guns in real

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
life and shooting guns in the game is

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.810 
life and shooting guns in the game is
they're<00:02:54.330> very<00:02:54.690> different<00:02:54.930> experience<00:02:55.830> but

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
they're very different experience but

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.970 
they're very different experience but
for<00:02:57.030> me<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.330> don't<00:02:57.570> play<00:02:57.810> games<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.560> mean

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
for me I don't play games I mean

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.410 
for me I don't play games I mean
specifically<00:02:59.610> obviously<00:02:59.940> first<00:03:00.120> person

shooter<00:03:00.660> don't<00:03:00.870> place<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.320> at<00:03:01.440> games<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
shooter don't place you at games for the

shooter don't place you at games for the
realism<00:03:03.360> experience<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.370> suppose<00:03:06.330> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
realism experience I kind of I suppose I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.000 
realism experience I kind of I suppose I
don't<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.320> way<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.770> not

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
don't know I like the way that it's not

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.970 
don't know I like the way that it's not
completely<00:03:08.960> sci-fi<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.230> out<00:03:10.440> there<00:03:10.740> you<00:03:10.860> know

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
a few guns in there that added something

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.630 
a few guns in there that added something
to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> game<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.500> know<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:08.070> me<00:04:08.190> it's<00:04:08.370> it's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
again it's I don't enjoy it because it's

real<00:04:11.910> guns<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.600> mean<00:04:13.320> I<00:04:13.410> enjoy<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.800> look

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
real guns I mean I enjoy the look

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.220 
real guns I mean I enjoy the look
because<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.370> real<00:04:14.760> people<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:15.900> know<00:04:16.020> we

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
because in real people and you know we

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.450 
because in real people and you know we
you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.470> you're<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.770> running<00:04:16.950> around<00:04:17.280> as

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
you know you're not running around as

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.520 
you know you're not running around as
dinosaurs<00:04:18.150> we've<00:04:18.359> guns<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.750> your<00:04:18.870> hands<00:04:19.230> but<00:04:19.470> I

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
dinosaurs we've guns in your hands but I

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.140 
dinosaurs we've guns in your hands but I
like<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:19.739> realism<00:04:20.100> in<00:04:20.310> that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
like the realism in that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.760 
like the realism in that
aspect<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:22.019> know<00:04:22.109> you're<00:04:22.290> not<00:04:22.350> you're<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.590> on

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
aspect you know you're not you're not on

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.310 
aspect you know you're not you're not on
the<00:04:22.889> moon<00:04:23.040> or<00:04:23.280> ever<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:23.940> real<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.870> terms<00:04:25.139> of

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
the moon or ever it's real in terms of

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140 
the moon or ever it's real in terms of
the<00:04:25.710> setting<00:04:26.190> but<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.580> terms<00:04:26.759> of<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.970> actual

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the setting but in terms of the actual

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.460 
the setting but in terms of the actual
guns<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:28.470> think<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.220> kind<00:04:29.729> of<00:04:30.289> prohibits<00:04:31.289> the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
guns I think that kind of prohibits the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.189 
guns I think that kind of prohibits the
creativity<00:04:31.949> of<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.669> crate<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.720> little<00:04:34.020> bit

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
creativity of the crate is a little bit

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.810 
creativity of the crate is a little bit
I<00:04:34.229> don't<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.560> if<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.770> does<00:04:34.919> but<00:04:35.310> I'm<00:04:35.490> sure

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
I don't know if it does but I'm sure

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.010 
I don't know if it does but I'm sure
they'd<00:04:36.000> probably<00:04:36.240> say<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.509> because<00:04:36.810> it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
they'd probably say that because it's

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.210 
they'd probably say that because it's
probably<00:04:37.289> quite<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.530> few<00:04:37.710> guns<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:38.039> likes

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
probably quite a few guns it likes

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.800 
probably quite a few guns it likes
putting<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.669> they<00:04:38.850> may<00:04:39.000> be<00:04:39.060> can't<00:04:39.389> because

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
putting that they may be can't because

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.680 
putting that they may be can't because
it<00:04:40.320> wouldn't<00:04:40.620> balance<00:04:40.770> were<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.340> game<00:04:41.690> so

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
it wouldn't balance were in the game so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.070 
it wouldn't balance were in the game so

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
ridiculous guns that have ridiculous

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.960 
ridiculous guns that have ridiculous
abilities<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:08.010> wouldn't<00:05:08.460> be<00:05:08.699> able<00:05:08.789> to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
abilities that wouldn't be able to

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.750 
abilities that wouldn't be able to
happen<00:05:09.270> in<00:05:09.360> real<00:05:09.570> life<00:05:09.600> like<00:05:10.229> say<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.919> don't

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
happen in real life like say I don't

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760 
happen in real life like say I don't
know<00:05:11.910> much<00:05:12.090> about<00:05:12.120> guns<00:05:12.510> or<00:05:12.750> weapons<00:05:12.780> but<00:05:13.530> I'm

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
know much about guns or weapons but I'm

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.680 
know much about guns or weapons but I'm
guessing<00:05:14.160> that<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.639> couldn't<00:05:15.030> have<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.300> gun

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
guessing that you couldn't have a gun

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.580 
guessing that you couldn't have a gun
that<00:05:15.930> had<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:18.030> shot<00:05:18.449> a<00:05:18.660> million<00:05:19.259> rounds<00:05:19.380> a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
that had that shot a million rounds a

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230 
that had that shot a million rounds a
second<00:05:19.979> I<00:05:20.099> know<00:05:20.160> it's<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.370> completely<00:05:20.729> random

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
second I know it's a completely random

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.070 
second I know it's a completely random
thing<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.690> say<00:05:21.870> but<00:05:22.340> guns<00:05:23.340> that<00:05:23.580> could<00:05:24.449> could

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
thing to say but guns that could could

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.980 
thing to say but guns that could could
be<00:05:25.349> made<00:05:25.560> but<00:05:26.250> aren't<00:05:26.639> real<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.180> would<00:05:27.840> like

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
be made but aren't real I would like

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.420 
be made but aren't real I would like
that<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.349> game<00:05:28.500> because<00:05:28.770> then<00:05:28.919> also<00:05:29.070> think

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
that in the game because then also think

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.320 
that in the game because then also think
that<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.669> means<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:29.970> they<00:05:30.060> could<00:05:30.210> have

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
that that means that they could have

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.930 
that that means that they could have
more<00:05:30.630> guns<00:05:30.960> in<00:05:31.199> the<00:05:31.289> game<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.680> for<00:05:32.160> me<00:05:32.310> one<00:05:32.910> of

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
more guns in the game and for me one of

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.270 
more guns in the game and for me one of
the<00:05:33.120> main<00:05:33.389> draws<00:05:33.660> are<00:05:33.870> called<00:05:34.110> ue<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.800> the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
the main draws are called ue and the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.890 
the main draws are called ue and the
whole<00:05:35.430> call<00:05:35.639> duty<00:05:35.789> series<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.330> black<00:05:36.510> ops<00:05:36.750> is

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
whole call duty series in black ops is

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.950 
whole call duty series in black ops is
the<00:05:37.740> customization<00:05:38.699> of<00:05:38.789> your<00:05:39.210> gun<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.630> your

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
the customization of your gun and your

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.600 
the customization of your gun and your
class<00:05:40.199> I<00:05:40.409> think<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.800> is<00:05:40.919> one<00:05:41.099> of<00:05:41.130> its<00:05:41.250> main

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
class I think that is one of its main

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.460 
class I think that is one of its main
successes<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.419> especially<00:05:43.020> one<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.380> the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
successes and especially one of the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.629 
successes and especially one of the
reasons<00:05:43.710> why<00:05:43.830> it's<00:05:43.949> such<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.159> success<00:05:44.490> on

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
reasons why it's such a success on

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.550 
reasons why it's such a success on
YouTube<00:05:44.760> because<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.360> can<00:05:45.630> talk<00:05:45.930> about<00:05:45.960> all

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
YouTube because you can talk about all

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.920 
YouTube because you can talk about all
the<00:05:46.919> different<00:05:46.949> types<00:05:47.789> of<00:05:48.060> setups<00:05:48.630> you<00:05:48.750> can

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
the different types of setups you can

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.240 
the different types of setups you can
have<00:05:49.139> and<00:05:49.320> all<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.500> different<00:05:49.830> types<00:05:50.039> of

have and all the different types of

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.339 
have and all the different types of
things<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.240> can<00:05:51.419> run<00:05:51.659> to<00:05:51.870> make<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.199> game

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
things you can run to make the game

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.020 
things you can run to make the game
interesting<00:05:52.520> customize<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:53.789> make<00:05:54.000> it

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
interesting customize it and make it

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.860 
interesting customize it and make it
your<00:05:54.300> own<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.750> mean<00:05:54.900> there's<00:05:55.080> other<00:05:55.530> games<00:05:55.919> like

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
your own I mean there's other games like

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.899 
your own I mean there's other games like
say<00:05:57.870> medal<00:05:58.229> of<00:05:58.289> honor<00:05:58.500> for<00:05:58.590> example<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.610> other

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
say medal of honor for example and other

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.850 
say medal of honor for example and other
games<00:06:00.030> like<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.360> I<00:06:00.810> have<00:06:00.960> contracts<00:06:01.740> you

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
games like that I have contracts you

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.839 
games like that I have contracts you
remember<00:06:02.070> too<00:06:02.190> much<00:06:02.220> about<00:06:02.340> them<00:06:02.639> in<00:06:02.729> detail

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
remember too much about them in detail

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.610 
remember too much about them in detail
don't<00:06:03.300> play<00:06:03.449> them<00:06:03.599> that<00:06:03.810> much<00:06:03.930> so<00:06:04.229> don't<00:06:04.500> have

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
don't play them that much so don't have

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.070 
don't play them that much so don't have
that<00:06:04.770> aspect<00:06:05.250> of<00:06:05.400> coming<00:06:06.210> back<00:06:06.419> trying<00:06:06.900> out

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
that aspect of coming back trying out

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.390 
that aspect of coming back trying out
something<00:06:07.320> else<00:06:07.620> trying<00:06:08.039> out<00:06:08.130> something

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
something else trying out something

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.129 
something else trying out something
absurd<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.389> I<00:06:09.449> think<00:06:09.659> that's<00:06:09.780> another<00:06:09.990> thing

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
absurd that I think that's another thing

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.300 
absurd that I think that's another thing
and<00:06:10.289> people<00:06:10.409> really<00:06:10.620> like<00:06:10.860> better<00:06:11.070> called

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
and people really like better called

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.610 
and people really like better called

juiciest I mean you can put I know you
can<00:06:13.710> just<00:06:13.830> make<00:06:14.130> classes<00:06:15.000> up<00:06:15.120> for<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.360> fun<00:06:15.539> of

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
can just make classes up for the fun of

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.330 
can just make classes up for the fun of
it<00:06:15.750> there's<00:06:15.930> no<00:06:16.020> real<00:06:16.199> advantage<00:06:16.289> but<00:06:16.979> they're

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
it there's no real advantage but they're

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.330 
it there's no real advantage but they're
there<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.669> do<00:06:17.849> so<00:06:18.150> for<00:06:18.360> me<00:06:18.479> if<00:06:18.690> you<00:06:18.720> could<00:06:19.080> add

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
there to do so for me if you could add

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.060
