00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.270
 second part of knitting bootees 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.550
 and now we will knit the transition 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.550
 from the sole to the side 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.930
 I knitted this row when 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.779
 ends sole and begins already 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:36.520
 the rim is this row we will now 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.520
 knit for this 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:52.059
 one lift loop and now we will 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 knit not for loops as usual there for 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:59.980
 back we knit 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 or here for here on this side here for 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.960
 these loops we will not for them we will 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.780
 knit columns without wrapping sc 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:21.210
 the column of the previous row, that is, we enter 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 hook on the wrong side like that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 right to left curl around see 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.399
 grab 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:49.410
 thread and pulling and tying column 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:55.220
 without nakida next with purl 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.220
 hand we enter the hook between the posts 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:11.070
 This is how we grab the thread 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:21.120
 we stretch it and we knit a column without 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:23.090
 on the next stitch enter the hook with 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.800
 seamy side 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:34.940
 wrap the crochet previous 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:40.110
 on the bottom of the row and stretch the thread and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.620
 we knit a column without nakida and accurately 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.860
 also all the posts 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:56.300
 we twist and knit 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.300
 in crochets like this 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.390
 we hook 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.960
 we twist the bar in this way 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.960
 grab the thread stretch 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:28.090
 and knit a column in the sign 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:32.360
 re-enter the hook twist the column 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:40.210
 grab the thread and stretch it 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.210
 and knit a column without nakida 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.190
 and it turns out like this we are strengthening 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:36.669
 our sole becomes very so 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:39.340
 there is plump so we knit 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.760
 further to the end of the series that is 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.040
 round the row until that is the end 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:53.740
 that's the way we should 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 get continue to knit doveal 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:03.450
 transitional row from the sole to the edge 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:09.729
 now we need to knit 2 rows 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:15.160
 side knit crocheted in columns 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:22.479
 each loop has one pillar 3 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:27.840
 air loops and first loop 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.840
 begin to knit crochet 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.140
 so on 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.729
 with knit crochet 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:09.010
 so this is the first 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.010
 we end up knitting in a circle 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:16.540
 here we finish the connecting bar 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:20.990
 then second row 3 air loops and 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.150
 double crochet 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.400
 one more row ie we need to knit 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:30.910
 2 rows with double crochets 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.910
 continue and behind him 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.740
 finished the second part of knitting we 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:43.910
 knit transitional series from the sole 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:47.419
 side and two rows with double crochets 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:55.030
 most of the rim we got here 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:55.030
 so the sole is strengthened apparently well 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:04.990
 all is not deformed 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.990
 fault. well and worth and keeps its shape 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:09.069
 it happened
