00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:06.350
 in terms of text messages and good calls the team behaves very 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.530
 all right 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.089
 what to say 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.639
 in the forum message you have the t9 keyboard with any clear proposed cell 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.219
 exception here 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.019
 To write like that 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.880
 letter by letter stitched with sm 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.489
 in which 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.119
 few artists lic 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.470
 yes clear robert e 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.110
 It's very good 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.110
 this points fast and it costs a bit to get used to 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.240
 with hitting him 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 you can can 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.300
 and well after the judge ceased 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.470
 the good sector is detects housing 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.649
 the networks 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.460
 p the fast 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 your friend that the player does not have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.740
 in java 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.070
 then no you can not 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 I give everything and those things 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.940
 between good as to go closing after 7 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 with a phone, do not be more listen well 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 and I called they listen to me well or there's no bigger problem with that 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.750
 this keyboard and medium 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.810
 is the key 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.550
 multitask 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.170
 that having this came up in this month a tab 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.359
 percent and access photo ap is to the favorites in which we have put 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.100
 go avoiding and putting the most used things 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.179
 and keep the lock you also have the applications open 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420
 for example if we go and open 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.090
 percent 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.100
 any application 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 p we press the cut button and it returns 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.800
 how many arteta showed so this 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.590
 I can go back to the start screen 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.860
 i do anything else here it looks like an icon 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 morante does not want to see 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.830
 the same economist did not vote 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.720
 kessel said multitasking and academies to choose 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.510
 end all and teresa while 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.659
 or you can 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is exchanging applications 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 as legal 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.360
 of cherry 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.689
 finally I will give you some opinions on 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.249
 because it seems to me that they should buy this phone or not 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.810
 by the way, mainly if your fan of photos 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.439
 nothing of the team p 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.739
 very good they have very good function 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.359
 academics for the description did not leave anything photos so they can see 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.249
 both with a plan without flash 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.889
 and see all that I said this is the definition that is very good 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.809
 and also about the bad things like the flash that of the porous in dark 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:42.159
 I read in the general relationship is acceptable equipment and that is not not 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.639
 for slower civil 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.859
 they have not been the problem 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.329
 in hospitality more applications since then eighth tenth will be left that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.679
 He is very agile 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.469
 and today it does not have 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.739
 the lie features worthy of 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.209
 DesprÃ©s the team as sartre gv dies of camera 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.659
 3 inch screen gps 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.249
 why I would not buy it 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.219
 he was to know they would be 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.629
 is a fallacy that has the phone as a telephone itself 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.399
 as for example when works of messages 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.699
 from lara 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.410
 the ring where 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 reception message is not at all clear 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.589
 spot to put the united kingdom you want 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.430
 but it lasts a few seconds and 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.389
 to the healthy time 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.749
 did not return to warn thesis that you did not hear 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.329
 and also not the address to your wedding because the relationship is a must ref 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.229
 and nothing else I'm not going to take from never again 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.299
 and if not what 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.269
 if they do not say and you did not hear 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.679
 you were there is no way 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.679
 I will vegara a program and nobody has already done 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:53.430
 the alarm 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.849
 d 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 for the loser another great subject 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.789
 bad buyvip 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:01.760
 the alarm 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.040
 that sounds very, very low 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.980
 the volume 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 do not wake up but not crazy about a good dream 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.390
 and the worst that in my manual injury 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.619
 I can 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.390
 on how to increase the volume 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.129
 which I assume can not be done for 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.139
 nowhere does he mention 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.210
 much to the common equipment options 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.729
 in 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.900
 ta counting as in the manual 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.979
 there we have nothing more there will be a summer time 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.189
 I do not know kuchar 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.259
 and good finally 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.259
 the operative success theme that in each one well 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.300
 it is not do not want to add the applications for the wider operating system 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.639
 as he pointed out in a moment 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.569
 since for example the gps 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.759
 almost useless day 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.770
 because I'm still installing a map to use it 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.139
 per cent without spending credit you can not 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.139
 that cap with the white label program 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.620
 but the truth is pasta before worse program 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.610
 nothing more because it is a java application not 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.289
 I do not have anything against witral people are actually the only ones who can do 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.910
 but good academy showed the map a bit but nobody 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.409
 very good trucho 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.860
 nothing to do with the garmin 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.330
 and good java applications appear these 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.389
 the clash that immolate 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.680
 will be in the different physical keys of any cell phone so in bags with 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 he the numbers 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.770
 in short I think not to forget anything 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.850
 and well I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.039
 development and that has brought them the two that I had on the team 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.130
 i anything like that and have yet another doubt can 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.400
 they asked astral 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.789
 comments you want
