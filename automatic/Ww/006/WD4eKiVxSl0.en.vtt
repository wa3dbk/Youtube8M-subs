 Good morning, good morning, guys, what's your line? 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:15.900
 40 this morning today 29-27 and 2015 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 It seems silly and I go from one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 thing to never tell you is that at 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 Sometimes novice can help and have a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 corner also want to break the face 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.160
 almost there you know what this one is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.640
 huh 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 this here is the brake a friedman doll 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 it was ugly stationary that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 this one from the cart and if it is not down 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.660
 it just comes back and is there a job here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 for an eventuality said dawn was to give 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 one on something carries a lot 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.910
 pushing a lot of horse gives a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.600
 hold on my hand talk about this one 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.729
 only this brake was stationary 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.650
 Scania Stationary 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.640
 As I said in the previous video, you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 can use it as a normal brake 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.950
 if large here one gradually but not 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.799
 This is what I want to tell you, if 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.189
 pulled stationary brake stopped beauty 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.170
 but there is a detail you are on a rise 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:32.850
 very strong and very loaded said 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.850
 that will not insure everything does not have sun 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 freight truck 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 depending on your life you have to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'll show you all I have 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.710
 this pió wedge is the case today chaos to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.869
 also had a very 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.280
 strong 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:59.180
 else I think the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.180
 reward here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.420
 now i will do what the emergency brake 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.800
 we 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:15.510
 I'll lead then if you stop at a 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.170
 very strong climb you come there and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 Security, but you forgot, huh? 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.900
 drop if you do not boot with uxía 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.970
 dragging reviews 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.760
 I saw the driver in the room and dragged 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.270
 quality is a problem that 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.950
 I do not know how many I do not think the libero 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 blogger with the problem 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.050
 each one looks there and not only to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.300
 park 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.209
 I know they saw a lot of people drop. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.010
 arrives there in the pact without date cart and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.870
 the cart did not come down a little bit 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.030
 there and it was only stationary 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.570
 the other good driver goes there engages one 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.730
 You know the clean sheet is yet to 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.920
 car carreta carreta state 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.790
 she called mechanic say 'never wheel 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.530
 braked and sometimes it's just the brake set 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.989
 very strong climb 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.080
 something if it arrives free and 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 check the stationary fryer pulling 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.459
 You're not supposed to be able to work. 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.459
 when they stopped the very strong climb comes 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.220
 safe from chaos to have the security of 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.040
 A time out will leave the truck. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.959
 the impulse was stationary to stop the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.110
 Emergency brake that locks everything 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.810
 cart brake and frei side inside 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.180
