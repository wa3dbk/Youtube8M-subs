00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
part of it we're going to talk just a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.780

second about red eye and red eyes

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.060 
second about red eye and red eyes
basically<00:00:37.090> what<00:00:37.510> happens<00:00:37.840> when<00:00:38.140> you<00:00:38.770> use<00:00:39.040> a

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
basically what happens when you use a

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.069 
basically what happens when you use a
flash<00:00:39.489> that's<00:00:39.910> on<00:00:40.090> your<00:00:40.270> camera<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:40.840> the

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
flash that's on your camera and the

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.630 
flash that's on your camera and the
flash<00:00:41.230> produces<00:00:41.800> quite<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.040> bit<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.280> light<00:00:42.460> that

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
flash produces quite a bit of light that

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.000 
flash produces quite a bit of light that
shines<00:00:43.000> off<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.450> pupil<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.079> eye<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.530> then

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
shines off the pupil in the eye and then

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.849 
shines off the pupil in the eye and then
that<00:00:45.160> reflects<00:00:45.609> back<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.170> camera<00:00:47.620> so

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
that reflects back in to the camera so

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.169 
that reflects back in to the camera so
this<00:00:47.980> is<00:00:48.160> an<00:00:48.250> effect<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.789> get<00:00:48.940> when

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
this is an effect that you get when

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.849 
this is an effect that you get when
you're<00:00:49.329> using<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.750> flash<00:00:49.989> that's<00:00:50.289> actually<00:00:50.679> on

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
you're using a flash that's actually on

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.340 
you're using a flash that's actually on
your<00:00:51.670> camera<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.390> avoid<00:00:52.719> redeye<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.230> your

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
your camera so to avoid redeye in your

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.650 
your camera so to avoid redeye in your
images<00:00:53.679> try<00:00:53.949> using<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.370> flash<00:00:54.670> that's<00:00:54.999> a<00:00:55.269> little

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
images try using a flash that's a little

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.299 
images try using a flash that's a little
bit<00:00:55.780> larger<00:00:56.199> maybe<00:00:56.469> not<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.769> on-camera<00:00:57.280> flash

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
bit larger maybe not the on-camera flash

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.459
