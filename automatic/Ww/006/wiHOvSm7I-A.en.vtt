00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it's not really touching the surface so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.990 
it's not really touching the surface so
that's<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.720> great<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.280> notice<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> AG

UAG<00:02:01.680> didn't<00:02:02.100> really<00:02:02.340> mention<00:02:02.550> what<00:02:03.270> these

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

cutouts are for but I think it's for my
index<00:02:06.390> finger<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.960> rest<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.380> while<00:02:07.680> holding

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the case as you can see here and if I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.860

rest on when holding the case however I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.750 
rest on when holding the case however I
wish<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.440> left<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.770> little<00:02:25.890> bit<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.160> plastic
