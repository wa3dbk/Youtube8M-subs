00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.750
 Werner Bartens the winner goalkeeper of the past few weeks then begins 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.320
 stay out because Bergmann trusts the Sturmduo as well as this one 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.299
 This season, however, still scoreless 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.419
 Fun courage and enthusiasm for himself miner from his crew morning in 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.119
 Germany where you were born because you pay the interest Klose 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.939
 as she builds room for it, the last minute of the cycle also celebrated for June 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.079
 and more space for Asuag 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.939
 the opening goal a compulsory event a poem for 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.159
 Mimoun Azouagh the butterball transport that is there namely 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.110
 There were three lines defenders injured today they have themselves 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.440
 compiled and still lived consumption in Germany 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 at 1live 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.820
 because completely overlooked by the VfL 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 the weak spot is this on the right defensive side 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.050
 in Germany from Johansson for the first time ever ran for the defender 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.950
 also for Babbel 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.950
 we will hear you in 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.530
 the aggressiveness demanded by Bergmann lending volume nevertheless 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.530
 completely off 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 Stefan Leitl is quite different in Germany, and that's a perfect one 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 Long distance it fit in the front and on Dr 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.970
 second goal copies for 90 minutes is actually fit enough but for the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 first 20 got his choice 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140
 Contador so indicates at stake 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.850
 it's a puzzle 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.610
 for Andreas Bergmann 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.710
 to the plates 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.480
 unfortunately in vain 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 and then let Bergmann ask 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 receive the money 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.690
 because playing in Germany is always something going on that is due to a decent 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.090
 Attack but also that the jagged fend off there you are pretty 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.090
 undisturbed or just on the world 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.270
 the goal of the match is to be the first season to book 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.819
 Daniela Meyer also said Jordan is the first to disappoint 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.900
 Although Stammkeepers Kirstein is standing against the sun anyway 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
 that a clear goalkeeper error 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 take a deep breath 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.409
 Setting up Chong Tese has definitely been worthwhile 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:33.609
 I did not necessarily feel like I was playing with Stalin before 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.479
 the break in Germany again the turn Moritz Hartmann 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.949
 Hesselbarth or Andreas 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.949
 Uwer 3 1 in every shot a hit 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.590
 By way of exception, God in Germany on Rezidor all ways open 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.590
 you wanted full braking to the train 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.849
 Andreasberg man in his fourth game 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 so intend ours 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.989
 in the latter group with Villarreal the FC Thun and Langnau was continued 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.219
 expanded 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.399
 after the break countered then Oliver Bierhoff search 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.399
 this one is usually better 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.309
 At that time Germany was still two and a half years ago had its last 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.750
 Competitive game won at that time for Hoffenheim for this summer in 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.749
 Ingolstadt 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.200
 All points brought home is extremely home strong 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.639
 again he was strong after 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.369
 again leads to the goal 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 and again with the connecting goal 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.299
 RÃ¶sler sees in Germany's defense apart the hosts see use 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.299
 and are so bad off 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.719
 and Andreas Bergmann 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.890
 has still refurbished and new staff for the still possible compensates he brings 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.599
 now bring a building reserve forward 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.179
 nobody will have the exclusion of Adamu and Temarii dismissed de MaiziÃ¨re 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:58.489
 CDU is only two seasons victories each to ensure 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.659
 Berlin 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.659
 and Bochum to 1 in Germany where they stand 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.669
 As the CEO you are with your head up and your eyes open for 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.669
 the courses were checked out 1 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.340
 the man for a few minutes 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.590
 Daniel Ginczek came on nine minutes earlier with the 3 3 second 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.900
 and the fortunes 1 Andreas Bergmann did everything right 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.620
 The final phase in Germany struggles massively from the game operation 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 totally unsettled high above the sea 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.800
 Daniel Dietsche 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.920
 a top said too late with Chong Tese this area the software 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.919
 are not stopping John Cleese 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.919
 Guide turned the game 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.379
 Blazevic favors Giesecke calls CERN again conjures up mistakes 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.379
 and again a late win for Bergmann and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 is not final 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.400
 but in Germany is done absolutely Ladies Golf makes the track free 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.319
 for Daniel Gintschel 20 years young 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.370
 and quite cool over to Reno Reply to five a spectacle 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.800
 Zeeb knows who he had to thank for walking here 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.650
 Substitutes 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.379
 maybe even better 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.959
 and there is Wasserburg
