00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
pieces which I'll talk about a little

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.200 
pieces which I'll talk about a little
later<00:01:05.199> on<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.580> then<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.790> players<00:01:07.030> will

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
finish putting out all the other ones

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.250 
finish putting out all the other ones
one<00:01:08.770> at<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:08.980> time<00:01:09.130> back<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.640> forth<00:01:10.050> once<00:01:11.050> that's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
one at a time back and forth once that's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.590 
one at a time back and forth once that's
done<00:01:11.530> then<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.070> player<00:01:12.760> will<00:01:13.030> start<00:01:13.300> so<00:01:13.450> we'll

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
done then a player will start so we'll

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.330 
done then a player will start so we'll
say<00:01:13.780> white<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.500> going<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.800> be<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.040> start

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
say white is going to be the start

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.760 
say white is going to be the start
player<00:01:15.580> here<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.510> on<00:01:16.960> your<00:01:17.170> turn<00:01:17.380> what<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.650> do

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
player here and on your turn what you do

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.410 
player here and on your turn what you do
is<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:17.979> take<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.189> piece<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.759> move<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.329> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
is you take a piece and you move it in a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.789 
is you take a piece and you move it in a
straight<00:01:19.780> line<00:01:19.810> as<00:01:20.729> far<00:01:21.729> as<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:23.140> height<00:01:23.500> of

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
straight line as far as the height of

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.340 
straight line as far as the height of
the<00:01:23.979> stack<00:01:24.340> which<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.479> case<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.869> single

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
the stack which in this case is a single

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.429 
the stack which in this case is a single
piece<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:27.150> stack<00:01:28.150> belongs<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.200> player

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
piece a stack belongs to the player

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.190 
piece a stack belongs to the player
whose<00:01:29.829> piece<00:01:30.759> is<00:01:31.000> on<00:01:31.180> top<00:01:31.540> okay<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:31.960> this

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
whose piece is on top okay so this

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.780 
whose piece is on top okay so this
player<00:01:32.470> could<00:01:32.680> for<00:01:32.860> example<00:01:32.890> take<00:01:33.399> this<00:01:33.549> piece

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
player could for example take this piece

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.600 
player could for example take this piece
move<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.329> straight<00:01:34.570> line<00:01:34.600> ones<00:01:35.610> like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
move it in a straight line ones like

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.550 
move it in a straight line ones like
that<00:01:36.880> next<00:01:37.390> time<00:01:37.540> this<00:01:37.720> piece<00:01:37.930> moves<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.439> will

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
that next time this piece moves it will

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.950 
that next time this piece moves it will
have<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.920> move<00:01:39.070> twice<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.750> height

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
have to move twice because it's a height

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.410 
have to move twice because it's a height
of<00:01:40.990> two<00:01:41.380> another<00:01:42.340> rule<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.610> follow<00:01:42.939> is<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.270> a

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
of two another rule to follow is that a

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.889 
of two another rule to follow is that a
piece<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:44.430> legally<00:01:45.430> move<00:01:45.670> must<00:01:46.509> not<00:01:46.719> be

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
piece to legally move must not be

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.929 
piece to legally move must not be
trapped<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.590> what<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.040> means<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.729> piece

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
trapped and what that means is a piece

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.280 
trapped and what that means is a piece
that<00:01:48.969> is<00:01:49.240> trapped<00:01:49.689> is<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.899> piece<00:01:50.079> that<00:01:50.110> is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
that is trapped is a piece that is

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.139 
that is trapped is a piece that is
completely<00:01:50.829> surrounded<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> piece<00:01:51.880> for

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
completely surrounded this piece for

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.660 
completely surrounded this piece for
instance<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.750> trapped<00:01:53.530> everything<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.579> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
instance is trapped everything on the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.649 
instance is trapped everything on the
border<00:01:55.030> right<00:01:55.180> now<00:01:55.240> not<00:01:55.869> trapped<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.939> on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
border right now not trapped and so on

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.910 
border right now not trapped and so on
your<00:01:58.840> turn<00:01:58.990> you're<00:01:59.140> going<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.320> do<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.560> let's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
your turn you're going to do that let's

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.679 
your turn you're going to do that let's
say<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.219> then<00:02:00.310> black<00:02:00.610> would<00:02:00.820> move<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.420> piece

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
say and then black would move this piece

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.830 
say and then black would move this piece
has<00:02:01.899> just<00:02:02.079> become<00:02:02.200> unwrapped<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.570> they<00:02:04.689> could

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
has just become unwrapped so they could

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.830 
has just become unwrapped so they could
do<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.229> once<00:02:05.649> let's<00:02:06.610> say<00:02:06.789> Y<00:02:07.060> will<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:07.570> move

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
do that once let's say Y will now move

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.749 
do that once let's say Y will now move
one<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.110> these<00:02:08.229> pieces<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.340> if

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
one of these pieces here for one if

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.090 
one of these pieces here for one if
black<00:02:10.600> wanted<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.140> move<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.470> piece<00:02:11.740> they<00:02:11.920> can

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
black wanted to move this piece they can

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.370 
black wanted to move this piece they can
move<00:02:12.160> III<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.570> move<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.050> three<00:02:14.260> they

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
move III have to move it three they

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.140 
move III have to move it three they
could<00:02:14.530> jump<00:02:14.710> over<00:02:14.830> empty<00:02:15.310> spaces<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.030> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
could jump over empty spaces but you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.330 
could jump over empty spaces but you
cannot<00:02:16.420> end<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:16.960> an<00:02:17.050> empty<00:02:17.350> space<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.250> they

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
cannot end in an empty space so they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.690 
cannot end in an empty space so they
could<00:02:18.490> do<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:18.760> two<00:02:19.000> three<00:02:19.540> let's<00:02:19.720> say<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.700> so

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
could do one two three let's say and so

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.820 
could do one two three let's say and so
on<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.030> continue<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.870> basically

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
on you continue to do that basically

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.970 
on you continue to do that basically
eating<00:02:24.310> other<00:02:24.580> pieces<00:02:24.879> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
eating other pieces and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.070 
eating other pieces and
at<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.190> end<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> game<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.750> going<00:02:28.959> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
at the end of the game you're going to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410 
at the end of the game you're going to
grab<00:02:29.319> all<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:29.830> stacks<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.819> board<00:02:31.060> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
grab all your stacks on the board and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.149 
grab all your stacks on the board and
you're<00:02:31.870> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.290> stack<00:02:32.709> them<00:02:32.739> up<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.010> top<00:02:33.129> of

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
you're going to stack them up on top of

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.140 
you're going to stack them up on top of
each<00:02:33.310> other<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.640> whoever<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.030> highest

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
each other and whoever has the highest

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
each other and whoever has the highest
stack<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.290> pieces<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.370> winner<00:02:36.580> however

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
stack of pieces is the winner however

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.410 
stack of pieces is the winner however
during<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.459> game<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.120> extremely

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
during the game you have to be extremely

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.690 
during the game you have to be extremely
cautious<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.319> these<00:02:41.620> three<00:02:41.950> red<00:02:42.159> pieces

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
cautious because these three red pieces

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.800 
cautious because these three red pieces
these<00:02:43.569> life<00:02:44.049> pieces<00:02:44.620> are<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:46.000> key<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.629> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
these life pieces are the key to the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.410 
these life pieces are the key to the
game<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.319> key<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.739> keeping<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:49.120> pieces

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
game and the key to keeping your pieces

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.000 
game and the key to keeping your pieces
on<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.989> board<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.640> at<00:02:51.640> any<00:02:51.790> point<00:02:51.879> any<00:02:53.010> piece

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
on the board if at any point any piece

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.600 
on the board if at any point any piece
of<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.519> board<00:02:54.760> becomes<00:02:55.150> disconnected<00:02:55.870> from

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
of the board becomes disconnected from

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.039 
of the board becomes disconnected from
one<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.730> those<00:02:57.879> or<00:02:58.209> all<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.510> them<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.840> should<00:02:58.870> say

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
one of those or all of them I should say

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.900 
one of those or all of them I should say
basically<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.799> not<00:02:59.980> touching<00:03:00.160> any<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.640> them

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
basically it's not touching any of them

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.839 
basically it's not touching any of them
then<00:03:01.120> those<00:03:01.860> pawns<00:03:02.860> are<00:03:03.099> going<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.370> removed

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
then those pawns are going to be removed

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.869 
then those pawns are going to be removed
from<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.510> board<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.980> example<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.609> moves

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
from the board so for example this moves

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.220 
from the board so for example this moves
here<00:03:07.379> let's<00:03:08.379> say<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:09.670> piece<00:03:10.000> moves<00:03:10.329> here<00:03:11.079> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
here let's say this piece moves here and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.039 
here let's say this piece moves here and
then<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:13.290> blacks<00:03:14.290> turn<00:03:15.599> they<00:03:16.599> would<00:03:16.840> do

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
then on blacks turn they would do

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.599 
then on blacks turn they would do
something<00:03:17.379> like<00:03:17.739> this<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.280> would<00:03:18.400> move

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
something like this they would move

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.720 
something like this they would move
twice<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.810> way<00:03:20.019> bloom<00:03:20.260> bolt<00:03:20.500> these<00:03:21.370> pieces

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
twice this way bloom bolt these pieces

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.550 
twice this way bloom bolt these pieces
have<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.359> become<00:03:22.660> disconnected<00:03:23.230> from

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
have just become disconnected from

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.890 
have just become disconnected from
everything<00:03:23.829> that's<00:03:24.400> red<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.849> they<00:03:25.540> would<00:03:25.690> be

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
everything that's red and they would be

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.780 
everything that's red and they would be
completely<00:03:26.859> removed<00:03:27.390> from<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.930> board<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.790> so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
completely removed from the board and so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.430 
completely removed from the board and so
you<00:03:30.849> have<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> be<00:03:31.269> very<00:03:31.540> mindful<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.169> those

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
you have to be very mindful of those

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.710 
you have to be very mindful of those
three<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:33.340> could<00:03:33.459> even<00:03:33.910> incorporate<00:03:34.540> them

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
three you could even incorporate them

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.839 
three you could even incorporate them
into<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.200> stack<00:03:35.590> black<00:03:36.040> could<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.459> something

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
into a stack black could do something

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.370 
into a stack black could do something
like<00:03:36.880> this<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.450> now<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.750> red<00:03:37.959> piece<00:03:38.169> is

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
like this and now that red piece is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.990 
like this and now that red piece is
always<00:03:38.590> connected<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.130> least<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.579> stack

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
always connected to at least that stack

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.170 
always connected to at least that stack
and<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.560> stack<00:03:41.560> being<00:03:41.799> mobile<00:03:42.280> well<00:03:42.970> that's

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and that stack being mobile well that's

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.789 
and that stack being mobile well that's
an<00:03:43.299> interesting<00:03:43.480> proposition<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.609> to

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
an interesting proposition you have to

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.220 
an interesting proposition you have to
be<00:03:47.799> aware<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.250> once<00:03:48.489> stacks<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:49.230> fairly

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
be aware that once stacks get fairly

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.319 
be aware that once stacks get fairly
large<00:03:50.430> they<00:03:51.430> pretty<00:03:51.639> much<00:03:51.790> can't<00:03:52.090> move

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
large they pretty much can't move

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.759 
large they pretty much can't move
anymore<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.109> they<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.440> be<00:03:53.560> very

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
anymore and so they have to be very

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.680 
anymore and so they have to be very
careful<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.489> don't<00:03:55.269> have<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.389> single

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
careful that you don't have a single

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.550 
careful that you don't have a single
piece<00:03:55.959> that's<00:03:56.709> huge<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:57.849> not<00:03:57.880> very<00:03:58.209> mobile

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
piece that's huge but not very mobile

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.900 
piece that's huge but not very mobile
and<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.709> it's<00:03:59.859> basically<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.669> game

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
and so it's basically that's the game

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.890 
and so it's basically that's the game
you're<00:04:01.030> going<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.180> continue<00:04:01.419> doing<00:04:01.810> that

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
why then I'm just gonna fake it here

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.780 
why then I'm just gonna fake it here
let's<00:04:14.169> say<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:14.500> what's<00:04:14.680> left<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.639> would

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
compare these two side-by-side this is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.930

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
caveat for me which is I think the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.020 
caveat for me which is I think the
set-up<00:04:37.960> time<00:04:38.320> which<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.219> did<00:04:39.400> not<00:04:39.550> show<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:39.849> in

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
set-up time which I did not show you in

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.320 
set-up time which I did not show you in
the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.189 
the
you<00:04:40.419> is<00:04:40.629> a<00:04:40.689> little<00:04:41.620> long<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.449> I<00:04:43.449> wish<00:04:43.990> there

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
you is a little long and I wish there

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.230 
you is a little long and I wish there
was<00:04:44.319> a<00:04:44.379> better<00:04:44.710> way<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.069> get<00:04:45.310> playing<00:04:45.610> quicker

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
was a better way to get playing quicker

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.260 
was a better way to get playing quicker
now<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.199> could<00:04:47.500> just<00:04:48.250> put<00:04:48.849> all<00:04:48.939> the<00:04:49.090> pieces

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
now you could just put all the pieces

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.089 
now you could just put all the pieces
out<00:04:49.509> there<00:04:49.569> randomly<00:04:50.229> and<00:04:50.379> start<00:04:50.830> playing

out there randomly and start playing
right<00:04:51.189> away<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:51.939> you're<00:04:52.509> technically

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
right away but you're technically

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.249 
right away but you're technically
supposed<00:04:53.439> to<00:04:53.759> take<00:04:54.759> your<00:04:55.060> turns<00:04:55.330> putting<00:04:56.020> out

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259

a piece on the board one at a time and
it<00:04:58.270> takes<00:04:58.479> a<00:04:58.599> little<00:04:58.719> long<00:04:59.050> for<00:04:59.409> my<00:05:00.400> taste<00:05:00.699> but

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it takes a little long for my taste but
