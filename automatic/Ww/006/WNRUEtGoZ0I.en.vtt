00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.910
 today I will explain a curiosity that 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.979
 very few people know something really 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.969
 I miss that we have never considered 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:15.179
 why the sand of the sea that is 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.699
 in contact with sea water is more 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.000
 dark that the sand that is not in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.000
 contact with sea water what happens that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.380
 the water changes its color 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 Have you ever wondered why? 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 reason all that sand that is wet is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.740
 looks much darker than the sand that no 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.820
 it is that the sand that is dry 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.340
 well, all this has a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 explanation is not that the sand mute not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 is that the sand change its composition what 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.190
 only thing that changes is the way in which 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 are projected good is reflected 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.850
 refract the rays of light this is the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.610
 called dispersion phenomenon 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 basically on the sand reaches a A 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.860
 of light rays and when it gets there and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.460
 makes contact with the sand in the case of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.080
 that this thin film of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 sea water 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 to the sand as it catches more rays of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 with which it becomes much more 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.070
 dark while if the sand is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 dry directly arrives and bounces that's 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 what makes it look much clearer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.280
 with which you already know because the sand is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.490
 darker or lighter so only 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.130
 depends on how the light is refracted 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.440
 how the light finally arrives after all 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 reality does not change is to say the sand does not 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.090
 it's different because it's one color 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.640
 different in reality all things are 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 same regardless of the color the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.750
 color is something that we are capable of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 distinguish human beings using 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.910
 sunlight but that a thing is of a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.369
 color or another does not change anything the only 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.770
 which indicates is the way in which 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.010
 reflect the rays of light in that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010
 surface
