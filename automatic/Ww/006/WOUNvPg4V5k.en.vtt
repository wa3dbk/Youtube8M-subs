new<00:00:11.460> curricula<00:00:11.969> system

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
new curricula system

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.289 
new curricula system
I<00:00:12.630> wanted<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> buy<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> more<00:00:14.400> quickly<00:00:14.580> systems

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
I wanted to buy to more quickly systems

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
I wanted to buy to more quickly systems
so<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.960> use<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> same<00:00:16.529> plates<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.310> my

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
so I can use the same plates for all my

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.700 
so I can use the same plates for all my
different<00:00:17.730> work<00:00:18.090> tools<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.990> had<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> hard<00:00:19.470> time

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
different work tools but had a hard time

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.550 
different work tools but had a hard time
to<00:00:20.039> find<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> take<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
to find out which one to take in this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
to find out which one to take in this
video<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.160> will<00:00:23.220> show<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.550> whether<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.240> old

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

quick-release system of an front row but

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
quick-release system of an front row but
you<00:00:26.789> slide<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.449> plate<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> back<00:00:28.380> is

compatible<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> new<00:00:29.880> system<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
compatible with the new system where you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
compatible with the new system where you
drop<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.500> from<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.890> top<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.669> old<00:00:32.880> system

drops in I can lock it end at 6 but

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
drops in I can lock it end at 6 but
let's<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> safety<00:01:27.270> features<00:01:27.659> work

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
let's see how the safety features work

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.649 
let's see how the safety features work
let's<00:01:28.710> imagine<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.430> drop<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.180> forgot

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
let's imagine you drop it in and forgot

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.130 
let's imagine you drop it in and forgot
to<00:01:30.780> lock<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to lock it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.980 
to lock it
usually<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> no<00:01:32.610> problem<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.750> blade

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
usually this is no problem the blade

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
usually this is no problem the blade
will<00:01:34.200> slide<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> front<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.400> but

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
will slide to the front or back but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.870 
will slide to the front or back but
won't<00:01:35.970> fall<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:37.020> since<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> 5:01<00:01:38.100> PL<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
won't fall out but since the 5:01 PL is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
won't fall out but since the 5:01 PL is
quite<00:01:39.119> short<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.810> exit<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.229> safety<00:01:40.710> bar

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
quite short it will exit the safety bar

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
quite short it will exit the safety bar
and<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.610> fall<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.119> from<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> top<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and can now fall out from the top this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
and can now fall out from the top this
might<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.950> example<00:01:43.979> happen<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> carry
