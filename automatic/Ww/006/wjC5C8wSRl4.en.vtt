00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
regular mode during the day and then

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
regular mode during the day and then

when<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.860> dark<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.119> using

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
when it's dark out because I think using

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
when it's dark out because I think using
night<00:01:09.869> mode<00:01:10.110> during<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> day<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.430> out

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
night mode during the day you know out

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
night mode during the day you know out
and<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.479> if<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> sunny

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and about like you know if it's a sunny

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
and about like you know if it's a sunny
day<00:01:13.380> it'll<00:01:14.189> probably<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:14.880> hard<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> see

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
day it'll probably be pretty hard to see

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.020 
day it'll probably be pretty hard to see
you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> Sun<00:01:17.460> glaring<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.909> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you know with the Sun glaring on it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.219 
you know with the Sun glaring on it
whatever<00:01:18.180> being<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.630> night<00:01:18.720> mode<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
whatever being in night mode is it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.660 
whatever being in night mode is it
probably<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.740> hard<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.159> eyes<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
probably pretty hard on your eyes I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.800 
probably pretty hard on your eyes I
would<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> being<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
would think that you know it being in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570 
would think that you know it being in
regular<00:01:22.110> mode<00:01:22.290> would<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.409> easier<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
regular mode would be easier but it's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.890 
regular mode would be easier but it's
totally<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.180> however<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
totally up to you however you want to

here<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.320> order<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> night<00:01:35.310> mode<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
here in order for the night mode to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.039 
here in order for the night mode to
chain<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.450> effect<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> an

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
chain you know take effect in an

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
chain you know take effect in an
application<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.680> application<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> be

application the application has to be

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
application the application has to be
killed<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:40.049> allow<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
night mode you don't have to kill them

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.880 
night mode you don't have to kill them
manually<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.409> cool<00:01:52.500> feature

the<00:03:02.550> different<00:03:02.819> sections<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.260> now<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.680> we

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
the different sections do so now here we

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.259 
the different sections do so now here we
go<00:03:04.920> into<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.250> per<00:03:05.430> application<00:03:06.060> settings

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
go into the per application settings

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.550 
go into the per application settings
this<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.569> where<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.050> basically<00:03:07.200> adjust

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
this is where you can basically adjust

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.770 
this is where you can basically adjust
night<00:03:07.980> mode<00:03:08.160> for<00:03:08.670> every<00:03:09.030> application

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
night mode for every application

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.330 
night mode for every application
individually<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.769> gonna<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.010> something

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
individually this is gonna be something

for you guys to play around with to get

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.740 
for you guys to play around with to get
your<00:03:13.980> applications<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.150> way<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.330> want<00:03:15.600> them

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
your applications the way you want them

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
your applications the way you want them
to<00:03:15.810> look<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.040> everybody<00:03:17.610> has<00:03:17.760> different

to look you know everybody has different

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.550 
to look you know everybody has different
apps<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.450> their<00:03:18.570> devices<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.290> said<00:03:19.470> this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
apps on their devices like I said this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.650 
apps on their devices like I said this
is<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.890> something<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.510> mess<00:03:21.510> around

is just something for you to mess around
with<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.140> get<00:03:22.290> applications<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.850> to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
with to get applications you know to

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.550 
with to get applications you know to
work<00:03:24.150> specifically<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> way<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.110> want<00:03:25.380> them

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560

work specifically the way you want them
to<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.850> some<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.420> applications

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
to and with some of the applications

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.840 
to and with some of the applications
night<00:03:28.290> mode<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.739> doesn't<00:03:29.190> look<00:03:29.370> good

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
night mode just doesn't look good

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.340 
night mode just doesn't look good
I've<00:03:30.209> kind<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> messed<00:03:30.690> around<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.110> couple

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
I've kind of messed around with a couple

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.509 
I've kind of messed around with a couple
of<00:03:31.410> me<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:31.860> can't<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:32.250> them<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.489> way

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
of me you just can't get them the way

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.759 
of me you just can't get them the way
you<00:03:33.239> know<00:03:33.360> they<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:34.079> look<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you know they just don't look right and

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.620 
you know they just don't look right and
what's<00:03:35.670> cool<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.209> basically<00:03:36.390> just

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
what's cool is you can basically just

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.990 
what's cool is you can basically just
disable<00:03:37.500> night<00:03:37.680> mode<00:03:37.890> for<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.280> application

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
disable night mode for that application

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.850 
disable night mode for that application
specifically<00:03:39.570> which<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:40.049> really<00:03:40.590> do<00:03:40.680> like

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
specifically which I really do like

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.830 
specifically which I really do like
about<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.250> tweak<00:03:41.459> that's<00:03:41.579> really<00:03:41.880> cool<00:03:42.090> so

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
about this tweak that's really cool so

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.180 
about this tweak that's really cool so
let's<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.140> go<00:03:43.260> ahead<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.530> select<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.070> random

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
let's just go ahead and select a random

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.650 
let's just go ahead and select a random
application<00:03:44.850> I'll<00:03:44.970> show<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> different

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
application I'll show you the different

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900 
application I'll show you the different
settings<00:03:46.590> within<00:03:46.769> per<00:03:47.130> application<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.790> can

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
settings within per application you can

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.420 
settings within per application you can
change<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.900> have<00:03:48.959> no<00:03:49.140> cell<00:03:49.470> images<00:03:49.950> force

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
change you have no cell images force

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
change you have no cell images force
darker<00:03:50.850> status<00:03:51.239> bar<00:03:51.450> bled<00:03:52.140> as<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.440> see

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
darker status bar bled as you can see

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.520 
darker status bar bled as you can see
toggle<00:03:52.950> night<00:03:53.100> mode<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:54.630> course<00:03:55.049> settings

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
toggle night mode is is course settings

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.009 
toggle night mode is is course settings
so<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.489> course<00:03:56.760> settings<00:03:57.060> also<00:03:57.750> you

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
so this is the course settings also you

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.440 
so this is the course settings also you
do<00:03:58.109> have<00:03:58.230> experimental<00:03:58.859> settings<00:03:59.459> you<00:04:00.299> can

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
do have experimental settings you can

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.810 
do have experimental settings you can
colorize<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.230> UI<00:04:01.470> views<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.220> extra

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
colorize the UI views you have extra

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.030 
colorize the UI views you have extra
cell<00:04:03.060> colorization<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.650> remove

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
cell colorization you can remove

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.620 
cell colorization you can remove
background<00:04:05.400> images<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.299> then<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.420> have

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
background images and then you have

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.560 
background images and then you have
automatic<00:04:07.560> color<00:04:07.829> replace<00:04:08.549> now<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.359> said

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
automatic color replace now like I said

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.030 
automatic color replace now like I said
this<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.900> stuff<00:04:10.109> I'll<00:04:10.320> let<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.590> guys<00:04:10.769> tie

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
this is stuff I'll let you guys tie

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.130 
this is stuff I'll let you guys tie
around<00:04:11.190> with<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.420> know<00:04:12.540> mess<00:04:12.750> around<00:04:12.900> with

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
around with to you know mess around with

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.539 
around with to you know mess around with
the<00:04:13.260> different<00:04:13.530> applications<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:14.310> kind

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
the different applications they all kind

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.250 
the different applications they all kind
of<00:04:14.609> have<00:04:14.760> different<00:04:15.150> effect<00:04:15.450> depending<00:04:16.169> on

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
of have different effect depending on

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.080 
of have different effect depending on
the<00:04:16.320> application<00:04:16.890> all<00:04:17.130> apps<00:04:17.430> are<00:04:17.640> different

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the application all apps are different

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.390 
the application all apps are different
unfortunately<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:20.220> bit

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
unfortunately so it is a little bit

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.210 
unfortunately so it is a little bit
confusing<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.940> use<00:04:21.239> these<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.070> go

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
confusing to use these so we can go

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.620 
confusing to use these so we can go
ahead<00:04:23.310> we<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.520> exit<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.060> settings<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.450> want

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
ahead we can exit the settings I want

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.000 
ahead we can exit the settings I want
you<00:04:24.690> guys<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.870> check<00:04:25.020> out<00:04:25.289> what<00:04:25.500> some<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.950> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
you guys to check out what some of the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.379 
you guys to check out what some of the
applications<00:04:26.550> look<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:26.880> running<00:04:27.240> in

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
applications look like running in

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.839 
applications look like running in
mode<00:04:27.659> and<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.199> think<00:04:28.439> first<00:04:28.710> off<00:04:28.889> messages

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
mode and I think first off messages

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.010 
mode and I think first off messages
looks<00:04:30.090> really<00:04:30.449> really<00:04:30.629> cool

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
looks really really cool

let's<00:05:15.300> go<00:05:15.419> into<00:05:15.569> an<00:05:15.659> application<00:05:15.960> in<00:05:16.319> which<00:05:16.439> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
let's go into an application in which I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.080 
let's go into an application in which I
think<00:05:16.650> night<00:05:17.099> mode<00:05:17.310> should<00:05:17.490> be<00:05:17.610> disabled

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
think night mode should be disabled

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.240 
think night mode should be disabled
because<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.360> don't<00:05:18.659> think<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:18.990> looks<00:05:19.110> good<00:05:19.409> one

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
because I don't think it looks good one

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.939 
because I don't think it looks good one
is<00:05:20.490> Spotify<00:05:21.029> I<00:05:21.379> just<00:05:22.379> don't<00:05:22.560> think<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.830> looks

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
is Spotify I just don't think it looks

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.730 
is Spotify I just don't think it looks
good<00:05:23.159> and<00:05:23.339> Spotify<00:05:23.819> Spotify<00:05:24.719> natively<00:05:25.409> has<00:05:25.710> a

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
good and Spotify Spotify natively has a

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.980 
good and Spotify Spotify natively has a
dark<00:05:26.129> UI<00:05:26.400> anyway<00:05:26.969> so<00:05:27.029> this<00:05:27.389> is<00:05:27.569> something<00:05:27.870> I

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
dark UI anyway so this is something I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.290 
dark UI anyway so this is something I
would<00:05:28.050> disable<00:05:28.439> it<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.830> just<00:05:29.759> because<00:05:29.819> like<00:05:30.180> I

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
would disable it in just because like I

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.050 
would disable it in just because like I
said<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.509> don't<00:05:30.870> think<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.259> looks<00:05:31.379> very<00:05:31.529> good

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
said I don't think it looks very good

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.240 
said I don't think it looks very good
just<00:05:33.060> my<00:05:33.210> opinion<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.860> this<00:05:35.009> is<00:05:35.129> an

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
just my opinion so this is an

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.769 
just my opinion so this is an
application<00:05:35.400> out<00:05:35.849> with<00:05:36.000> disabled<00:05:36.449> night<00:05:36.599> mode

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
there we go they're changed so this is

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.420 
there we go they're changed so this is
what<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.960> music<00:05:55.110> application<00:05:55.469> looks<00:05:56.039> looks

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
what the music application looks looks

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.459 
what the music application looks looks
like<00:05:56.520> in<00:05:56.909> night<00:05:57.180> mode<00:05:57.389> I'm<00:05:57.599> not<00:05:57.750> sure<00:05:57.930> why<00:05:58.169> I

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
like in night mode I'm not sure why I

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.490 
like in night mode I'm not sure why I
have<00:05:58.889> all<00:05:59.129> these<00:05:59.339> random<00:06:00.020> songs<00:06:01.020> in<00:06:01.289> here<00:06:01.439> I

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
have all these random songs in here I

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.050 
have all these random songs in here I
think<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:01.770> has<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.009> do<00:06:02.129> with<00:06:02.159> when<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.550> synced<00:06:02.969> it

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
think it has to do with when I synced it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.570 
think it has to do with when I synced it
up<00:06:03.149> on<00:06:03.270> my<00:06:03.389> iTunes<00:06:03.719> the<00:06:03.870> other<00:06:04.020> day<00:06:04.430> let's<00:06:05.430> see
