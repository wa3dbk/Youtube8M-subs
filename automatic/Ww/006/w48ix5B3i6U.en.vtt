00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 we are here for the first interview 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 with the honorable President of the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.689
 republic but without editing my son my 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 Yours and of late also for the whole nation. 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.390
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.670
 super pretty good without the president seems 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.369
 that the country is losing the war for 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 inflation and true to war won already is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.150
 as well 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.800
 I 'll give you the solution first hand. 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.070
 that our team will adopt from 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.360
 From now on we will stop measuring the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 price index 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 Stopping at me he said to climb 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 then the problem solved but 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 President, this makes sense. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 sense as our last 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.520
 provisional measure determining that the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.110
 houses are all painted green for 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.090
 an ecological issue nÃ© president o 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.650
 last year there were many 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.339
 manifestations 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.600
 demonstrating population dissatisfaction 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.110
 including the people have been demanding enough 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 of the low value of the minimum wage we already 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.840
 we think about it , we also realize that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 the word minimum wage causes great 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.570
 anguish in the people 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 so let's switch to maximum salary 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.240
 research shows that 95% of the population 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
 found the idea good or great 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.100
 as happened with the word favela 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.870
 we moved to the community and the population 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.170
 cup in our country 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.659

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
