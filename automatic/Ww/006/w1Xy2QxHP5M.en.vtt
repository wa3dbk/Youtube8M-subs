00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 good people here I bring you a new 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 video is about the time when 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.439
 I get the challenge of the camouflages of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 diamond in all rocket launchers only 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.509
 I was missing the fhj to get in gold and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.009
 this is the moment when I get the 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.349
 last challenge that I had running 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.869
 he knocks down ten controlled aircraft 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.759
 for humans is the one that cost me the most 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.860
 because I'm not used to that 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.840
 throw the tan and vtv and here the moment 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.440
 in which I get gold camouflage in the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 F 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 hj weapons mastery gets the mastery 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.469
 with main and secondary weapons for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 win the knife camouflage 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.260
 diamond combat I do not know why it says what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 of the combat knife but he did not have 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
 before you get mastery with weapons 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.050
 secondary I already have all the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.149
 secondary the primary unlock 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.359
 diamond camouflage of all 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.519
 rocket launcher and the running one with the fhj 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.010
 what I tell you is for me the most complicated 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.870
 because I almost never get the vt or the sni 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.129
 I like nothing there and it cost me a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 a lot of time for 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.120
 get this last gold good guys 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.900
 come on I'll show you the camouflages of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.900
 diamond rocket launchers 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.210
 and how I was a bit lazy 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.980
 make meat with these weapons the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.080
 true that I never use them 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.400
 I have no rocket launchers like 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.470
 secondary not only you use 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.850
 secondary the houses that I use then 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.500
 I show you here a little bit in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.270
 uptown so you can see how the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 true that they are super handsome here 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.220
 you have the wizard on screen are weapons 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.720
 very very empty are very large with 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.030
 that the diamond camouflage shines 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.920
 very much especially the cameras of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.180
 death the enemies are stunned and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 is that you are watching on the screen 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.050
 it is magician the truth that is very useful not what 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.180
 had used until I proposed 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.979
 raise it to gold and yes it's good to take it 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 to the back especially if you do not use 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.450
 ghost in case they throw you an egg see 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.790
 answer is also good for 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.710
 knock it down it's fine because over 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.690
 you win together of the 35 points because you do not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.330
 it's more you can kill enemies which is what 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.750
 good of this magician rocket launcher we are going to 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.150
 move now to fhj only knocks down 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.250
 aircraft this rocket launcher is the bad thing 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.899
 that has and on top as you have seen in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 the previous gameplay like in the moment 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.860
 what I get the golden camouflage this 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.780
 weapon only carries two missiles with what 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.850
 that topple a blog star 1 l 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.310
 complicated because you have to throw the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.780
 two missiles and after or kill yourself or that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.819
 they kill you if you do not throw it away or that some 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.290
 mate of yours 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.910
 you can knock it down that's just the bad 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.740
 should carry three missiles is a point 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.780
 negative of this weapon in addition to not 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.030
 you can kill enemies with her yes that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.220
 he is gorgeous with the camouflage of 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.470
 Super big super diamond I also hit 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 the emblem of your emblem looks 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 perfectly in the weapon with what 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.489
 It remains that is very handsome to me I like 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.550
 this weapon aesthetically is very very 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.940
 cool let's move on now to see the rpg 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.440
 this weapon that is undoubtedly the most 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.930
 print that can be removed because 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.700
 you can make low triple low doubles 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.590
 especially in game modes by 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.260
 objectives such as domain or 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.900
 demolition or barracks throw a rpg there 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.330
 the objective can be a double triple 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.230
 low many points is very beautiful 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.450
 also in his diamond camouflage this 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.250
 Super Vacilon weapon to the cameras of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.110
 death the enemies if we are blamed 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.209
 they only guarantee once the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.470
 sound to listen to them when I kill them 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.420
 and I make the death chamber at the end and 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.550
 they are amazed because the truth 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.370
 has a couple of challenges that are very very 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.380
 pimps the rpg very cool now we are going to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.970
 go to see them and nothing this man I like 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.430
 a lot we go forward is not so powerful 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.170
 as in other call of duty but it is very 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.819
 fearsome good guys let's see now 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.780
 how camouflages are unlocked and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.360
 terras some tips for 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.739
 get them 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.120
 the guys let's move on to see how it 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.550
 unlock the camouflages of these 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.700
 rocket launchers we start with the is magician 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.920
 as all at the beginning do destroy 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.230
 100 aircraft to get the iphone 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.959
 carbon fiber wolves make 10 casualties of 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.580
 direct impact suffering destroy 5 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.440
 aircraft in a game you have to 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.510
 destroy 5 eggs for example in a 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.489
 single game is not complicated art of the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.410
 war destroy kill an enemy 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.330
 shooting at a car or something that explodes 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.640
 that's also not complicated running five 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.069
 double losses neither complicated here not 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.260
 I scoff at the skull that is to destroy 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.670
 A fire dragon with him is a magician 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.350
 question of being lucky that some 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.510
 enemy I threw it to be parrot and 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.519
 knock it down is not very complicated is magician 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.950
 get it in gold let's pass the ph 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.600
 jota carbon fiber 10 aircraft nothing 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.450
 more take off or be nothing else that throws 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.330
 enemies destroy them suffering 5 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.520
 in an art game of war that 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.230
 it's destroyed sandbanks and I do not know how I 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.030
 they gave it practically I think that 's it 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.380
 knock down two aircraft and in one 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.630
 starting you get art of war yes 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.490
 destroys five having the suffering and 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.660
 then we go to running that running 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.880
 yes that is the crappy you wish that you have 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.830
 seen in it at the beginning of the video that 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.540
 is to destroy earth made of casualties of a 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.320
 human player is to say a new star a 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.610
 vtv l if you are lucky you are shooting vdv 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.620
 I hire them mind is very easy for me 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.330
 I swear it's hard for me 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.450
 take out vtv read what they are in a game 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.430
 then destroy the skull destroy a 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.800
 agr people you have to do two 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.060
 missions the 81 of the dance war of 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.980
 two missiles and destroy it because the 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.410
 truth that as soon as he sees you he kills you let's go 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.600
 to spend the rpg make 100 casualties with the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.190
 low carbon 10 low impact 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.890
 direct with the reverse is suffering that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.390
 is the prick with the f rpg destroy a 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.470
 aircraft I recommend you try it 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.300
 with a helicopter I get it 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.520
 helicopter because they are the lowest 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.710
 fly and it's easier to give the r &amp; b that 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.690
 has very very little precision art of 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.320
 war shoot a car and kill a 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.460
 enemy with the explosion running five 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.380
 double losses 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.120
 the most complicated of all without a doubt 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.150
 all rocket launchers make a triple 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.220
 low with rpg that as is not like all the 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.319
 world is thought with a single rpg do 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.669
 three casualties can be done with two but 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.340
 you have to do it very fast is to say 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.199
 do first one double or one simple and 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.639
 then a double I mean does not have 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.069
 why be with ones with a single missile 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.330
 can be with two attention i what 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.560
 I got it that way I thought it was 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.150
 only with one for that even though it was 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.280
 more complicated but if you do it 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.660
 quickly the only missiles you have 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.180
 lucky that one of the two impacts 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.009
 be double you get the camouflage of 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.960
 skulls and the corresponding gold of 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.750
 this weapon let's see now I'm going to 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.940
 teach the title that give you a title 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.070
 hidden they give when you get all 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.599
 the camouflage of the first ideas and 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.729
 of the secondary ones does not appear this 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.020
 title at the beginning they give it to you when 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.180
 come what have you have to go here to 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.729
 total mastery here you have master 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.130

 secondary school gets the mastery with 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.650
 all secondary weapons and here weapons 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.180
 mastery gets the mastery with weapons 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.560
 main and secondary to win the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.060
 combat blade camouflage 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.870
 diamond I do not know why he puts this the 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.310
 knife because I already have it 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.770

 you can see them and see how they 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.110
 unlock camouflages or 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.420
