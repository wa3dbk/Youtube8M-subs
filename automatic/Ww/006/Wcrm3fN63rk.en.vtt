00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.860
 mom all cases with this new video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.450
 of the piece of need 1 if need be 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 believe but usually everything in description 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.939
 milano even 8 percent more 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 of the credits from the moments commit the 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.300
 Our code in Syria reliable secure 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's fast 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 having said that we start with our le 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 our parts should be three in 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 this video takes this video as you know 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 I have uploaded one day and it will be public 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.030
 when you are seeing it then at the end 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.309
 you don't find the player in the video but 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 in the description so I tell you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 now you will find the end of the banner 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 up there they are saying what a beautiful set 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.129
 to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 the only issue was that dangerous 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.960
 balotelli so we are a little to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 who in fact scores obviously 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 balotelli that there is to say that in this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.540
 my game started and pato stopped 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 work and that is me first flying him 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.399
 he understood behind I pressed exchange 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.350
 external he understood dc in attack this 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.270
 case here as you see in the center 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.670
 practically chiellini was not there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.809
 practically balotelli was alone 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.090
 what you see seems to me then 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 should it be de rossi that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 it was he who had fallen back to defend 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 up to 10 but I don't tell you from and blasphemies 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.160
 to carry on this fucking 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.660
 match in the second said why not 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.459
 it has magically recovered has no more 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.750
 made with minchiate added facts 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.880
 that I have to change to give you some 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 patience we find this beautiful 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 Brazilian really dangerous because 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.289
 I was very offensive so I had a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.759
 bit of skype for the amount of 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.470
 strikers who contributed three 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 defenders more in ample for 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 luck to the tenth valbuena does this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 passage that is diverted but for 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.319
 luck comes balotelli that marks the one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.720
 at zero it obviously preaches calm 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.800
 because the game just started is 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.420
 in fact they should be thought 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.640
 would have been the cocks contrasts but of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.349
 this type but instead to the sixteenth 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.759
 place happens that even balotelli 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.690
 manages to take this short rebound 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.130
 is the puts on the net we are on the 2 to 0 first 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.530
 goal for the undersigned on soccer 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.179
 corner with a sense to him and say 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.429
 that even now but let's even go 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.599
 sixty-seventh where it is doubled 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.009
 what do you mean 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.250
 here evil smanaccia goalkeeper shore 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.679
 ask me bon gol 3 to 0 sixty-seventh 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.209
 cheerfully closed match waste uses 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.750
 It is this school that is locked 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.180
 selling 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.680
 created by fire also I inform you that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.540
 this division of this must damage 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.040
 still five because it is 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.750
 success the thing that we all don't 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.910
 we would wait because you will see the house of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 cross the center of the studied boom 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.470
 a cross at the center for the good cavani 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 who stuffs it with her head 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.230
 it happens from what we all don't want 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.700
 true our step brothers 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.260
 posters are placed in front of a game 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 that I don't know they start playing 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.340
 meaningless what happens to you 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 recedes they lose you a week 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.900
 work can be said as they are 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.340
 due I had to redo the division 5 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.290
 to trace division made after one 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 win a draw you don't have 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.950
 you will see why it would be a Trojan al 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 ninetieth in fact still paid marks 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.060
 with stop accordingly I have to 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.320
 restart and make this wine case 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.840
 and food and luckily you will succeed in doing 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.280
 the first attempt after I assure you 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.590
 several casinos with the truck and the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.540
 relative said that we are at the third 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.700
 game that I have another series to this one 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.200
 Once more badass because of tevez 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.910
 Christmas balotelli for how much you don't appreciate 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.540
 christmas but a tevez is a player 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.650
 underrated that he knows when I buy 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.410
 that before balotelli is much more 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 therefore strong in my water can not 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.860
 spend more time 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.690
 never say never here while cavani manages to 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.610
 take this wrong ball of the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.780
 opposing defense and marks the one to zero 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.310
 we are at the eighth of the first half that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.440
 stage of course without being too much 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.820
 because in the end a very lucky goal 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.860
 useless to celebrate big and many 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.299
 other cor of this type while mine 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.850
 test from the thirteenth uses 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.620
 I probably don't know the banking of 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.209
 these fucking shots with di 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.829
 Christmas that in s'inventa a goal for 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.180
 beautiful charity but whose really 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.560
 intrinsic skill of the player mi 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.470
 seems really hard to understand 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.209
 because attracted by the other side of the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.120
 field practically circled by his house 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.920
 and it came and I tell you that in the video it does not 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.250
 you see but at a certain point there is the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.540
 ball disappeared from reappearing so not 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.810
 I know how much he actually was 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.209
 good and how much the game danced anyway 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.690
 both to the forty-fifth must be said tevez 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.070
 doubles c then takes them on 2 to 1 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.130
 must know a good deed this 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.000
 time then black and defense 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.160
 but very obvious because here the sharaawy 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.980
 bo that is, you have it in front of you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.680
 forget but fortunately at 45 plus two 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.300
 you can say the good valbuena steals this 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.250
 inviting ball and for the first 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.570
 once in his life he made himself go away 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.410
 from the marking of the opposing defender 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.020
 and to admit bagging put in the sack the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.480
 ball for the final 2 2 the game 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.100
 obviously ends on 2 to 2 we are one 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.520
 win a draw for these first 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.900
 three games of division five i 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.310
 guys as usual I remember you there 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.560
 I repeat again soon you will see 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.930
 obviously the banner the player of 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.490
 this episode is not in the video in 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.050

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.350
 which of course will make you do some 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.030
 prize
