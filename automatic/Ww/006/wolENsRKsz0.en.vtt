00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.970
 when we talk about integration to nature means to take all your 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.939
 Benefits 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.219
 without affecting them 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.389
 one of the greatest benefits of nature is health 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 what plants can give for us 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
 we go an interview that we had with our friend Carlos Macaya 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.339
 in the studio in the city of mexico a few days ago 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.849
 and the zetas what speaks to us 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.079
 of these extraordinary possibilities 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.109
 of what natural medicine can do for us 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.530
 a few days ago I had the opportunity to meet and practice Mr. Carlos 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.900
 bacca who is a naturist counselor and I thought 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.680
 extraordinary 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 what I was exposed and I asked him to come this program 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.050
 so you can listen to it because you're probably going to be interested 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.800
 what are you going to say 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.440
 thank you very much to the rest of the guests who is a counselor 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.490
 naturists 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.980
 good is a person who teaches others to get healthy in shape 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.110
 natural 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.570
 that is, to use the tools that Mother Nature gives us to be 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.990
 healthy and not have to use foreign substances to our body 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 what they do is change their nature 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.820
 you have been doing for many years in this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.979
 naturismo fen species you went through the stores in ecuador the one that says that the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.520
 although there was a house 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.710
 there is even something more 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.549
 clear because we are not developing the creativity in which people believe 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.620
 in naturism 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.690
 but in a direct way in a way that felt in themselves the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.450
 Benefits 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.190
 and not through simple marketing that what I'm looking for is 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 make business 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.930
 not only that we seek is to help people improve their health in a 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.719
 natural 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.560
 we worry because people 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 he knows how to recover his health and puts it into practice, that's why we found a club 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.109
 naturist cost him 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.000

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 Health 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.180
 through tourism 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.670
 and then meet also for their extraordinary 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.679
 of the Mexican desert 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.720
 and a fascinating story yes indeed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 Thanks to Dr. Javier Apolinar Gómez who was a wonderful person 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.689
 he died at leisure is 92 at the age of 90 but he was a great 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.670
 botanist scientist and Mexican entrepreneur who studied precisely the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 deepest hair deraa of the sciences of our indigenous cultures 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.379
 very especially 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.420
 the Yaqui Indians the Huicholes in the seditious indigenous people of the northwest of the 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.779
 Mexican republic 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.939
 he studied a lot these people and from there he got 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.140
 a really extraordinary product 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.850
 a product that helps humanity to recover its health in a natural way 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.920
 because everything a totally different way begins by debugging 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.220
 internally so that we eliminate so many bitten substances that harm us 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.499
 inside the others themselves 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.269
 after stimulating we hold immunological sorry that it works a lot 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.079
 best 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.799
 and in this way it helps us to be healthy but because of the power of 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.689
 nature 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.909
 short valuable only that health selling from within our body does not 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.849
 from outside 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.530
 because true health comes from within our body health 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.730
 artificial is put on us but it is artificial only hard fear 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.160
 we are using the pill 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.709
 and that waist according to what you told me Carlos Tafur 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.529
 the right made with 7 and boils and seven seeds of the desert 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.169
 indeed precisely with the knowledge that the shamans gave him 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.559
 of the Yaqui tribes 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.300
 Dr. Javier Gómez learned how to make this mixture 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.940
 seven yards and seven miles from the sound desert that really has 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.509
 the powers marveled that to see what results he has given 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.929
 incredible jano truly power 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:49.219
 what happens is that people do not realize and our official medicine 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.200
 neither be it that the basic cause of diseases 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.990
 the dirt of the organism 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.260
 which is contaminated by saturated fats or toxic substances and by a 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.650
 junk we put to our port and that's why he's sick where 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.200
 we are that between an internal debugger something that gives us inside that we 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.980
 clean 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.519
 to help eliminate all the damage it does 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.170

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.680
