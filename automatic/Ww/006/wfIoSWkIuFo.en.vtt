00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.030 
so we found out George Bush was
certainly<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.720> interested<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.410> doing<00:02:00.890> any

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040

anything with me and who can blame him
I'm<00:02:02.720> barely<00:02:03.020> interested<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.560> hanging<00:02:03.710> around

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830
