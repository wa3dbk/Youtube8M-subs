00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.160
 reviews of games for android put a class under 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.929
 video and drove today's release will be 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 small and it will be 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 mostly from arcade 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 so the first game for today is called 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 doodle jump disi super heroes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 as you probably already understood it all 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570

 with all the major antagonists such 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 like penguin joker and others except 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.920
 the presence of the visual component 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.899
 original bosses game in principle 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.030
 no different from the original 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 jump to remember the old of course 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 great but still wanted to see at least 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 some innovations the second game 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 called van finale chaus in this game 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.399
 you have to play for an astronaut goal 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 which endlessly jump from an asteroid 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.960
 on the asteroid collect points avoid 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.500
 many obstacles and threatening your 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 of life 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.210
 control is carried out by two 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 buttons 1 allows you to change the direction 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.879
 movements and with the help of 2 you can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 jump 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.350
 visual plan, the game looks very 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 not bad and the gameplay is very dynamic and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.790
 from this detracting for the collected a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.340
 honors the word you can improve your 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 equipment next game is unusual 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.689
 puzzle called brain is ours 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.759
 the task of helping the robot go through 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.920
 room to open the door you need 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.930
 do some particular action 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 and what you have to guess yourself 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.790
 at first, everything will be obscenely simple 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 and elementary and then you will even 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.689
 wonder what you need to do 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.450
 to handle simple at first 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.340
 look at the problem further I want to talk about 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.040
 the game the main character of which is one of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.680
 characters of the popular league mobs legend 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.689
 a game called blitzcrank dispute rounds 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.149
 in this arcade we have to play for 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.040
 Blitzkranka goal of the game run forward and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.470
 you can also collect sheep 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.329
 nudge lagging sheep so they don't 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 fought off the herd beyond that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.770
 periodically you have to fight with 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.110
 bosses that will arise on your 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.360
 the way completes the game another puzzle 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.969
 more precisely a puzzle called club space 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.740
 here is your task from the available blocks 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.479
 collect well 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 well figure with this block you can 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.370
 rotate and move as you like 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.250
 at first the missions will be very elementary 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.020
 and teach you the very basics of the game 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.300
 but then the fun begins 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 where you will need to show all your 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.890
 ingenuity and logic on this to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
