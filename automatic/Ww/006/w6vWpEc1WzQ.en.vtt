but I kind of noticed it and I wanted to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.760 
but I kind of noticed it and I wanted to
see<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> works<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> couple<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
see if it works so I did it a couple of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
see if it works so I did it a couple of
times<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> realize<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.149> fact<00:00:36.180> does

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
times and realize that it in fact does

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.110 
times and realize that it in fact does
work<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:38.160> should<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.910> can

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
work now you should know that you can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150

basically go crazy and you know knock
some<00:00:43.800> shit<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.579> here's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> barrier

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
some shit down so like here's a barrier

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740 
some shit down so like here's a barrier
right<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.860> well<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> found<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right here well what I found out is the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.889 
right here well what I found out is the
further<00:00:49.110> away<00:00:49.469> he<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> barrier<00:00:51.539> when

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
further away he is from the barrier when

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.590 
further away he is from the barrier when
he<00:00:51.989> starts<00:00:52.350> running<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:54.000> points<00:00:54.390> you

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
he starts running the more points you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
he starts running the more points you
get<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.230> he<00:00:55.350> breaks<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.949> down<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.969> best

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
get when he breaks it down so the best

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560 
get when he breaks it down so the best
one<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:57.480> had<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.930> far<00:00:58.250> was<00:00:59.250> basically<00:01:00.180> from

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
one I've had so far was basically from

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
one I've had so far was basically from
inside<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> room<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.570> way

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
inside that room right there all the way

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
inside that room right there all the way
over<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> jug<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.100> he<00:01:05.189> broke<00:01:05.400> down<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
over to jug and when he broke down the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
over to jug and when he broke down the
jug<00:01:05.939> barrier<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.540> over<00:01:06.720> 2,000<00:01:07.500> points<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
jug barrier I got over 2,000 points for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
jug barrier I got over 2,000 points for
it<00:01:08.750> whereas<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.010> did<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.310> from

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it whereas the you know if I did it from

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
it whereas the you know if I did it from
like<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.880> I'd<00:01:11.970> only<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> couple

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like here I'd only get like a couple

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.590 
like here I'd only get like a couple
hundred<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.310> found<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.299> pretty

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
hundred so I found that to be pretty

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
hundred so I found that to be pretty
cool<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.430> them

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
cool the way you know when you have them

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
cool the way you know when you have them
break<00:01:17.700> something<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.119> try<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:18.900> as

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
break something down try and get them as

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.249 
break something down try and get them as
far<00:01:19.229> away<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:21.110> maximize<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
far away as you can and maximize the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
far away as you can and maximize the
amount<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.530> points<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.820> for

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
amount of points that you get also for

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.340 
amount of points that you get also for
those<00:01:24.180> who<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> knife

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
him and he'll run faster just for a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.030

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
for that barrier all the way over there

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
for that barrier all the way over there
and<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> careful<00:01:42.750> because

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and you got to be careful because

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.510 
and you got to be careful because
sometimes<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.950> he's<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.159> aimed

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sometimes you can if he's not aimed

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
sometimes you can if he's not aimed
correctly<00:01:45.409> he<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.970> run<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.240> something<00:01:48.450> else

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
correctly he can run into something else

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
correctly he can run into something else
he's<00:01:49.020> gonna<00:01:49.110> step<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> crawler<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.100> sure

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
he's gonna step on that crawler for sure

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
he's gonna step on that crawler for sure
but<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.840> 1,500

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
but as you can see i just got 1,500

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
but as you can see i just got 1,500
points<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.390> cool

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
points for that which is really cool

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.330 
points for that which is really cool
whereas<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.590> had<00:01:56.310> him

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
whereas if I would have just had him

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
whereas if I would have just had him
start<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.149> probably<00:01:57.509> only<00:01:57.840> would

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
start from here I probably only would

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.149 
start from here I probably only would
have<00:01:58.110> gotten<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.350> couple<00:01:58.439> hundred<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.040> i
