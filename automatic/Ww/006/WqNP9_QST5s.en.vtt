00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
should be interesting so let's pick my

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
should be interesting so let's pick my
vector<00:00:22.080> class<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.890> we're<00:00:23.519> jumping<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> right

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
vector class and we're jumping in right

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.029 
vector class and we're jumping in right
at<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> beginning<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:25.890> getting

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
at the beginning and we are getting

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.130 
at the beginning and we are getting
double<00:00:26.310> cab<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.939> mean<00:00:27.630> I'd<00:00:27.779> rather<00:00:27.960> be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
double cab so I mean I'd rather be

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.279 
double cab so I mean I'd rather be
getting<00:00:28.289> double<00:00:28.650> captain<00:00:28.920> triple<00:00:29.189> cap<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.289> we

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
getting double captain triple cap so we

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.770 
getting double captain triple cap so we
can<00:00:31.439> bring<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.679> back<00:00:31.920> easily<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> problem

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
can bring this back easily not a problem

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
can bring this back easily not a problem
seems<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:34.950> teammates<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> crosser

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
seems like my teammates got the crosser

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.030 
seems like my teammates got the crosser
be<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.200> should<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.680> able<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.950> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
should be able to get this plane I'm

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
should be able to get this plane I'm
just<00:00:49.950> gonna<00:00:50.070> lay<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.000> wait<00:00:51.090> for

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just gonna lay down here and wait for

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
just gonna lay down here and wait for
them<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> push<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.020> long<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.710> teammates
