00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.170
 events mortal kombat x develop 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.989
 25 years after our previous 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.970
 games many heroes get older though 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.400
 to which we announced on 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.500
 geimskom he looks aged and 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.300
 the amount of armor on the head has increased 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.190
 became more implants we also 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 there are new heroes like cassi 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.930
 cage daughters johnny cage and sony blade 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.120
 yes yes they got married and they have appeared 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.920
 child become part of the plot that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.810
 concerns innovation in gameplay this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 will be the fastest game not only in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.310
 series but among the fighting games in general and we 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.560
 delighted with this everything happens very 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.840
 quickly and smoothly, we saved 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.030
 that the players liked so much in the previous one 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 For example, the x-ray mode returns to the game. 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.320
 it's bigger and better has increased 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.840
 elaboration and detailing looks very 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.360
 beautiful if you ask me i will answer 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.620
 brutal but beautiful well and of course we are not 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.690
 forgot about fatalities 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.120
 it concerns the fact that we love mortal 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.830
 kombat talking about new items 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.840
 then we implemented the so-called 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 variations is something like style and 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.590
 reminds character customization in 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.600
 whichever you like 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.600
 play each character has three 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.090
 variations effects from them vary 1 can 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.280
 give amplification the other is focused 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.350
 on long-range attacks let's say if the opponent 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
 attacks near then you can hold it 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.210
 defended at a distance let's say 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.280
 sub-zero there is a variation unbreakable in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.870
 which he can create an ice sheet 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.300
 it helps in defense 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.000
 coming back to he has a lot of aimed 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.580
 dirty melee techniques he is very 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.649
 fast he has many counterattacks in the same 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.360
 time for each of the characters 10 base 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.220
 tricks here take a scorpion 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.890
 his harpoon he will be available to all 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.459
 variations at the same time will be unique 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.099
 receptions 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.050
 thanks to this you can pick one 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.390
 fighting style that suits you 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.730
 makes the gameplay more strategic that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.010
 still we did the environment she became still 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.290
 more developed and alive is felt 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.060
 interactivity, players will have a lot of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.210
 medium interaction options 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.610
 for example, you can tear off a branch from a tree 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.650
 and hold a blow with her help going to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 level they will already think how can I 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.370
 use the environment to win 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.590
 as for the secret characters not 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.600
 I can say that they will be secret but 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.920
 we will have a lot of characters that we 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 not yet announced 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.990
 you are waiting for surprises in general, dial 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.970
 patience keep ears on top of your nose 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.950
 down the wind you'll be glad 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 currently the number of characters 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.970
 not yet defined how to say so 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.700
 the quantity will be at the level of the previous one 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.500
 mortal kombat and injustice we usually have 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.540
 around twenty twenty four fighters 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.630
 in the game and this part will not be much 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.640
 Differ in this plan is a difficult balance 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.650
 and the important thing is fighting games you should always 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.180
 be attentive we are working on 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.550
 balance even those characters constantly 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.210
 which you have already seen we continue them 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.220
 modifying 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.930
 It is always difficult to adjust 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.250
 balance we invite testers 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.860
 professional gamers to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.720
 provide feedback it helps 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.580
 make a competitive element of the game 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.200
 more balanced so as not to be 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.360
 too powerful and strong characters 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.990
 to have fun balanced 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.220
 so that everyone can enjoy the game 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.200

 fashion and much more we treat 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.760
 this is extremely serious one of ours 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.160
 tasks make fast gameplay online 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.200
 we are doing everything we can at the moment 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.210
 we have already revealed 8 characters they 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 differ in technique 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.590
 I already mentioned to on he is taken very 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.990
 dirty and prefers melee 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.330
 dewara fighter insi who is on very 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.850
 fast but unique and unique 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.950
 insect poison attacks others 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.460
 characters of course scorpion is real 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.680
 classic 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.049
 the game for it is very smooth and we also 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.700
 There are new characters of the ether and then 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.620
 torus then a huge mighty fighter 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.990
 The scam is very small and sits on it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.840
 back she controls the torus as if he 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.610
 very brutal but slow with us 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.560
 a good selection of characters someone wants 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.480
 play for fast someone for very 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.670
 strong does anyone want to attack 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.650
 distance and we try to take it into account 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.300
 giving you the opportunity to play for who 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.100

 fighter mortal kombat x with us 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.530
 will not be so mode all due to the fact that we 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.810
 decided to concentrate on the new type 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.400
 gameplay in variations 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.139
 my favorite character because you are special 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.120
 asked this question now because 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.099
 very hard not to lie at the moment 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.870
 my favorite character is debora 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.789
 I think it is very interesting. 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.430
 the character I like her move with her 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.139
 cool x-ray attacks i think that she 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.870
 unique and different from the rest 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.280
 fighters I always preferred to play for 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 sub ziro but if you consider 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:16.250
