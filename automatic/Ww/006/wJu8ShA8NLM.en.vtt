 will show you a new map and that 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.290
 was launched online 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.970
 features of version 1.8 point 5 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.650
 that allows you to 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.070
 to skate but to make maneuvers 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.809
 everything else shelters on ramps 17 really 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.420
 had a skateboard inside the micro-bus 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.920
 boy this is cool the different rehearsal is 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.900
 very cool, very different even though 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.580
 wins in the water was the max has already shown 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.629
 several creations of it the channel of 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.729
 the voice of those who undoubtedly as 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.400
 also download the map if you 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.840
 want to download and play and that 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.760
 cool map because it has a circuit 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.619
 mec says fully functional lady 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.750
 which has me ramps mega ramp where so 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.150
 and also those with her that they want 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 You'll be happy there and the slide is 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.390
 You'll find that only in the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.280
 Iron , you walk and walk. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.320
 well cool, even he's all done in the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.180
 vanilla always mark the one of motorcycles enough 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 you put a run in mossul 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.579
 books he has several different 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.259
 features that already showed you 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.180
 now let's go next it first 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.920
 it was the following that you could happen 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.110
 William can attack him if you reach the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.670
 shift in the near he will pick up the hand more 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 boy you want to ride it neither is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.430
 very simple just click the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.770
 right from it and you assemble it is to recommend the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.090
 very cool time is recommended the use that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.650
 you always play third person because 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 in first person to play now 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.210
 You can not get a sense of what is 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.890
 happening because there is one of them because 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.270
 If you saw this man then I had to 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.920
 to change but to see some of the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.870
 maneuvers and see the movement of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.760
 more realistic and well-done maneuvers 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.680
 the goal of the Spanish title then tomato 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.810
 with a blue sweatshirt with that same outfit 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.280
 the younger we go to what matters is that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.870
 you can see here by hot barmak 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.180
 there are several color series 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.360
 different to steal some of them 1 blue 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.209
 and purple also another one in white one is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.099
 green and three are red and if the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.190
 chemistry determines which maneuvers 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.450
 you will do in different periods of 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.459
 opportunities here on the skateboard 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.069
 such as if you are walking 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.680
 normal near here in this place to do 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.239
 slide without even in northern Bahia amid 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.129
 Leave in the middle without any items you go 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.519
 to continue however the green cable passed 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.250
 here near and boys already brings there understood 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.470
 very cool then he selects the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.880
 maneuvers same thing for kieza than max 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.800
 4 that half purple blue 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 I do not know how right they have there 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.310
 the works that you can do with skateboard 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.990
 I'm going to give you an example of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.460
 A maneuver that I come here I'm going to give 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.870
 an example here dilma 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.030
 He could not complete her but he 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.800
 Let the skateboard of the one already tried to catch me. 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.200
 I do not know about this maneuver but finally a new one. 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.640
 of a maneuver cassette to make a 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.450
 new in simple people you have four 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160
 possibility of maneuvering 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.170
 each with its own difficulty. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.030
 really difficult levels you 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 you can see a video of the creator who 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.120
 everything else that shows the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.830
 difficulties also complicated 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.040
 so you have to do a sequence 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.030
 but with 432 1 234 to make a maneuver and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.980
 I'll make the first one that simply 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.870
 make a two three four simple 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.460
 I walk with skateboard look down goes 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.140
 make a peeling fall of that sector with 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.760
 a new one that I want to secure space and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.260
 When you have slips, I'll give you a 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.240
 new again, we can not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:34.960
 because of a think we a ray not 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.480
 forgot the time of day to 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.160
 another you amended the poll was good of 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.660
 time also has the ramp that marks 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.430
 well the time when I go through it I 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.690
 I 'll start walking faster if I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.060
 stay with the band will say yes to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.890
 none yet in another block each time 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.260
 higher with illegal sale 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.820
 now I think the lady who said that 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.250
 always wanted to learn with credibility 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.140
 I, too, have never had the ability of 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 seven smaller ones here you can also 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.290
 create your own course more 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.790
 one more maneuver because we have to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.710
 to take down what allows you to want these 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.240
 ramps and look how cool the course is 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.340
 You come here to jump here. 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.830
 I put it in the green and it 's fast there in the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.459
 I'll finish right after the mother and go 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.350
 though 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.170
 He saw the time was not a work of truth 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.730
 But I want to maneuver, I want to hold the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.870
 clue that ramp in my hand 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.630
 they raised their arms up 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.460
 balance the skateboard on my foot as it does not 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.390
 has how to do the same has is impossible 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.400
 so hi, the face you give me is 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.320
 Too many hours in the galera, remembering that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.720
 I said that the 34 goals are 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.910
 colors on the case and purples allowed you 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.530
 make maneuvers in case walking with skateboard 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.870
 the other three last red guys 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.650
 allows you to do maneuvers in the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.880
 ramp 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.740
 when you stop no position 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.310
 specific case in the last hour of 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.950
 hit will be red house she lets me 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.790
 make move in that angle here 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.260
 differentiated, I can walk after the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.030
 end of the activity angle that he knows 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.560
 kate are three types of maneuvers 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.270
 different in fact the same work 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.640
 however different angles I will put 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.690
 here and I'm going to come here to walk and from there it goes 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.820
 show in another completely 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.290
 differentiated because I can not do 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.520
 No play, I do not know why but I 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.560
 I can not because the general idea was 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.490
 you simply catch your skateboard looks 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.530
 down here 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.570
 the boy will aside and then he would give 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.840
 angle of a maneuver but is not answered 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.850
 God in playing there of the hour he holding 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.380
 it up on the ramp skate up 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.810
 this is the same maneuver except that a 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.280
 different angle in the case you who 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.650
 I think she needs it for you. 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.510
 same place the maneuvers is is to have six 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.830
 even promises not to have it with my team 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.600
 how it works but I think it should be 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.400
 even there we have this there are other 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.900
 who will see that his back turned to me 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.220
 I have to come here, sure you have to look. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.200
 down always down to one 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.260
 right in the position that I want I saw 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.200
 here and come here and try to get the angle 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.990
 here saif news until more craft is 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.670
 difficult to have a same value language or 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.480
 sometimes more than a certain goal guys 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.490
 Will you be able to make this move? 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.470
 because it 's very difficult to do is me 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.240
 It's really difficult, time has to come here. 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.370
 gives a little that will come to the camera because 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.390
 the guy who made a map and showed a 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.520
 video of him he can make of 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.960
 first but I suffered a boy in 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.400
 get the right angle the same idea 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.140
 you yet with skateboard to do 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.510
 I just can not move 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.880
 But good of the hour the girl well I liked it 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.170
 of this map and bar modding is pretty cool and 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.570
 The most interesting thing to call when 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.100
 serve is download it you can come 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.320
 I came here today. 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.570
 angel come out of the skateboard you see here 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.770
 Look brendon probe that there are items 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.170
 different here 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.310
 both have this enamel herman when 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.650
 you click the button you can 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.660
 create a clothing and from there you can 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.320
 create a ramp that also has this half 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.260
 pipe 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.850
 you can stay that is one or the other one 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.340
 dream even with the traffic to apply 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.110
 last is very much like the time works 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.310
 of you place here eight more feel 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.710
 join those you can do 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.870
 also it was not going to be nice that the cds 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.030
 create the ramps is the way you want 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.330
 is that mass and you can see max 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.770
 own legal circuit you can create 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.830
 in another skateboarding game nationally 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.470
 can create your own on the circuit 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.720
 nec nor tony hawk is a lot of people played 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.060
 better but then you can see here and O 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.729
 do the maneuvers the girl you have here 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.889
 Here the leap 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.139
 finally can do many things even he 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.580
 made a very complex and specific way
