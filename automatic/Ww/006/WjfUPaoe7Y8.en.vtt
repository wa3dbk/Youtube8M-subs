here you can see that we got the
sandstone<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> villagers<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.840> let's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
but that's it for this one guys and I'll

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.190 
but that's it for this one guys and I'll
show<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.190> guys<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.460> next<00:05:16.790> one<00:05:17.060> alright<00:05:17.870> guys

I'm<00:05:18.410> here<00:05:18.500> when<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.740> guys<00:05:18.830> box<00:05:19.160> craft<00:05:19.550> and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
I'm here when you guys box craft and

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.790 
I'm here when you guys box craft and
this<00:05:19.850> was<00:05:20.030> literally<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.510> opposite<00:05:21.290> of<00:05:21.440> every

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
this was literally the opposite of every

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.620 
this was literally the opposite of every
texture<00:05:22.130> pack<00:05:22.370> oh<00:05:22.550> my<00:05:22.790> god<00:05:22.940> resource<00:05:23.390> pack

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
texture pack oh my god resource pack

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.570 
texture pack oh my god resource pack
that<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:24.200> have<00:05:24.410> showed<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.800> guys<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:25.220> far<00:05:25.490> in

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
that I have showed you guys so far in

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.120 
that I have showed you guys so far in
this<00:05:25.669> video<00:05:25.850> this<00:05:26.419> one<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.750> a<00:05:26.780> non<00:05:27.080> HD<00:05:27.740> one<00:05:27.950> and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
this video this one is a non HD one and

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.070 
this video this one is a non HD one and
the<00:05:28.190> reason<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:28.520> there<00:05:28.850> is<00:05:29.030> non<00:05:29.330> HD<00:05:29.720> texture

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
the reason that there is non HD texture

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.870 
the reason that there is non HD texture
packs<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.440> because<00:05:30.650> some<00:05:30.860> people's<00:05:31.280> computer

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
packs is because some people's computer

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.270 
packs is because some people's computer
can't<00:05:32.540> run<00:05:32.780> HD<00:05:33.290> texture<00:05:33.620> packs<00:05:33.770> it<00:05:33.950> just<00:05:34.100> makes

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
can't run HD texture packs it just makes

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.219 
can't run HD texture packs it just makes
it<00:05:34.430> hard<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:34.700> run<00:05:34.940> or<00:05:35.330> even<00:05:35.360> normal<00:05:35.930> one<00:05:36.050> so

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
it hard to run or even normal one so

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.630 
it hard to run or even normal one so
there's<00:05:36.620> stuff<00:05:36.770> like<00:05:36.950> this<00:05:37.100> that<00:05:37.160> makes<00:05:37.490> it

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
there's stuff like this that makes it

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.630 
there's stuff like this that makes it
easier<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.450> run<00:05:38.630> like<00:05:39.169> lowering<00:05:40.010> down<00:05:40.220> so<00:05:40.550> as

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
easier to run like lowering down so as

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.760 
easier to run like lowering down so as
you<00:05:40.760> can<00:05:40.880> see<00:05:41.030> like<00:05:41.180> literally<00:05:41.570> like<00:05:41.770> those

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
you can see like literally like those

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.990 
you can see like literally like those
that's<00:05:43.010> I<00:05:43.130> think<00:05:43.190> that's<00:05:43.370> clay<00:05:43.640> yeah<00:05:43.820> that's

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
that's I think that's clay yeah that's

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.270 
that's I think that's clay yeah that's
clay<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.570> that's<00:05:45.020> dirt<00:05:45.320> like<00:05:45.560> these<00:05:45.770> this<00:05:46.130> is

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
clay and that's dirt like these this is

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.969 
clay and that's dirt like these this is
a<00:05:46.310> pretty<00:05:46.580> non<00:05:46.940> HD<00:05:47.180> one<00:05:47.540> but<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.290> like<00:05:48.500> kind<00:05:48.919> of

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
a pretty non HD one but I like kind of

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.490 
a pretty non HD one but I like kind of
the<00:05:49.070> cartoony<00:05:49.550> feel<00:05:49.790> but<00:05:50.270> sometimes<00:05:50.720> some<00:05:51.470> of

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
the cartoony feel but sometimes some of

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.650 
the cartoony feel but sometimes some of
them<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.770> can't<00:05:52.010> really<00:05:52.160> tell<00:05:52.490> you<00:05:53.360> know<00:05:53.390> what

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
them you can't really tell you know what

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.900 
them you can't really tell you know what
the<00:05:53.780> block<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.229> but<00:05:54.979> it's<00:05:55.130> good<00:05:55.340> for<00:05:55.580> people

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
the block is but it's good for people

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.580 
the block is but it's good for people
that<00:05:56.000> have<00:05:56.150> bad<00:05:56.330> computers<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.080> want<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.410> play

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
that have bad computers and want to play

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.190 
that have bad computers and want to play
Minecraft<00:05:58.130> just<00:05:58.880> base<00:05:59.240> it's<00:05:59.510> basically<00:05:59.930> the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
Minecraft just base it's basically the

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.830 
Minecraft just base it's basically the
the<00:06:00.500> original<00:06:00.770> one<00:06:01.130> just<00:06:01.430> really<00:06:01.880> non<00:06:02.150> HD<00:06:02.419> but

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
the original one just really non HD but

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.969 
the original one just really non HD but
it<00:06:02.930> kind<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.110> looks<00:06:03.320> cool<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.560> like<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.860> way

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
it kind of looks cool I like the way

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.190 
it kind of looks cool I like the way
kind<00:06:04.280> of<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.460> blocks<00:06:04.729> look<00:06:05.060> we'll<00:06:05.900> go<00:06:06.020> show

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
kind of the blocks look we'll go show

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.690 
kind of the blocks look we'll go show
you<00:06:06.260> guys<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.590> villagers<00:06:07.010> like<00:06:07.280> we've<00:06:07.550> been

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
doing for every texture pack and just

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.890 
doing for every texture pack and just
the<00:06:09.410> general<00:06:09.770> out<00:06:09.919> scape<00:06:10.250> or<00:06:10.700> a<00:06:10.729> line<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.270> what

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
the general out scape or a line of what

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
this texture pack or resource pack will

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.290 
this texture pack or resource pack will
look<00:06:15.770> like<00:06:15.919> in<00:06:16.100> a<00:06:16.160> normal<00:06:16.460> world<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.880> then<00:06:17.210> if

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
look like in a normal world and then if

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.820 
look like in a normal world and then if
you<00:06:17.390> choose<00:06:17.450> to<00:06:17.720> download<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.290> you<00:06:18.380> can<00:06:18.590> find

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
looks like because like I said I don't

one I what you can see there the

one I what you can see there the
villagers<00:06:25.640> they<00:06:25.850> literally<00:06:26.120> look<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.600> exact

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
villagers they literally look the exact
