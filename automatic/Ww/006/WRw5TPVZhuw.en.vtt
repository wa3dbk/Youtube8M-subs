football team this was the first time
that<00:00:27.020> any<00:00:27.590> iPhone<00:00:28.340> application<00:00:28.910> had<00:00:29.029> been

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
that any iPhone application had been

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.049 
that any iPhone application had been
made<00:00:29.449> tailored<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.500> university<00:00:33.969> you<00:00:34.969> have

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
made tailored to a university you have

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.639 
made tailored to a university you have
an<00:00:35.120> extraordinary<00:00:35.479> number<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:36.050> these<00:00:36.199> iphones

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
an extraordinary number of these iphones

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.910 
an extraordinary number of these iphones
that<00:00:36.829> are<00:00:36.920> very<00:00:37.100> sophisticated<00:00:37.550> devices<00:00:38.920> on

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
that are very sophisticated devices on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.729 
that are very sophisticated devices on
campus<00:00:40.519> and<00:00:40.639> classes<00:00:41.319> for<00:00:42.319> many<00:00:42.440> reasons

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
campus and classes for many reasons

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.289 
campus and classes for many reasons
whether<00:00:42.889> they're<00:00:43.129> their<00:00:43.339> academic<00:00:43.819> or<00:00:43.940> social

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
whether they're their academic or social

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.029 
whether they're their academic or social
so<00:00:44.600> why<00:00:44.749> not<00:00:44.929> have<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.199> mechanism<00:00:45.589> that

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
so why not have a mechanism that

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.910 
so why not have a mechanism that
utilizes<00:00:46.699> those<00:00:47.209> devices<00:00:47.569> just<00:00:48.199> like<00:00:48.379> Wi-Fi

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
utilizes those devices just like Wi-Fi

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.139 
utilizes those devices just like Wi-Fi
allows<00:00:49.190> people<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.489> take<00:00:49.670> advantage<00:00:49.819> of<00:00:49.999> their

looks much nicer works much better we
added<00:01:20.000> one<00:01:20.329> new<00:01:20.359> application<00:01:21.229> that<00:01:21.380> people

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
added one new application that people

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.080 
added one new application that people
didn't<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.100> before<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:22.789> called<00:01:22.969> the

didn't have before it's called the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.050 
didn't have before it's called the
events<00:01:23.390> application<00:01:23.929> with<00:01:24.380> certain<00:01:25.060> campus

events application with certain campus
services<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:26.810> events<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.619> actually<00:01:27.979> are

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
services like events we actually are

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.200 
services like events we actually are
giving<00:01:29.780> exposure<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.530> an<00:01:31.159> underused<00:01:31.729> service

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
giving exposure to an underused service

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.359 
giving exposure to an underused service
at<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.600> school<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.350> demographics<00:01:34.159> are

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
at the school the demographics are

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.669 
at the school the demographics are
showing<00:01:34.789> that<00:01:34.820> I'm<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.299> 18<00:01:35.689> to<00:01:35.810> 24<00:01:36.259> year<00:01:36.320> old

showing that I'm the 18 to 24 year old
age<00:01:37.340> range<00:01:37.789> that<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:39.560> little<00:01:39.890> device<00:01:40.039> here

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
age range that this little device here

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.300 
age range that this little device here
this<00:01:41.390> kind<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.990> technology<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.770> mobile<00:01:43.070> apps

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
this kind of technology the mobile apps

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.880 
this kind of technology the mobile apps
the<00:01:44.090> mobile<00:01:44.390> technologies<00:01:44.990> are<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.439> fastest

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the mobile technologies are the fastest

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.569 
the mobile technologies are the fastest
growing<00:01:45.950> platform<00:01:47.319> higher<00:01:48.319> than<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.799> laptop

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
growing platform higher than the laptop

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.059 
growing platform higher than the laptop
itself<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.319> knew<00:01:51.499> that<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:51.799> were<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.039> to

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
itself so we knew that we were on to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.010 
itself so we knew that we were on to
something<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.640> technology<00:01:53.240> associated<00:01:53.810> with

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
something the technology associated with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.739 
something the technology associated with
authenticating<00:01:54.859> and<00:01:55.299> identifying<00:01:56.299> students

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
authenticating and identifying students

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.279 
authenticating and identifying students
is<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.350> know<00:01:57.439> 30<00:01:57.740> 40<00:01:58.159> years<00:01:58.460> old<00:01:58.609> and<00:01:59.229> now<00:02:00.229> we

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
is you know 30 40 years old and now we

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.010 
is you know 30 40 years old and now we
have<00:02:00.380> an<00:02:00.560> opportunity<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:01.100> rethink<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
have an opportunity to rethink that so I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.819 
have an opportunity to rethink that so I
i<00:02:03.530> I'd<00:02:03.950> like<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.310> see<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:04.969> going<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.929> far

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
i I'd like to see this going that far

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.089 
i I'd like to see this going that far
enough<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.929> replace<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.140> ID<00:02:09.289> card<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.799> you

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
enough to replace the ID card and you

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.800 
enough to replace the ID card and you
came<00:02:10.369> completely<00:02:10.970> from<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.420> different

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
came completely from a different

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.680 
came completely from a different
standpoint<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.000> challenged

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
standpoint and so that really challenged

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.250 
standpoint and so that really challenged
me<00:02:14.900> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
me to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.380 
me to
think<00:02:15.409> differently<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.519> not<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:16.909> much<00:02:16.970> what

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
think differently it's not so much what

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.050 
think differently it's not so much what
I<00:02:17.780> think<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.470> service<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.010> how<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.220> engage

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
I think of the service is how you engage

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.149 
I think of the service is how you engage
in<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.780> service<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.590> last<00:02:21.769> application

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
in the service and the last application

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.009 
in the service and the last application
here<00:02:22.549> is<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.970> courses<00:02:23.299> application<00:02:23.870> which

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
here is the courses application which

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.690 
here is the courses application which
people<00:02:24.349> are<00:02:24.439> familiar<00:02:24.590> with<00:02:24.829> essentially

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
people are familiar with essentially

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.429 
people are familiar with essentially
lets<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:26.000> look<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.420> course<00:02:26.870> catalog<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
lets you look at the course catalog the

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.130 
lets you look at the course catalog the
stanford<00:02:27.739> course<00:02:27.950> catalog<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.610> think

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
stanford course catalog I think

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.740 
stanford course catalog I think
entrepreneurial<00:02:30.140> ism<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.730> DNA<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
entrepreneurial ism is in the DNA of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.819 
entrepreneurial ism is in the DNA of
Stanford<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.390> inventiveness<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
Stanford right and inventiveness is the

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.170 
Stanford right and inventiveness is the
is<00:02:37.069> what<00:02:37.849> people<00:02:38.030> come<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.019> Stanford<00:02:39.290> for

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
is what people come to Stanford for

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180 
is what people come to Stanford for
expect<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.359> they<00:02:41.840> look<00:02:42.079> for<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.590> they<00:02:43.010> want

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
expect it they look for it and they want

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.300 
expect it they look for it and they want
to<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.340> part<00:02:43.609> of<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.849> and<00:02:44.829> then<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:45.950> realize

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to be part of it and then you realize

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:59.620 
to be part of it and then you realize
this<00:02:47.030> school<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.480> anything<00:02:48.019> but<00:02:48.500> normal

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.280 

you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
