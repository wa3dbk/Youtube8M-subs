knifing<00:00:13.870> part<00:00:14.139> refers<00:00:14.740> to<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:15.009> fact<00:00:15.219> that<00:00:15.309> you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
knifing part refers to the fact that you

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.130 
knifing part refers to the fact that you
spread<00:00:15.700> it<00:00:15.759> on<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:16.059> wood<00:00:16.330> with<00:00:16.569> a<00:00:16.599> knife<00:00:16.869> and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
spread it on the wood with a knife and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.079 
spread it on the wood with a knife and
this<00:00:17.619> knife<00:00:17.829> input<00:00:18.189> is<00:00:18.519> in<00:00:18.699> no<00:00:18.880> way<00:00:19.060> connected

this knife input is in no way connected
with<00:00:19.899> any<00:00:20.050> serial<00:00:20.619> killing<00:00:20.949> applications<00:00:21.640> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
with any serial killing applications and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.200 
with any serial killing applications and
before<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.439> voices<00:00:23.829> returned<00:00:24.279> I<00:00:24.519> went<00:00:25.029> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
before the voices returned I went and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.729 
before the voices returned I went and
bought<00:00:25.359> some<00:00:25.419> more<00:00:25.749> cellulose<00:00:26.259> thinners<00:00:26.619> and

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
bought some more cellulose thinners and

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.589 
bought some more cellulose thinners and
I'm<00:00:27.130> putting<00:00:27.429> the<00:00:27.519> cellulose<00:00:27.939> thinners<00:00:28.329> in<00:00:28.479> my

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
I'm putting the cellulose thinners in my

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.899 
I'm putting the cellulose thinners in my
container<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.439> never<00:00:30.130> mentioned<00:00:30.369> in<00:00:30.639> the<00:00:30.789> other

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
container I never mentioned in the other

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.090 
container I never mentioned in the other
videos<00:00:31.329> but<00:00:31.599> these<00:00:31.809> containers<00:00:32.529> must<00:00:32.710> be<00:00:32.920> made

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
videos but these containers must be made

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.250 
videos but these containers must be made
of<00:00:33.219> a<00:00:33.309> polythene<00:00:33.820> material<00:00:34.359> as<00:00:34.660> cellulose

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
of a polythene material as cellulose

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.970 
of a polythene material as cellulose
thinners<00:00:35.679> will<00:00:35.859> dissolve<00:00:36.250> most<00:00:36.640> plastics<00:00:37.300> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
thinners will dissolve most plastics I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.919 
thinners will dissolve most plastics I
always<00:00:38.980> recycle<00:00:39.699> my<00:00:39.820> cellulose<00:00:40.329> thinners<00:00:40.719> and

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
always recycle my cellulose thinners and

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.630 
always recycle my cellulose thinners and
just<00:00:41.289> for<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.500> change<00:00:41.769> it's<00:00:42.010> nice<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.399> start

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
just for the change it's nice to start

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.150 
just for the change it's nice to start
with<00:00:42.910> some<00:00:43.089> fresh<00:00:43.329> stuff<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.739> as<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:44.980> will

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
with some fresh stuff but as you will

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.860 
with some fresh stuff but as you will
see<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.670> will<00:00:45.910> not<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:46.420> this<00:00:46.629> for<00:00:46.839> very

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
see it will not be like this for very

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.139 
see it will not be like this for very
long<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:48.100> first<00:00:48.370> thing<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.699> go<00:00:48.820> into<00:00:48.940> the

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
long the first thing to go into the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.509 
long the first thing to go into the
thinners<00:00:49.510> bath<00:00:49.749> is<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.620> flywheel<00:00:51.249> and<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
thinners bath is the flywheel and the

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.869 
thinners bath is the flywheel and the
crank<00:00:52.300> assemblies<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.980> rotating<00:00:54.550> the

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
crank assemblies I'm rotating the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.970 
crank assemblies I'm rotating the
flywheel<00:00:55.329> so<00:00:55.929> that<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.199> gets<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.530> good<00:00:56.710> coating

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
flywheel so that it gets a good coating

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.840 
flywheel so that it gets a good coating
of<00:00:57.219> cellulose<00:00:57.699> thinners<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.730> while<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
of cellulose thinners and while the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.250 
of cellulose thinners and while the
cellulose<00:01:01.269> thinners<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:01.780> working<00:01:02.109> on<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
cellulose thinners is working on the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.350 
cellulose thinners is working on the
flywheel<00:01:02.499> I'm<00:01:03.129> also<00:01:03.460> applying<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.059> thinness

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
flywheel I'm also applying the thinness

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.740 
flywheel I'm also applying the thinness
to<00:01:04.479> one<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.839> bed<00:01:04.989> castings<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.270> process

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
to one of the bed castings this process

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.620 
to one of the bed castings this process
really<00:01:08.110> does<00:01:08.259> take<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.649> long<00:01:08.920> time<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
really does take a long time you have to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.330 
really does take a long time you have to
give<00:01:10.780> sufficient<00:01:10.990> time<00:01:11.350> for<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:11.890> cellulose

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
give sufficient time for the cellulose

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.639 
give sufficient time for the cellulose
thinness<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.850> eat<00:01:13.030> into<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.509> paint<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.020> I

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
thinness to eat into the paint and I

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.410 
thinness to eat into the paint and I
haven't<00:01:14.890> video<00:01:15.220> on<00:01:15.369> that<00:01:15.520> part<00:01:15.820> because<00:01:16.030> that

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
haven't video on that part because that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.830 
haven't video on that part because that
would<00:01:16.570> be<00:01:16.719> very<00:01:16.899> tedious<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.979> is<00:01:18.159> bad<00:01:18.340> enough

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
would be very tedious this is bad enough

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.480 
would be very tedious this is bad enough
this<00:01:19.840> looks<00:01:20.079> a<00:01:20.229> very<00:01:20.259> easy<00:01:20.590> thing<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:21.009> do<00:01:21.280> but

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
this looks a very easy thing to do but

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.160 
this looks a very easy thing to do but
that<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.790> little<00:01:22.030> bit<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.420> technique<00:01:22.840> in

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
that is a little bit of a technique in

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.870 
that is a little bit of a technique in
the<00:01:23.500> way<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.680> apply<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.130> thinners<00:01:24.579> with<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the way you apply the thinners with the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.569 
the way you apply the thinners with the
brush<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.719> quite<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> stiff<00:01:26.350> brush<00:01:26.649> but<00:01:27.340> if

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
brush this is quite a stiff brush but if

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.520 
brush this is quite a stiff brush but if
I<00:01:27.759> don't<00:01:28.000> apply<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.390> thinners<00:01:28.840> properly<00:01:29.259> it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
I don't apply the thinners properly it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.429 
I don't apply the thinners properly it
splashes<00:01:30.159> everywhere<00:01:30.390> including<00:01:31.439> splashing

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
splashes everywhere including splashing

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.959 
splashes everywhere including splashing
onto<00:01:32.710> me<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:32.979> I<00:01:33.039> don't<00:01:33.100> really<00:01:33.369> want<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.759> do

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
onto me and I don't really want it to do

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.609 
onto me and I don't really want it to do
that<00:01:34.210> because<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:35.049> says<00:01:35.229> in<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.500> instructions

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
that because it says in the instructions

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.850 
that because it says in the instructions
do<00:01:36.549> not<00:01:36.579> handle<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.299> well<00:01:38.079> I<00:01:38.110> get<00:01:38.289> very<00:01:38.530> little

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
do not handle it well I get very little

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.920 
do not handle it well I get very little
of<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.189> on<00:01:39.399> my<00:01:39.549> fingers<00:01:40.000> or<00:01:40.329> on<00:01:40.630> any<00:01:40.810> other

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
of this on my fingers or on any other

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.170 
of this on my fingers or on any other
part<00:01:41.289> of<00:01:41.469> me<00:01:41.590> for<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.890> matter<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.399> it's<00:01:42.939> down

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
part of me for that matter and it's down

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.670 
part of me for that matter and it's down
to<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.479> way<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:43.990> apply<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.350> with<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
to the way that you apply it with the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
because it moves around a bit I'm taking

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.380 
because it moves around a bit I'm taking
this<00:02:23.890> opportunity<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.760> clean<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> cross

difficult grime with the ruler I know
this<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.370> quite<00:02:33.550> boring<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.150> very<00:02:34.420> tedious

more<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.740> for<00:02:35.950> me<00:02:36.070> in<00:02:36.310> real<00:02:36.550> time<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.570> I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
more so for me in real time but I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.420 
more so for me in real time but I
thought<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.990> would<00:02:38.170> show<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.830> its<00:02:38.950> entirety

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.070 
thought I would show it in its entirety
just<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> change

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
just for a change

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.380 
just for a change

this is particularly grimy and it's

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.550 
this is particularly grimy and it's
going<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.780> need<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.960> little<00:02:47.290> more<00:02:47.470> than

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
going to need a little more than

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.590 
going to need a little more than
