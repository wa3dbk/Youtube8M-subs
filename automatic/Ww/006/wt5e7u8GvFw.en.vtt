00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.419
 katia vandenberghe cd v 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.519
 just like you have a tv on this a martyr like demy long time ago i was 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.700
 of course not to play the black ops in los angeles anp 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.220
 and I still had a cup of tea in December and that's a bit I don't have you either 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 After all, I am standing in the Dembélé abyss with the press 7 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.550
 on this his wife also call him 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.749
 and these are 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.969
 a shot 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120
 and as soon as you know what that means 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 each a bullet that wants to shoot you must again you shoot over impressions and you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.990
 hear that at the voip tree tree tree tree tree 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.360
 who cannot shoot quickly 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.610
 what a tent is the problem 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.880
 both two-step experience for investors 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.990
 who really is very strong can handle it there is said Medvedev July 31 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.630
 where should they see quickly if you want 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.830
 mention this chaib so often 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.880
 who has and drove certain traffic jam 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.220
 and no matter how fast you press the newspaper button no matter how fast you shoot 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 you are not going to be able to just shoot with it than what I can if you see that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.670
 i like trying to make love to someone who is sport and business world 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.650
 and even though you make a trip on a non-profit organization, wieman needs to turn around for how long 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.570
 I chose a lot of audiences that chose short distances in the two if you did 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.800
 good touch that call does old trafford against of course 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.530
 but you just see that i am well balanced all this except 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.100
 are of course likely to be used to it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.300
 That's because the weapons that the animals use it 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.179
 should use more on long distances on short distances 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.390
 m it's own type of replacement 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.580
 yes i can know the color of the ballot hall typical building 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.730
 yolanthe is endemic of 3 5 the celts are waiting for a subscription 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.320
 i think it's safe reason beyond 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.740
 so is so did recommend to use this weapon ns put buses in the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 maatpolder is just k12 running don't think cards ballpoint kiele kiele 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.090
 kiele kiele kiele but this is a more tactical weapon courage is better at 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 think how they walk around how you determined a good so 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 we hope to go with the canteen inside I had to go shopping here short 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.979
 distances risk countries to choose as 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.530
 but is of course handy with this weapon to all polans distances only with 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.169
 shoot 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.580
 and so I try to take part in 800 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.500
 The game is really on the low side, you also have to score the goals you need 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.169
 you just sit where as well because it is very easily explained 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.669
 but and where they are so well balanced proteins grandpa ever he is not the 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.199
 planned construction art you can killer with it if you just make sense 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.079
 think 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.589
 sister and i am to use as an honor to use and i feel like it 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.570
 I feel like a little bad here 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.460
 it is a weapon of course for those with the least rest 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.389
 played for the real calf injury 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.359
 then you are not going to be able to turn with this weapon that it was just whole 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.439
 explained simply because yes then well from a part 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.370
 the irony both roads talking specific york on 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.459
 see bottom right picture that it is a specialist 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.959
 but to activate it immediately 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.400
 I have I get points per kilo of Mercedes 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.050
 per flag of course means a lot of people discount from hadise I have more 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.689
 turned on 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.970
 The yellow signs are now also in on last Thursday 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.310
 wild the plan 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.170
 that's 200 instead of normal points that of course gets it and that comes 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.660
 because it determined 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.210
 Zwijsenstraat is fairly fast 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.350
 so the most convenient of course is to turn it on but the place of birth 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.790
 sirte 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.969
 in front of me with the point three goals ahead is the leader 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.289
 at the moment that your card is a panther you can do so in a very short time 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.649
 very quickly by that specialist 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.849
 the suspension rooms 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.799
 and then of course what you want nothing to catch cortez reese pupil so as everything 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.209
 to use it you do not get extra premiums measuring technique extra diverse 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.569
 with it or whatever but you only get extra points with it really whole 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.119
 nice 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.760
 very handy stress test to use for the moment that you just fast 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.839
 want to hit the balance 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.890
 they will be set world records again this year 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.710
 Imposing, for example, says a brief outline with all mind gains for men 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.580
 and women 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.730
 ten seconds 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.300
 and it remains just natural accident moment you turn it on you 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.930
 started because something is coming your way you need good luck 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.480
 of course 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.880
 Dekker actually tilted the week to agree to get people over once 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.669
 that your pain has ended and you can 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.060
 the double points on the board can now use the other 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.019
 he explained that 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.680
 we just have to start with a building site and of course I am not whole 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.090
 quickly visit corsica 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.130
 very nice to use as one to use but i had i let you 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.930
 briefly the check that are practical often 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 and as seen 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.760
 a bullet you can shoot at a time then you must try again and press 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.289
 experiences complains they must both play tactically cleverly and then and thereby 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.690
 the reasonable rule i want may do as long as you are with 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.390
 to think 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.150
 it was we are playing 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.870
 And yes she is that she must be a player that we cannot give anyone that chance 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.199
 now some people are playing 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.759
 the rider off a ban 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.039
 very sorry I had known more about it 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.979
 people must have because he shows his place on the e403 in between card 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.520
 woudenberg Driebergen could of course also be transferred via and 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.159
 yes I am very excited I am always there that comes out we can break 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.409
 go to play was burned out idea 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.569
 both view and yet monday knives
