Rachel<00:00:14.620> wants<00:00:14.830> to<00:00:14.980> do<00:00:15.130> a<00:00:15.160> Swimathon<00:00:15.640> and<00:00:16.650> she

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
Rachel wants to do a Swimathon and she

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.470 
Rachel wants to do a Swimathon and she
realized<00:00:18.010> that<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.220> stroke<00:00:18.550> need<00:00:18.790> improving

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
realized that a stroke need improving

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.210 
realized that a stroke need improving
now<00:00:20.020> what<00:00:20.170> you<00:00:20.320> see<00:00:20.560> here<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:20.950> a<00:00:20.980> very

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
now what you see here is a very

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.280 
now what you see here is a very

inefficient from callin back stroke many
many<00:00:23.590> strokes<00:00:24.010> per<00:00:24.250> length<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:25.540> almost

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
many strokes per length it almost

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.810 
many strokes per length it almost
impossible<00:00:26.080> number<00:00:26.950> of<00:00:27.040> strokes<00:00:27.310> per<00:00:27.640> length

impossible number of strokes per length

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.480 
impossible number of strokes per length
and<00:00:28.150> of<00:00:28.990> course<00:00:29.259> she<00:00:29.470> did<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.619> Swimathon<00:00:29.950> using

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
and of course she did a Swimathon using

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.640 
and of course she did a Swimathon using
those<00:00:30.640> kind<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:30.970> strokes<00:00:31.330> she'd<00:00:32.140> be<00:00:32.290> in<00:00:32.410> danger

those kind of strokes she'd be in danger

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.780 
those kind of strokes she'd be in danger
of<00:00:34.980> injuring<00:00:35.980> herself<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:36.430> would<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:36.640> thought

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
of injuring herself I would have thought

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.300 
of injuring herself I would have thought
at<00:00:36.940> least<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.590> she's<00:00:38.710> at<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.980> end<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
at least so that she's at the end of the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.580 
at least so that she's at the end of the
first<00:00:39.579> one-hour<00:00:40.000> lesson<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.690> we've<00:00:41.380> reduced

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
first one-hour lesson and we've reduced

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.370 
first one-hour lesson and we've reduced
the<00:00:42.040> number<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.430> strokes<00:00:42.790> per<00:00:43.120> length<00:00:43.330> by<00:00:43.720> half

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
the number of strokes per length by half

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.730 
the number of strokes per length by half
at<00:00:44.710> least<00:00:44.740> and<00:00:45.400> we've<00:00:46.240> got<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.570> idea<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:47.260> the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
at least and we've got the idea of the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.260 
at least and we've got the idea of the
head<00:00:47.950> leading<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.760> art<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.150> the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
head leading and the art and the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.390 
head leading and the art and the
direction<00:00:49.630> in<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:49.930> forward<00:00:50.320> arm<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:51.100> arms

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
direction in the forward arm the arms

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.940 
direction in the forward arm the arms
working<00:00:51.790> as<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.940> pair<00:00:52.330> instead<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.410> competing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
working as a pair instead of competing

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.650 
working as a pair instead of competing
with<00:00:54.130> each<00:00:54.310> other<00:00:54.460> as<00:00:54.640> they<00:00:54.670> were<00:00:54.820> before<00:00:55.150> so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
with each other as they were before so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.740 
with each other as they were before so
we've<00:00:56.260> got<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.860> stroke<00:00:57.340> involving<00:00:57.970> two<00:00:58.300> arms

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
we've got one stroke involving two arms

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.870 
we've got one stroke involving two arms
and<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:58.960> role<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.440> body<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.010> that's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
and the role of the body and that's

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.640 
and the role of the body and that's
after<00:01:01.420> one<00:01:01.570> lesson<00:01:01.780> she's<00:01:02.050> doing<00:01:02.320> very<00:01:02.560> well

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
after one lesson she's doing very well

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.030 
after one lesson she's doing very well
to<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.970> get<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.299> new<00:01:04.479> idea<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.920> end

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
to to get that new idea this is the end

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.740 
to to get that new idea this is the end
of<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.250> first<00:01:09.490> lesson<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.180> she's<00:01:10.570> just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
of the first lesson and she's just

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.149 
of the first lesson and she's just
trying<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.140> make<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.619> new<00:01:11.799> stroke

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
trying to make this the new stroke

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.580 
trying to make this the new stroke
around<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.759> little<00:01:12.850> bit<00:01:13.150> do<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.719> in<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.020> at<00:01:14.409> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
around a little bit do it in this at the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.319 
around a little bit do it in this at the
same<00:01:14.890> sort<00:01:15.219> of<00:01:15.399> speech<00:01:15.729> she<00:01:15.909> was<00:01:16.030> doing<00:01:16.270> her

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
same sort of speech she was doing her

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.310 
same sort of speech she was doing her
old<00:01:16.509> stroke<00:01:16.899> but<00:01:17.649> with<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:17.950> new<00:01:18.100> glide<00:01:18.460> idea

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
old stroke but with the new glide idea

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.749 
old stroke but with the new glide idea
this<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:20.649> start<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.130> second<00:01:21.549> lesson

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
this is the start of the second lesson

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.050 
this is the start of the second lesson
and<00:01:22.499> you<00:01:23.499> can<00:01:23.679> see<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.340> stroke<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.850> much

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
and you can see that the stroke is much

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.959 
and you can see that the stroke is much
more<00:01:25.469> part<00:01:26.469> of<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.859> much<00:01:27.009> more<00:01:27.189> natural<00:01:27.460> than

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
more part of a much more natural than

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.249 
more part of a much more natural than
than<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.509> end<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.840> last<00:01:29.020> lesson

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
than the end of the last lesson

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.359 
than the end of the last lesson
yesterday<00:01:30.539> she's<00:01:31.539> she's<00:01:32.469> made<00:01:32.679> around<00:01:33.039> she's

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
yesterday she's she's made around she's

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.450 
yesterday she's she's made around she's
absorbed<00:01:33.939> it<00:01:34.319> without<00:01:35.319> really<00:01:35.649> practicing<00:01:36.310> it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
absorbed it without really practicing it

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.719 
absorbed it without really practicing it
just<00:01:37.649> been<00:01:38.649> embedded<00:01:38.979> into<00:01:39.219> a<00:01:39.340> brain

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
just been embedded into a brain

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.120 
just been embedded into a brain
overnight<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.719> here's<00:01:41.499> the<00:01:41.829> end<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.069> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
overnight and here's the end of the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.260 
overnight and here's the end of the
lesson<00:01:42.310> towards<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.939> end<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.149> lesson

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
lesson towards the end of the lesson

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.520 
lesson towards the end of the lesson
we're<00:01:43.630> looking<00:01:43.899> at<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.079> braiding<00:01:44.409> we've

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
we're looking at the braiding we've

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.499 
we're looking at the braiding we've
covered<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:45.069> kicking<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.969> side<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.420> the

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
covered the kicking on the side with the

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.539 
covered the kicking on the side with the
face<00:01:46.719> out<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.109> water<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.069> she's<00:01:48.249> learned

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
face out of the water so she's learned

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.279 
face out of the water so she's learned
the<00:01:48.729> balance<00:01:49.149> braiding<00:01:49.600> position<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.109> now

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
the balance braiding position and now

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.499 
the balance braiding position and now
the<00:01:50.979> breathing<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.460> much<00:01:51.639> more<00:01:51.850> part<00:01:52.209> of<00:01:52.389> a

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
the breathing is much more part of a

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.139 
the breathing is much more part of a
stroke<00:01:53.100> whereas<00:01:54.100> before<00:01:54.490> she<00:01:54.520> was<00:01:54.880> kind<00:01:55.090> of

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
stroke whereas before she was kind of

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.270 
stroke whereas before she was kind of
breathing<00:01:55.479> as<00:01:55.569> a<00:01:55.600> separate<00:01:56.079> event<00:01:56.409> which<00:01:57.100> was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
breathing as a separate event which was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.160 
breathing as a separate event which was
disturbing<00:01:57.909> what<00:01:58.119> rhythms<00:01:58.450> she<00:01:58.630> did<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:59.020> in

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
disturbing what rhythms she did have in

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.879 
disturbing what rhythms she did have in
a<00:01:59.259> stroke<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.689> only<00:02:01.929> thing<00:02:02.079> left<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.469> look<00:02:02.649> out

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
a stroke the only thing left to look out

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.429 
a stroke the only thing left to look out
really<00:02:03.810> considering<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.899> short<00:02:05.109> space<00:02:05.380> of

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
really considering the short space of

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.520 
really considering the short space of
time<00:02:05.590> we've<00:02:05.979> had<00:02:06.549> with<00:02:06.789> her<00:02:06.939> is<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:08.350> need<00:02:08.500> a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
time we've had with her is we need a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.260 
time we've had with her is we need a
little<00:02:08.770> bit<00:02:08.890> more<00:02:09.069> power<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> arm

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
little bit more power in the in the arm

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.790 
little bit more power in the in the arm
on<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.479> back<00:02:10.690> end<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> stroke<00:02:11.470> under

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
on the back end of the stroke under

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.160 
on the back end of the stroke under
water<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:13.000> we've<00:02:13.209> just<00:02:13.480> worked<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.959> this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
water and here we've just worked on this

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.699 
water and here we've just worked on this
and<00:02:14.680> now<00:02:15.190> we've<00:02:15.400> got<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.480> arm<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.530> water

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
and now we've got the arm and the water

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.890 
and now we've got the arm and the water
sweeping<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.670> create<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> glide<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
sweeping to create the glide for the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.610 
sweeping to create the glide for the
forward

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
forward

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
forward
and<00:02:20.980> again<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.670> breeding<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.120> nicely<00:02:22.959> into

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and again the breeding is nicely into

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.009 
and again the breeding is nicely into
graduating<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.709> stroke<00:02:24.099> there<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.599> here

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
graduating to the stroke there and here

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.630 
graduating to the stroke there and here
we<00:02:26.140> had<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> quick<00:02:26.500> look<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.709> backstroke<00:02:27.340> and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
we had a quick look a backstroke and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.320 
we had a quick look a backstroke and
that's<00:02:28.330> lovely<00:02:28.599> very<00:02:29.260> much<00:02:29.470> nicer<00:02:29.769> than<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that's lovely very much nicer than the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.699 
that's lovely very much nicer than the
basket<00:02:31.629> oh<00:02:31.690> she<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.900> doing<00:02:32.110> before<00:02:32.260> where<00:02:32.590> she

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
basket oh she was doing before where she

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.670 
basket oh she was doing before where she
was<00:02:32.830> again<00:02:33.099> doing<00:02:33.430> very<00:02:34.000> many<00:02:34.650> too<00:02:35.650> many

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
was again doing very many too many

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.110 
was again doing very many too many
strokes<00:02:36.190> per<00:02:36.400> length<00:02:36.580> he<00:02:37.450> was<00:02:37.599> got<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> glide
