00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello to you a yogi has not arrived 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.379
 a lot of requests and video requests 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 please learn to draw your own and make 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.330
 video lesson I decided but why not 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.610
 learn him what I know myself so first 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 get started up and you need to create 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.779
 a new document but rather a document and not 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 the canvas as it is here called on 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.189
 English version of canvas to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 call the menu to create a new canvas 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 click the new file 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.910
 You will see this menu here. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.189
 offer to set a name for our canvas 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 and you any template we do that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 let's not it is not necessarily all that to us 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 it is necessary to choose the height and width and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.629
 press the ok button in this case size 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 my tail is 100 by 100 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 centimeters I just like to draw 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 passed the square this is a convenient place a lot 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 and so here is our blank canvas 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
 choose the color we can on the palette to me 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.539
 really like a liter she is very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 comfortable with something reminiscent of the palette and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.360
 soon in panthers as in any raster 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 the editor has a navigator he helps 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.219
 easy to navigate the figure serves 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 simultaneous victor sketches we can 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.570
 see our drawing a reduced view 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 under the sketches there are sliders who 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 zoom and rotate sheet very 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080
 conveniently 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.460
 we can use both sliders so 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.460
 and nearby buttons 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.610
 like this, everything goes fine for 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.610
 visibility honest rush 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.520
 how all peppers are much clearer and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.130
 turns over now as for 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
 decoration and toolbar like 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.630
 see the toolbar in my color 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.120
 are located on the left while the panel 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.130
 I can see layers on the right 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.870
 change everything to fix this loan 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.150
 in the bin bin tab there you will find 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.979
 show this or that panel on the right or 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.020
 on the left, choose as you like here 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.550
 one chooses to your taste and on 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.360
 taste and color as you know all the markers 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.160
 various 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.110
 Thanks to the Japanese for the opportunity to 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.090
 styling programs because for example 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.040
 I feel uncomfortable when everything is brought down somewhere 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.020
 to the left someone like the opposite 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 now it's time to talk a bit 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.970
 about tools tools with and not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.010
 very many but not all varied 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.170
 cool nevertheless i use very 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.330
 many of them are basically tough 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.160
 brush and 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.830
 fender but you can not underestimate such 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 tool like a pen a pen is perfect for 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.880
 contours though I still love more 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.070
 use a hard brush here's a pen 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.980
 used to always use it for 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.770
 the contours of the word I am now on the graphic 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.870
 the tablet is therefore from the elephant to press n for 1 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.700
 It depends on the thickness of each line 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.430
 tool can change this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.010
 parameter as edge stiffness 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 the instrument feasts is not particularly noticeable that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.860
 and draw hard edges with soft 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 the edges are the same but if you choose 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.740
 at least 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.420
 airbrush then the difference will be immediately on face 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.790
 now let's choose 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 airbrush now setting stiffness as 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.170
 see it stands on the brightest and now you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.420
 the hardest there is a difference here is the average 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.610
 closer to soft and medium closer to 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.740
 hard this way the rigidity of the brush 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.930
 can be customized to taste as you like 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.209
 truth with one detail vr past which not 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 like to mix them and those to her 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.120
 You can screw this parameter with 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.430
 slider blade 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.770
 so create new brushes in sai 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.810
 the parameter minimum is also important 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.239
 brush size implies the most 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.910
 the minimum threshold that is something. thickness with 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.130
 which we start when our feather 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.959
 barely touches the tablet as you can see 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.530
 now i use the same 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.660
 tool 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.209
 garbage just changing the parameters in it and 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.160
 It turns out completely different brushes worth 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.480
 experiment with them hold 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.819
 exactly the same experiment 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.739
 with pen tool and pen draw 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.569
 note that I have a minimum threshold 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.430
 zero percent and now we change it 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.830
 up to 100 percent and as you can see 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.260
 nothing changes from pressing the pen 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.390
 convenient to do an even dotted line and now i'm 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 show you such a cool cool 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.940
 tool like mixing that is 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.160
 blender 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.900
 if you are an artist of traditional style i 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.000
 thought you remember a tool like 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.280
 blender that exists in real 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.260
 this blender is just like him 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.599
 he is able to mix not only markers 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.640
 but also any paint I really like this 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.160
 the tool now I will put a lot of paint 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.079
 and try to smear like this 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 maybe in the end we even 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.280
 something happens usually I do not use 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.830
 this tool on colorful drawings 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.750
 I am at first in black and white 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.210
 but for clarity, we show you 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.190
 on this example, the chip tool blend 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.410
 the fact that the stronger you are at him I mean 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.460
 the stronger the first to share 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.430
 poison which 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.210
 which one is chosen the more he acts 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.330
 on drawing 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.669
 I am almost mad smear and turns 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.479
 something interesting 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.479
 maybe even a flower 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.930
 note that I have selected 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.690
 just white but when i smear 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.490
 all adjacent colors cling except 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.020
 they are slightly brightened if u 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.090
 i will be black flower he was 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.190
 watercolor smeared very advise you 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.390
 experiment with this tool 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.220
 he is very interesting from him 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:09.040
 much to achieve yes and still I 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.310
 turned out to be a flower for the picture room 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.970
 I'll give him a stem and petals 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.690
 same blender well yes yes love this 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.670
 I have interesting tools 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.590
 now green is our chosen layout 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.230
 world press and it turns out almost that 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.740
 transparent as cool as watercolor 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.740
 paint 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.499
 in pencils 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.360
 Here is such a flower 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 as in any paint program with 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.380
 and there is mercy now too 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.540
 demonstrate plastic to any 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.280
 the tool is co and easy to set up and we 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.320
 just like any other brush 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.150
 You can set the thickness softness such 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.070
 Your plastic may look like 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.410
 fine hard brush off and soft 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.090
 the similarity of the nag does not know this ring 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.460
 something like with the Turks which washes 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.960
 just a few tones for now it's all in 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.540
 next lesson i will tell you about 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.840
 basics of creating transformation brushes 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.580
 base layer drawing selection and fill 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.070
 subscribe to the channel so that nothing 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.310
 miss all thanks while you were 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.310
 I'm a driver
