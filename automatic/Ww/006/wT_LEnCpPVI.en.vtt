00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 Now for hydraulics such 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.500
 undergone changes the tractor was say 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 as standard, that is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.310
 there is a standard distributor it 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.710
 which raises only a hitch back 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.439
 there is no forced lowering 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.580
 resetted beginner she 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 is in float mode 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.610
 the dispenser comes here from this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.680
 pump ns what are the changes here 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.710
 have occurred 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.460
 This one was installed here 4 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.610
 sectional distributor Bulgarian 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 production stage poverty 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.489
 principle, the optimal ratio 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.010
 price-quality is it compact and pretty 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.809
 easy to move lever 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 here again we have 4 sections 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.570
 this is the optimal principle he does not have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 floating mode but for those who are 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 must be valid if you need to get 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.040
 floating 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:27.460
 boom actions to the front all that is it 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.290
 can be combined roughly with a crane section and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.520
 they will be translated floating mode and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 so here is the oil supply tube from n.sh. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.330
 she walked alongside this bank 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.520
 this is a regular distributor here I am 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 cut and transferred to this three-way 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.810
 crane three-way crane German this too 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.200
 hansa flex here separately couplings 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.960
 separately couplings 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.250
 these couplings they do not come with a crane 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.659
 additionally screw in that is 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 principle with this tap you can 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.899
 use a tube and a diameter and 14 and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.399
 16 10 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.069
 the coupling is an adapter to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:19.060
 the right diameter is already the tube but we are here 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.230
 Here we see such a tube in the first version 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 the hydraulic systems here have done everything 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:31.579
 hoses and there were adapters 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.000
 these adapters were rather production 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.510
 Whole China is not factory Chinese 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.690
 artisanal over time all this was 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.549
 replaced by German components 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.530
 there is this one too all this hansa flex 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.769
 the crane has several positions here in 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.000
 this situation is under control 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.400
 directly 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.579
 native distributor here is this tube 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.209
 she goes to the regular entrance 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.760
 the distributor and the tube we are 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.829
 Connection is closer to 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:14.450
 it is always marked on the nameplate 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:19.299
 letter and there is no such distributor 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.200
 Regime as Soviet our usual 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.060
 common dispenser ah then 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.940
 there is an hour to click here 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.250
 bang function growl implemented 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.160
 but pressure is relieved by bypass 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.940
 valve like 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.440
 two outputs are installed 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.770
 the discharge of oil into the tank is indicated by the letter t of 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.860
 letters n this is taken the next 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.900
 distributor that is n well, most likely 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.570
 this is nix 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.570
 here in this wiring diagram now 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:56.030
 reset oil goes to gearbox 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.030
 now here is not yet fully implemented 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.939
 connection to a separate tank 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.920
 hydraulic which should be 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.620
 set in perspective this as 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.430
 the second stage will be 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.519
 hydraulics and now how would we go 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.680
 oils and dumping oil directly into 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.389
 tank why such a scheme is chosen here 3 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.579
 way valve one way valve 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.430
 distributors 20 ask a lot of questions 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.660
 why exactly here will explain 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.500
 most agricultural work 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.620
 performed 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:38.330
 this tractor is not used 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:42.419
 additional dispenser ie 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.310
 enough native enough 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.509
 distributor floating mode 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.729
 forced lowering too well for everything 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.280
 years of operation did not take that 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.199
 there is he somewhere may be involved 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:01.220
 on the front loader back plate 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:05.599
 which is installed by fittings 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:10.889
 quick connectors this connector 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:13.139
 production agroimpulse how are they themselves 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.610
 show in operation until it is unclear 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:21.560
 we will watch to see these 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:27.200
 a choke bottom also let down 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.000
 tube this tube and and here well since 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.950
 would not be very visible on something 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.980
 the depth goes it is the way out it is the way out 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.320
 staff distributor that is this one 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.790
 lamb that we twist lower and 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:48.650
 we are starting to work out but there is 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:51.380
 nuance some here ask why not 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.690
 this output works it starts working 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:01.130
 when the linkage is a native linkage completely 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:07.520
 omitted visible this highway and and I, too 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:10.540
 I decided to save, that is , I need it here 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:17.210
 additional distributor it 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.940
 working with a front loader he 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.070
 will be involved at work there with 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.360
 complex machine such as the map 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:29.090
 Pli combine that is not necessary 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.820
 chase maw constantly through it 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:38.150
 because with oil anyway goes 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:41.300
 shavings go quarreling goes all this 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.790
 even with very good filtering everything 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.240
 it is present in the oil that is superfluous 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.730
 since it didn't make sense anya through it 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.920
 the oil here is done here not 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.090
 parallel 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.040
 inconsistently rather a parallel 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.490
 connection system that is we can 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.110
 switch here to the distributor when 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.390
 we use directly or 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.110
 front loader or large 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:12.070
 the number of consumers than here it is possible and so 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.330
 here in brief about distributors 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:18.470
 metal tubes too initially 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.590
 are hoses that is, is not replaced 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.050
 on metal tubes 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.450
 This is a more reliable option but also managed 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.010
 avoid getting away from all these leaks 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.970
 who were here originally now 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.970
 the system is tight
