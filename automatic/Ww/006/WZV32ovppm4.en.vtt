I'm<00:01:38.300> dr.<00:01:38.600> Amin<00:01:39.020> I'm<00:01:39.170> with<00:01:39.380> Scott<00:01:39.710> Ian<00:01:39.980> again

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
I'm dr. Amin I'm with Scott Ian again

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.190 
I'm dr. Amin I'm with Scott Ian again
we're<00:01:40.580> playing<00:01:40.970> with<00:01:41.120> guitars<00:01:41.390> we<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.080> want

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
we're playing with guitars we now want

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.570 
we're playing with guitars we now want
to<00:01:42.290> talk<00:01:42.440> about<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.770> tension<00:01:43.160> in<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.340> string

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
to talk about the tension in the string

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.220 
to talk about the tension in the string
and<00:01:44.150> that's<00:01:44.510> his<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:44.750> things<00:01:45.050> up<00:01:45.200> here

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
and that's his little things up here

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.020 
and that's his little things up here
that<00:01:45.560> people<00:01:45.800> always<00:01:45.920> try<00:01:46.160> playing<00:01:46.430> with<00:01:46.730> for

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
that people always try playing with for

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.120 
that people always try playing with for
your<00:01:47.210> playing<00:01:47.690> guitar<00:01:48.080> they<00:01:48.800> think<00:01:49.070> they're

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
your playing guitar they think they're

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.500 
your playing guitar they think they're
being<00:01:49.280> funny<00:01:49.670> by<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:49.910> twist<00:01:50.920> yeah<00:01:51.920> yeah<00:01:52.880> yeahs

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
being funny by the twist yeah yeah yeahs

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.110 
being funny by the twist yeah yeah yeahs
what<00:01:53.720> these<00:01:53.840> two<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.080> rotate<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:55.000> rotates<00:01:56.000> on

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
what these two is rotate it rotates on

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.150 
what these two is rotate it rotates on
an<00:01:56.240> axis<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.990> geared<00:01:57.260> peg<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.710> it

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
an axis and it's a geared peg and it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.100 
an axis and it's a geared peg and it
raises<00:01:59.060> or<00:01:59.330> lowers<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.630> number<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.930> wraps

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
raises or lowers the number of wraps

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.170 
raises or lowers the number of wraps
you've<00:02:00.290> got<00:02:00.440> around<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.800> peg<00:02:00.980> up<00:02:01.100> there<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
you've got around the peg up there and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.950 
you've got around the peg up there and
so<00:02:02.960> I'm<00:02:03.440> going<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.620> tune<00:02:03.830> up<00:02:04.479> old<00:02:05.479> chaining

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so I'm going to tune up old chaining

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.370 
so I'm going to tune up old chaining
attention<00:02:06.530> making<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.670> greater<00:02:07.970> force<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
attention making a greater force and the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.199 
attention making a greater force and the
force<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.800> related<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.399> frequency<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
force is related to the frequency so the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.850 
force is related to the frequency so the
more<00:02:11.450> force<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.080> more<00:02:12.230> tension<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
more force the more tension in the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.980 
more force the more tension in the
string<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.580> faster<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.150> vibrates<00:02:14.600> that's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
string the faster it vibrates that's

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.949 
string the faster it vibrates that's
right<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.640> well<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> fact<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.120> faster<00:02:17.630> sound

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
right and well in fact the faster sound

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.170 
right and well in fact the faster sound
travels<00:02:18.530> through<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> oh<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.700> didn't<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
travels through it oh I didn't know that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.690 
travels through it oh I didn't know that
yeah<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.990> affects<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.830> speed<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
yeah it's it affects the speed of the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.910 
yeah it's it affects the speed of the
wave<00:02:22.910> itself<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> goes<00:02:24.440> through

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
wave itself and so it goes through

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040 
wave itself and so it goes through
faster<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> gets<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> end<00:02:26.570> comes<00:02:26.840> back

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
faster so it gets to the end comes back

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.199 
faster so it gets to the end comes back
there<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.860> back<00:02:28.040> back<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.400> back<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.060> it

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
there and back back and back and so it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.640 
there and back back and back and so it
goes<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.750> forth<00:02:29.810> faster<00:02:30.140> higher

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
goes back and forth faster higher

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.560 
goes back and forth faster higher
frequency<00:02:31.280> higher<00:02:31.640> pitch<00:02:31.910> yeah<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.360> we

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
frequency higher pitch yeah but we

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.850 
frequency higher pitch yeah but we
haven't<00:02:32.750> changed<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> string<00:02:33.470> length<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.770> we

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
haven't changed the string length and we

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.990 
haven't changed the string length and we
haven't<00:02:34.040> changed<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> mass<00:02:34.580> all<00:02:34.820> we've<00:02:34.970> done

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
haven't changed the mass all we've done

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.430 
haven't changed the mass all we've done
has<00:02:35.209> changed<00:02:35.270> attention<00:02:35.840> subject<00:02:36.170> we've<00:02:36.320> got

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
has changed attention subject we've got

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.870 
has changed attention subject we've got
one<00:02:36.620> variable<00:02:36.920> there's<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.340> girl<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.760> here's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
one variable there's the girl and here's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.750 
one variable there's the girl and here's
the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:38.090> one<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:41.060> all<00:02:42.220> musicians<00:02:43.220> have

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the other one now all musicians have

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.360 
the other one now all musicians have
certain<00:02:44.269> set<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.890> pitches<00:02:45.890> they<00:02:46.070> want<00:02:46.250> their

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
certain set of pitches they want their

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.050 
certain set of pitches they want their
instruments<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.300> by<00:02:47.570> burying<00:02:48.290> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
instruments to be and by burying this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.510 
instruments to be and by burying this
in<00:02:49.330> some<00:02:49.630> songs<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:50.680> change<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.130> tuning

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
in some songs you can change the tuning

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.790 
in some songs you can change the tuning
so<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.510> instead<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.780> playing<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.110> bar<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.680> can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
so that instead of playing a bar you can

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.729 
so that instead of playing a bar you can
just<00:02:53.980> play<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> basic<00:02:54.640> note<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.620> gives

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
just play the basic note but it gives

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.229 
just play the basic note but it gives
you<00:02:56.950> as<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.099> solo<00:02:57.430> guitar<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.000> gives<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.209> a

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
you as a solo guitar so it gives you a

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:06.120 
you as a solo guitar so it gives you a
lot<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.720> lot<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.110> noise<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.650> buck

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.339 

ok<00:03:07.239> now<00:03:08.239> another<00:03:08.270> thing<00:03:08.599> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:08.959> do<00:03:09.140> to

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
ok now another thing you can do to

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.500 
ok now another thing you can do to
change<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.920> detention<00:03:10.489> is<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:11.030> Benden<00:03:11.420> oh

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
change the detention is to Benden oh

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.970 
change the detention is to Benden oh
right<00:03:11.810> oh<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.080> right<00:03:12.200> yeah<00:03:12.500> I'm<00:03:12.770> bending

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
right oh that's right yeah I'm bending

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.280 
right oh that's right yeah I'm bending
it<00:03:13.130> up<00:03:13.250> show<00:03:13.430> spending<00:03:13.819> enough<00:03:14.030> well<00:03:14.420> if<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.870> put

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
it up show spending enough well if I put

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.360 
it up show spending enough well if I put
my<00:03:15.319> fingers<00:03:15.709> down<00:03:15.739> behind<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.280> frets<00:03:16.580> here

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
my fingers down behind the frets here

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.620 
my fingers down behind the frets here
static<00:03:19.370> I've<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.580> shorten<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.000> strings<00:03:20.270> but

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
static I've just shorten the strings but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.740 
static I've just shorten the strings but
if<00:03:20.750> i<00:03:20.810> push<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:25.000> what's<00:03:26.000> your<00:03:26.120> destruction<00:03:26.510> in

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
if i push one what's your destruction in

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.540 
if i push one what's your destruction in
changing<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.410> tension<00:03:27.860> there<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.340> actually

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
changing the tension there and actually

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.120 
changing the tension there and actually
when<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.849> set<00:03:29.150> up<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.330> fretted<00:03:29.690> instrument<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
when you set up a fretted instrument you

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.120 
when you set up a fretted instrument you
push<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.700> string<00:03:32.480> down<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.410> fret<00:03:33.680> you're

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
push the string down to the fret you're

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.800 
push the string down to the fret you're
actually<00:03:34.310> stretching<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> string<00:03:35.360> down<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
actually stretching the string down so

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.410 
actually stretching the string down so
you're<00:03:35.989> raising<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.400> 12th<00:03:38.090> fret<00:03:38.209> which

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
you're raising it so the 12th fret which

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.940 
you're raising it so the 12th fret which
should<00:03:38.600> be<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.080> exact<00:03:39.410> middle<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.830> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
should be that the exact middle of the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.070 
should be that the exact middle of the
string<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.459> actually<00:03:41.000> set<00:03:41.239> back<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> little<00:03:41.840> bit

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
string is actually set back a little bit

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.140 
string is actually set back a little bit
to<00:03:42.530> make<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.610> remember<00:03:44.120> they're

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
to make because you remember they're

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.880 
to make because you remember they're
vegetarians<00:03:44.870> was<00:03:44.989> your<00:03:45.140> adjusting<00:03:45.470> attention

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
vegetarians was your adjusting attention

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.350 
vegetarians was your adjusting attention
so<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.250> well-built<00:03:47.030> guitar<00:03:47.510> will<00:03:48.140> go<00:03:49.239> we<00:03:50.239> have

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
so a well-built guitar will go we have

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.000 
so a well-built guitar will go we have
the<00:03:50.420> same<00:03:50.630> note<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:51.019> badly<00:03:51.349> built<00:03:51.500> guitar<00:03:51.769> like
