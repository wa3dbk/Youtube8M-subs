cherish this one last butterfly
until<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.290> figure<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.559> how<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:41.070> some

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
until I can figure out how to make some

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.830 
until I can figure out how to make some
and<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> set<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.989> today

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
and that's what I set out to do today

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.790 
and that's what I set out to do today
but<00:00:46.039> it's<00:00:47.039> there<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.469> I

but it's there I have like that I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.790 
but it's there I have like that I
thought<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.610> tool<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.649> was

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
thought it was tool at first when I was

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
thought it was tool at first when I was
grabbing<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.610> supplies<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.270> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
grabbing some of my supplies but it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.709 
grabbing some of my supplies but it's
almost<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:56.180> pantyhose<00:00:58.760> hmm<00:01:02.570> exactly<00:01:03.570> but

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
almost like a pantyhose hmm exactly but

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
almost like a pantyhose hmm exactly but
I'll<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.250> stretchy<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'll use because it's it's stretchy like

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.850 
I'll use because it's it's stretchy like
that<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.840> students<00:01:07.200> formed<00:01:07.590> around<00:01:07.860> wire<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
that as students formed around wire and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.310 
that as students formed around wire and
in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:12.840> balled<00:01:13.110> up

and<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> angles<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.270> everything

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
and all the angles and everything

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.290 
and all the angles and everything
correctly<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.030> down<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> bottom<00:02:35.000> as<00:02:36.000> soon

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
correctly and down at the bottom as soon

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
correctly and down at the bottom as soon
as<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.959> done<00:02:37.530> wrapping<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.130> around<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
as I was done wrapping it around and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.300 
as I was done wrapping it around and
molding<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.240> around<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.870> piece<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.560> chipboard<00:02:40.800> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
molding it around a piece of chipboard I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
molding it around a piece of chipboard I
put<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> piece<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:43.940> score<00:02:44.940> tape<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.989> connect<00:02:46.350> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
put a piece of score tape to connect it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.940 
put a piece of score tape to connect it
at<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.070> very<00:02:47.250> at<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.270> very<00:02:48.480> bottom<00:02:48.890> down<00:02:49.890> here

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
at the very at the very bottom down here

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.449 
at the very at the very bottom down here
to<00:02:50.850> connect<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.450> two<00:02:51.780> pieces<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.290> wire<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
to connect the two pieces of wire and

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.910 
to connect the two pieces of wire and
then<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.420> took<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.050> used<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.739> bit<00:02:55.830> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
then I took and used a little bit of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.890 
then I took and used a little bit of
cross<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.280> accidents<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.690> wire

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
cross the accidents just on the wire

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.050 
cross the accidents just on the wire
after<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.830> had<00:02:59.010> taken<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.489> off<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
after I had taken it off with the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
after I had taken it off with the
chipboard<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> wire<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:04.080> took<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
chipboard just on the wire I took and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.430 
chipboard just on the wire I took and
covered<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.880> tool<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:10.170> come<00:03:10.320> out

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
covered it with this tool it come out

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.710 
covered it with this tool it come out
comes<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> roll<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> came

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
comes on a roll and I think that it came

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.470 
comes on a roll and I think that it came
from<00:03:12.750> Michaels<00:03:13.410> oh<00:03:14.450> yeah<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.720> did<00:03:17.239> but<00:03:18.239> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
from Michaels oh yeah it did but I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.100 
from Michaels oh yeah it did but I
covered<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.049> on<00:03:19.260> one<00:03:20.040> side<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.780> I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
covered it on one side and then I

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.910 
covered it on one side and then I
flipped<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.769> over<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:24.110> covered<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.410> it's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
flipped it over and covered it on it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.789 
flipped it over and covered it on it's
more<00:03:26.280> glossy<00:03:26.459> accents<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.560> covered<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.680> on

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
more glossy accents and covered it on

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.910 
more glossy accents and covered it on
the<00:03:28.950> backside<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.170> there<00:03:31.170> was<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> double<00:03:31.709> layer

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the backside so there was a double layer

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.160 
the backside so there was a double layer
of<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.790> tick<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> piece

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
of this and then a tick and on a piece

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.110 
of this and then a tick and on a piece
of<00:03:37.200> wax<00:03:37.500> pot<00:03:37.799> placed<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.610> then<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
of wax pot placed all that then on a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.490 
of wax pot placed all that then on a
piece<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.420> wax<00:03:39.720> paper<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:42.350> started<00:03:43.350> filling

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
piece of wax paper and I started filling

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.220 
piece of wax paper and I started filling
in<00:03:43.739> with<00:03:43.829> glossy<00:03:44.250> accents<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.780> probably

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
in with glossy accents this is probably

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.490 
in with glossy accents this is probably
a<00:03:46.320> step<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.799> should<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:48.049> not<00:03:49.049> done<00:03:49.260> because

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
a step I should have not done because

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.880 
a step I should have not done because
stuff's<00:03:50.370> expensive<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:52.380> took<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.650> lot<00:03:52.829> of

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
stuff's expensive and it took a lot of

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.770 
stuff's expensive and it took a lot of
it<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.700> step<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.269> shouldn't<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.690> done

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
it the step that I shouldn't have done

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.690 
it the step that I shouldn't have done
was<00:03:55.200> fitting<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.040> piece<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.400> wax<00:03:56.579> paper

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
was fitting it on a piece of wax paper

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.080 
was fitting it on a piece of wax paper
because<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.540> went<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.560> pull<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.860> off<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.820> part

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
because I went to pull it off here part

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.170 
because I went to pull it off here part
of<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:01.010> remained<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> wax<00:04:02.430> paper<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:03.000> you

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
of it remained on the wax paper as you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.509 
of it remained on the wax paper as you
can<00:04:03.329> see<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.780> where<00:04:03.989> all<00:04:04.079> these<00:04:04.519> different

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
can see that's where all these different

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.560 
can see that's where all these different
variations<00:04:06.120> in<00:04:06.329> color<00:04:06.480> comes<00:04:06.900> from<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:09.150> when<00:04:09.540> I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
variations in color comes from so when I

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.270 
variations in color comes from so when I
pull<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.930> off<00:04:10.049> there<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.500> those<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.920> was<00:04:11.010> still

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
pull it off there and those it was still

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.199 
pull it off there and those it was still
kind<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.670> flimsy<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.170> put<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:15.030> my

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
kind of flimsy so I put it on that's my

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.469 
kind of flimsy so I put it on that's my
flipped<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.109> over<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:17.539> used<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:20.329> couple<00:04:21.329> of

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
flipped it over and used a couple of

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.270 
flipped it over and used a couple of
pieces<00:04:21.720> of

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
pieces of

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.770 
pieces of
cardstock<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.490> had<00:04:24.730> was<00:04:25.060> really<00:04:25.630> just

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
cardstock that I had was really just

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.510 
cardstock that I had was really just
printing<00:04:26.170> paper<00:04:26.380> but<00:04:26.740> that's<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:27.040> double<00:04:27.340> layer

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
printing paper but that's a double layer

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.440 
printing paper but that's a double layer
of<00:04:28.560> printed<00:04:29.560> paper<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:31.090> then<00:04:32.790> I've<00:04:33.790> not<00:04:34.210> cut

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
of printed paper and then I've not cut

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.280 
of printed paper and then I've not cut
it<00:04:34.600> out<00:04:34.750> yet<00:04:35.580> I've<00:04:36.580> not<00:04:36.790> kept<00:04:37.240> my<00:04:37.330> I've<00:04:38.020> still

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
it out yet I've not kept my I've still

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.220 
it out yet I've not kept my I've still
have<00:04:38.470> all<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.710> my<00:04:39.010> tool<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.960> everything<00:04:40.960> I

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
have all of my tool and everything I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.110 
have all of my tool and everything I
wanted<00:04:41.590> everything<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:42.010> dry<00:04:42.310> really<00:04:42.790> good

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
wanted everything to dry really good

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.650 
wanted everything to dry really good
first<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.780> then<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.620> covered<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.070> with<00:04:45.660> Mod

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
first and then it covered it with Mod

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.820 
first and then it covered it with Mod
Podge<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:48.360> where<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.450> would<00:04:49.600> definitely<00:04:50.380> have

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
Podge to where it would definitely have

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.610 
Podge to where it would definitely have
a<00:04:50.860> good<00:04:51.100> hold<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:52.110> then<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.139> hit<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.470> with
