hey guys got back just tried out the EIC
citronella<00:01:08.060> plus<00:01:08.390> wristband<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.970> initially

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
citronella plus wristband so initially

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.690 
citronella plus wristband so initially
this<00:01:12.110> band<00:01:12.440> is<00:01:12.590> actually<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.950> little<00:01:13.310> hard<00:01:13.520> to

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
this band is actually a little hard to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.960 
this band is actually a little hard to
put<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:13.910> yourself<00:01:15.370> because<00:01:16.370> it<00:01:16.610> needs<00:01:16.760> this

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
put on yourself because it needs this

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.690 
put on yourself because it needs this
little<00:01:17.300> tab<00:01:17.960> where<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.470> stick<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.430> into<00:01:19.550> the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
little tab where you stick it into the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.920 
little tab where you stick it into the
hole<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.500> mean<00:01:21.680> it's<00:01:21.830> not<00:01:21.890> impossible

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
hole but I mean it's not impossible

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.920 
hole but I mean it's not impossible
can<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.110> try<00:01:24.260> that<00:01:24.290> again<00:01:25.270> yeah<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.540> little<00:01:26.810> bit

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
can we try that again yeah a little bit

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.790 
can we try that again yeah a little bit
hard<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.320> put<00:01:27.470> on

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
hard to put on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.460 
hard to put on
we<00:01:28.430> got<00:01:28.580> lucky<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.940> first<00:01:29.180> time<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.660> in

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
we got lucky that first time and in

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.530 
we got lucky that first time and in
terms<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.800> effectiveness<00:01:31.420> actually<00:01:32.420> got<00:01:32.510> a

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
terms of effectiveness actually got a

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.670 
terms of effectiveness actually got a
bite<00:01:33.229> right<00:01:33.380> here<00:01:33.620> on<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> back<00:01:35.470> granted<00:01:36.470> I

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
bite right here on the back granted I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.100 
bite right here on the back granted I
don't<00:01:37.520> know<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.850> might<00:01:38.540> need<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.690> put<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:38.900> on<00:01:38.990> my

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
don't know I might need to put one on my

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.910 
don't know I might need to put one on my
shoulder<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:39.590> then<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.009> won't<00:01:40.070> even<00:01:40.250> fit<00:01:40.369> so

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
shoulder but then it won't even fit so

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.770 
shoulder but then it won't even fit so
and<00:01:42.920> initially<00:01:43.790> -<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.270> didn't<00:01:44.509> really<00:01:44.660> have

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and initially - this didn't really have

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.520 
and initially - this didn't really have
a<00:01:44.810> strong<00:01:45.369> smell<00:01:46.750> right<00:01:47.750> even<00:01:48.080> when<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.229> opened

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
a strong smell right even when I opened

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.040 
a strong smell right even when I opened
the<00:01:48.590> package<00:01:48.910> might<00:01:49.910> be<00:01:50.119> because<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.750> maybe

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
the package might be because it maybe

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.480 
the package might be because it maybe
leaks<00:01:51.350> out<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.650> cardboard<00:01:51.950> backing<00:01:52.220> or

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
leaks out of the cardboard backing or

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.190 
leaks out of the cardboard backing or
something<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.300> actually<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:53.750> not<00:01:53.960> very

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
something this actually was not very

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.190 
something this actually was not very
effective<00:01:55.270> P<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.300> see<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.840> listening<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
effective P I see if it listening to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.180 
effective P I see if it listening to
