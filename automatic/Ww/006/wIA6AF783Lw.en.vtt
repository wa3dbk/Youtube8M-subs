into<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> field<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.770> on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
into the field to see what is going on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
into the field to see what is going on
and<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.430> able<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.820> connect<00:01:03.239> these

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and to be able to connect these

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.410 
and to be able to connect these
scientific<00:01:04.170> principles<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.309> design<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
been made in places like Germany the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
been made in places like Germany the
Netherlands<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.780> Japan<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.619> we'll<00:01:13.799> be

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
Netherlands and Japan so we'll be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
Netherlands and Japan so we'll be

now<00:01:20.640> they're<00:01:21.060> made

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
now they're made

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.929 
now they're made
on<00:01:22.060> their<00:01:22.240> own<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.500> even<00:01:23.890> without<00:01:24.039> government

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
on their own so even without government

on their own so even without government
impetus<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.380> know<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.810> I

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
impetus so it's you know it's here I

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.859 
impetus so it's you know it's here I
like<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.590> very<00:01:32.860> interactive<00:01:33.689> classroom<00:01:34.689> and

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
like a very interactive classroom and

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.450 
like a very interactive classroom and
that's<00:01:35.020> one<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.500> reasons<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.009> we<00:01:36.219> set

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
that's one of the reasons that we set

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.880 
that's one of the reasons that we set
aside<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.090> second<00:01:37.539> day<00:01:37.689> for<00:01:38.110> truly

aside the second day for truly
interactive<00:01:39.569> discussion<00:01:40.569> and<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.560> do<00:01:41.799> work<00:01:42.069> as

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
interactive discussion and we do work as

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.059 
interactive discussion and we do work as
teams<00:01:42.909> often<00:01:43.920> collaborating<00:01:44.920> with<00:01:44.950> each

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
teams often collaborating with each

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.450 
teams often collaborating with each

other and coming up with creative
designs<00:01:48.969> so<00:01:49.299> this<00:01:49.479> introduction<00:01:49.929> might<00:01:50.229> be

my<00:01:57.880> parents<00:01:58.149> were<00:01:58.539> scientists<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.329> was

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
my parents were scientists and I was

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.830 
my parents were scientists and I was
interested<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.110> natural<00:02:02.259> science<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.659> was

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
interested in natural science but I was

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
interested in natural science but I was
also<00:02:05.020> very<00:02:05.259> interested<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.890> art<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.520> it's

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
also very interested in art and it's

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.610 
also very interested in art and it's
it's<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.759> discipline<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.269> combines<00:02:10.840> both<00:02:11.260> and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
it's a discipline that combines both and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.410 
it's a discipline that combines both and
I<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:15.220> fascinating<00:02:15.489> for<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.239> reason

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
I think it's fascinating for that reason

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.890 
I think it's fascinating for that reason
and<00:02:16.690> i<00:02:16.810> think<00:02:17.079> you<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.709> humans<00:02:18.900> are

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and i think you know humans are

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.140 
and i think you know humans are
naturally<00:02:20.230> most<00:02:20.829> humans<00:02:21.280> are<00:02:21.400> interested<00:02:22.030> in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
naturally most humans are interested in

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.589 
naturally most humans are interested in
both<00:02:22.420> science<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.590> art<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.180> what<00:02:25.420> this

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
both science and art and so what this

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.259 
both science and art and so what this
course<00:02:25.959> actually<00:02:26.260> tries<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.549> integrate

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
course actually tries to do is integrate

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.630 
course actually tries to do is integrate
the<00:02:28.600> two
