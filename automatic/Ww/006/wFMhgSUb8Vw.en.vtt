00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.440
 once again attending a call from a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.400
 client complaining here creation of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.000
 shower 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:23.779
 he was coming out smoke on fire 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.779
 here making you show 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.780
 residence but we do not have a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:29.700
 distribution we simply have a network 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:46.280
 that comes from the default input pattern was 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:49.280
 done correctly is completely 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280
 wrong 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.330
 the excess energy consumption also 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.220
 taking advantage that we have here a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 thing to say that is a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.050
 system tool 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.980
 symbolizing a shower 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.280
 in fact this is a totally 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.750
 outside of reality it is not in this way 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:54.520
 what should be done 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:03:01.180
 I've seen many situations on top of the video 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:04.980
 Actually, modern is not for you. 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.540
 take advantage of this is not the correct way 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:17.610
 will do training in your home and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:17.610
 will guide you through and finish 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:32.560
 calling the right people is going to be 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.440
 placed next to a frame of 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:42.730
 distribution and actually pay only that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.810
 that you can hug everyone and even the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.230
 next 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 thanks
