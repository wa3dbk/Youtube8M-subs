00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.939
 arnhem I'm going to see a quick chat 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.229

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 and of course the best you have with your job 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.949

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.439
 look i would have knocked over pro forma cold church watch newcastle you never have 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.159
 60 points 7 goals and I have a device with a C label 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.420
 I have a good plan 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 manchester hereafter you work 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.500
 oeroeg here you see 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.040
 watch it yourself 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 your child's pop princess trap and 10 10 won 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.660
 well that's not luck 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.710
 I like that very much 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.120
 i say right 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.580
 of course with a few good player but a fact that scores 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.510
 and india i will first show you what the bullying has to do 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.850
 So 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.840
 in 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.120
 then you must have 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.620
 r 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.860
 that now everything is the best player 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 at the orphan here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.800
 svm 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.330
 but I can go on your own sometimes 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.010
 I am already dating I am best but buy this text the first training day 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.020
 want to stay 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.290
 I'm already with the plans 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.370
 abuja best players out to the army a meal 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.690
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.870
 tactics 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.990
 yeah that's apparently normal it is actually every playing style argues optics 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 you have to play hard alfie best in extremis rate 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.230
 shoot from a distance 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.960
 Then it should also always be in the midfield cents to make them too fat 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.270
 at least some more of the perpetrators ordinary man midfielders on the attack that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.490
 Thinking as a football fan, every chance is a bit of a profession 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.300
 then I did billions of credit no more goals fall therefore was the top five 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.830
 in the fourth inning 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.739
 winterswijk therefore completely behind a large intestine miss that stop 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.239
 the same applies to the number continues to decline 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.790
 mandekking seems logical to me I can hardly apply on my list 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.309
 the judges take the offside trap 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.369
 I also hear the odds of 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.559
 or why 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:25.959
 tiscali 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.119
 and zombies 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.839
 it is yes it just may not be mentality yes defensive 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.189
 I have this to stand multiple I do not care much construction pace 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.909
 how green and yellow I had to be open to his blackpool 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.909
 we just play 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.109
 just after a zero percent 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.339
 pay like this 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.679
 r yes it was kind of like that 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.689
 i know salazar i have top performance minke smabers 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.459
 it seems like a faltering very strong defensive play, but then it must be 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.199
 if you let more money and valuable go 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.409
 yes i hope the parties will help a lot 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.729
 and you 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:10.649
 maybe see it in the shape of youtube video to shoot into ices 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.639
