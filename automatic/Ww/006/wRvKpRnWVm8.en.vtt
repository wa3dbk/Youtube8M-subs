this<00:00:01.520> video<00:00:01.880> will<00:00:02.179> compare<00:00:02.570> and<00:00:02.690> contrast<00:00:02.780> the

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:03.409 
this video will compare and contrast the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.340 
this video will compare and contrast the
two<00:00:03.439> types<00:00:03.889> of<00:00:04.130> smooth<00:00:04.549> muscle<00:00:05.020> single<00:00:06.020> unit

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
two types of smooth muscle single unit

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.100 
two types of smooth muscle single unit
also<00:00:06.950> known<00:00:07.190> as<00:00:07.520> visceral<00:00:07.970> smooth<00:00:08.510> muscle<00:00:08.900> and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
also known as visceral smooth muscle and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.640 
also known as visceral smooth muscle and
multi<00:00:09.980> unit<00:00:10.660> multi<00:00:11.660> unit<00:00:11.990> is<00:00:12.110> in<00:00:12.290> the<00:00:12.320> first

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
multi unit multi unit is in the first

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.070 
multi unit multi unit is in the first
column<00:00:12.889> single<00:00:13.820> unit<00:00:14.179> is<00:00:14.299> in<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:14.690> second

column single unit is in the second
column<00:00:15.910> single<00:00:16.910> unit<00:00:17.210> again<00:00:17.690> is<00:00:18.020> also<00:00:18.380> called

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
column single unit again is also called

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.519 
column single unit again is also called
visceral<00:00:19.190> smooth<00:00:19.820> muscle<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:20.990> be<00:00:21.170> sure<00:00:21.199> you

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
visceral smooth muscle so be sure you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.099 
visceral smooth muscle so be sure you
know<00:00:21.710> single<00:00:22.250> unit<00:00:22.609> as<00:00:22.730> visceral<00:00:23.269> smooth<00:00:23.779> and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
know single unit as visceral smooth and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.179 
know single unit as visceral smooth and
use<00:00:24.710> those<00:00:24.920> terms<00:00:25.279> interchangeably<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:27.189> let's

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
use those terms interchangeably so let's

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.800 
use those terms interchangeably so let's
take<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.369> look<00:00:28.609> at<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.849> difference<00:00:29.269> between

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
take a look at the difference between

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.340 
take a look at the difference between
these<00:00:30.320> two<00:00:30.619> types<00:00:30.920> of<00:00:31.070> smooth<00:00:31.340> muscle<00:00:32.170> we<00:00:33.170> will

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
these two types of smooth muscle we will

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.900 
these two types of smooth muscle we will
do<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:33.920> by<00:00:34.130> looking<00:00:34.160> at<00:00:34.610> several

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
do this by looking at several

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.069 
do this by looking at several
characteristics<00:00:36.340> first<00:00:37.780> multi-unit<00:00:38.780> smooth

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
characteristics first multi-unit smooth

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.010 
characteristics first multi-unit smooth
muscle<00:00:39.469> functions<00:00:40.250> as<00:00:40.550> discrete<00:00:41.360> functional

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
muscle functions as discrete functional

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.319 
muscle functions as discrete functional
units<00:00:43.149> so<00:00:44.149> that<00:00:44.360> means<00:00:44.690> each<00:00:45.289> muscle<00:00:45.920> fiber

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
units so that means each muscle fiber

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.600 
units so that means each muscle fiber
contracts<00:00:47.410> independently<00:00:48.410> of<00:00:48.649> all<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.399> other

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
contracts independently of all the other

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.420 
contracts independently of all the other
fibers<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.480> that<00:00:51.379> similar<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.860> skeletal

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
fibers is that similar to skeletal

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.950 
fibers is that similar to skeletal
muscle<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.440> answer<00:00:54.770> is<00:00:54.890> yes<00:00:55.960> remember

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
muscle the answer is yes remember

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.139 
muscle the answer is yes remember
skeletal<00:00:57.620> muscles<00:00:57.949> have<00:00:58.160> motor<00:00:58.370> neurons<00:00:58.850> that

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
skeletal muscles have motor neurons that

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.830 
skeletal muscles have motor neurons that
tell<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.620> fiber<00:01:00.949> over<00:01:01.219> here<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:02.149> contract<00:01:02.570> on

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
tell this fiber over here to contract on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.770 
tell this fiber over here to contract on
a<00:01:02.920> motor<00:01:03.920> neuron<00:01:04.190> over<00:01:04.549> here<00:01:05.030> telling<00:01:05.479> this

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
a motor neuron over here telling this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.580 
a motor neuron over here telling this
muscle<00:01:06.200> fiber<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.650> contract<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.170> these<00:01:09.170> muscle

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
muscle fiber to contract so these muscle

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.679 
muscle fiber to contract so these muscle
fibers<00:01:09.619> are<00:01:10.100> contracting<00:01:10.700> independently<00:01:11.540> of

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
fibers are contracting independently of

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.539 
fibers are contracting independently of
each<00:01:11.810> other<00:01:13.450> multi<00:01:14.450> unit<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.740> same<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.400> is

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
each other multi unit is the same and is

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.800 
each other multi unit is the same and is
therefore<00:01:16.900> neurogenic<00:01:17.900> what's<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.710> mean

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
therefore neurogenic what's that mean

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.359 
therefore neurogenic what's that mean
remember<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.930> break<00:01:21.110> down<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.470> words<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
suffix genic means producing so what is

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.380 
suffix genic means producing so what is

those<00:02:30.769> are<00:02:30.980> goosebumps<00:02:31.549> right<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.780> goosebumps

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
those are goosebumps right so goosebumps

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.270 
those are goosebumps right so goosebumps
are<00:02:33.500> caused<00:02:33.739> by<00:02:34.040> multi-unit<00:02:34.760> smooth<00:02:35.030> muscle

are not self excitable this should make

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.129 
are not self excitable this should make
sense<00:03:03.349> because<00:03:03.799> they<00:03:04.340> are<00:03:04.400> neurogenic<00:03:05.239> they

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
sense because they are neurogenic they

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.550 
sense because they are neurogenic they
rely<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.739> neuron<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.609> tell<00:03:08.299> them<00:03:09.260> to

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.899 
rely on a neuron to tell them to
contract<00:03:09.889> so<00:03:10.840> these<00:03:11.840> cells<00:03:12.650> are<00:03:13.010> not<00:03:13.370> self

muscle<00:03:28.329> alright<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:29.959> now<00:03:30.109> let's<00:03:30.139> compare

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
muscle alright so now let's compare

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.770 
muscle alright so now let's compare
those<00:03:31.010> characteristics<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.180> single-unit

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
those characteristics to single-unit

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.979 
those characteristics to single-unit
smooth<00:03:33.199> muscle<00:03:33.590> which<00:03:34.209> remember<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.389> also

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
smooth muscle which remember is also

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.640 
smooth muscle which remember is also
called<00:03:36.260> visceral<00:03:36.980> smooth<00:03:37.430> muscle<00:03:38.650> so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
called visceral smooth muscle so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.199 
called visceral smooth muscle so
single-unit<00:03:40.160> smooth<00:03:40.549> muscle<00:03:40.910> becomes

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
single-unit smooth muscle becomes

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.759 
single-unit smooth muscle becomes

mom<00:04:24.740> happy<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.900> single-unit<00:04:27.410> smooth<00:04:27.740> muscle

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
mom happy the single-unit smooth muscle

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.950 
mom happy the single-unit smooth muscle
of<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.310> uterus<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.940> an<00:04:29.120> example<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.780> a

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
of the uterus is an example of a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.380 
of the uterus is an example of a
functional<00:04:30.500> syncytium<00:04:30.970> because<00:04:31.970> all<00:04:32.360> of

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
functional syncytium because all of

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.120 
functional syncytium because all of
those<00:04:32.600> muscle<00:04:33.050> cells<00:04:33.320> together<00:04:33.620> will

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
those muscle cells together will

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.060 
those muscle cells together will
function<00:04:34.580> as<00:04:34.730> one<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.360> therefore<00:04:36.290> one<00:04:36.590> huge

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
function as one and therefore one huge

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.240 
function as one and therefore one huge
contraction<00:04:37.850> can<00:04:38.030> occur<00:04:38.360> all<00:04:38.630> at<00:04:38.660> once<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:40.070> it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
contraction can occur all at once so it

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.100 
contraction can occur all at once so it
makes<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.850> easier<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.390> mom<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.680> give<00:04:42.890> birth

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
makes it easier on mom to give birth

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.600 
makes it easier on mom to give birth
this<00:04:45.110> means<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.590> single-unit<00:04:46.250> smooth

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
this means that single-unit smooth

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.400 
this means that single-unit smooth
muscle<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:47.270> myogenic<00:04:48.370> which<00:04:49.370> means<00:04:49.640> what

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
muscle is myogenic which means what

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.200 
muscle is myogenic which means what
remember<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.530> break<00:04:51.710> down<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.040> word<00:04:52.220> genic

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
remember to break down the word genic

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.190 
remember to break down the word genic
means<00:04:53.960> producing<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.250> Myo<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:57.250> muscle

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
means producing and Myo is muscle

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.540 
means producing and Myo is muscle
therefore<00:05:00.200> it's<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.620> muscle<00:05:01.100> cells<00:05:01.370> that

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
therefore it's the muscle cells that

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.170 
therefore it's the muscle cells that
initiate<00:05:02.300> contraction<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.700> let's<00:05:04.700> say<00:05:04.940> it's

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
initiate contraction and let's say it's

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.780

this muscle cell here that initiates

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.780 
this muscle cell here that initiates
contraction<00:05:08.510> how<00:05:09.320> does<00:05:09.560> this<00:05:09.890> next<00:05:10.340> cell

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
contraction how does this next cell
receive<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:12.020> message<00:05:13.540> through<00:05:14.540> gap

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
receive that message through gap

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.390 
receive that message through gap
junctions<00:05:14.840> that's<00:05:15.770> correct

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400

see<00:05:17.000> how<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.330> two<00:05:17.570> go<00:05:17.810> hand-in-hand<00:05:18.260> if<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
see how the two go hand-in-hand if the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.060 
see how the two go hand-in-hand if the
muscle<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.240> myogenic<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:21.230> will<00:05:21.620> have<00:05:21.830> gap

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
muscle is myogenic it will have gap

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.570 
muscle is myogenic it will have gap

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
junctions if it is neurogenic there is

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.290 
junctions if it is neurogenic there is
no<00:05:25.790> need<00:05:26.090> for<00:05:26.510> gap<00:05:27.020> junctions<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.970> where<00:05:29.180> in

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
no need for gap junctions so where in

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.090 
no need for gap junctions so where in
the<00:05:29.360> body<00:05:29.570> would<00:05:29.750> one<00:05:30.140> find<00:05:30.169> single-unit
