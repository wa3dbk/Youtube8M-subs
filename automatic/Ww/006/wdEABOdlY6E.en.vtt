00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.750
 I'm going to start recipe by hitting two eggs 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.400
 always good to give a beat before 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.770
 put the other ingredients 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.590
 after a little tap if the eggs 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.450
 now I'll put a tablespoon of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.450
 margarine I'm using pulses to 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.989
 beat along with sugar 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:39.020
 mix these three ingredients 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:42.350
 first here and mix all 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.760
 ingredients I will now put the cream of the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.269
 mixture of the first cream and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.340
 It was so good liquid, you see. 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.780
 to do is step by step will mix all 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.960
 ingredients together because the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.079
 wafer it is mass delicate girl 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.519
 so it will not put everything in the bowl and 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.320
 mix it all together 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.440
 but as I did it will do the bit 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.050
 and then he looks like and now to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.090
 I'll put the maize in the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.550
 corn level up and help in hand and already 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.450
 I'll also enjoy putting the yeast 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.980
 in powder 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.320
 I'm only using a spoon as well. 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:30.020
 and now you have to mix these 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.950
 or mixing thus complete to dissolve 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.950
 well in the ingredients 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:46.000
 there and adding a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:47.590
 A little here I added all the starch 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.440
 of corn already good 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.450
 whoever is neglecting the hand does not 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.460
 can put a lot of corn man because 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 if it is not there the staff gets very hard 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.990
 then judo of the hand 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.810
 Then you have stopped adding the starch. 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.390
 There's got to be corn now. 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.460
 modeling has now been modeling and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.700
 little of the mass and robot like this with the hand 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.950
 until I get to the people I want and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 now has to cut equally because in the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.970
 time to bake it makes the difference if 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 very uneven size so you 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 seek to cut the size more or less 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 equal 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:31.360
 Then I get this handle. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 so I'm going to put it in the middle 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.110
 chocolate 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.760
 I put more or less like 15 and the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:45.190
 body here, but it can be 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:53.220
 big also there closes like it was rolling 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 so they all in this format so 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.030
 I'm making this size you can 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 make size bigger too and now to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.170
 put in the way you placed the paper 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.030
 butter down but do not need 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.730
 put but I put here if not him 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.209
 breaking the image below and then gets 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.120
 I like bad things, he does not stick 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.180
 shape if you do not put the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.239
 But she's better off with 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
 paper-butter so you, so here I 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.650
 I call everyone and now I step one 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.590
 car teaches only got more beautiful together 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.400
 with cat is always easy a little bit of 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.269
 me 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.829
 no one because he sticks then passing 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:39.010
 so for more than a year he has not 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:41.890
 called a lot to pass everybody like this is 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.409
 that I have already done all and surrendered the 117 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.689
 in this format that I did and now I'm going 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.810
 to pass can not pass 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.459
 It was very hot and he quickly threatened. 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.549
 So now I'm going to take it to know that it's a 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.950
 little more the way it was is that it 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.900
 already they all took more or less 25 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.329
 minutes of my forum there will depend not 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.819
 It was one of you, but it's very quickly to 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.180
 from a double down and you 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.739
 they had it because it's good to take 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.530
 leaf you expect to cool to power 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.650
 take because otherwise there what is pathogenic 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.530
 and then when you become homeless on paper 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.699
 people are already good and still part of him 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.229
 it gets so burnt 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:27.580
 He can stay like this, I'll cut with the 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.169
 The girl who stayed inside is by 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.400
 inside she stays all this way 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.289
 dismantling 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.010
 then you have to take more care 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.110
 wafer and the chocolate drops here 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.090
 you do not want to put do not need 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.590
 but it gives a very special flavor 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.780
 it was really tasty 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.199
 and then the recipe stays so I hope 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:52.150
 Can you do it at home? It 's very easy. 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:54.720
 to do and I hope you enjoy and 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.720
 see you later
