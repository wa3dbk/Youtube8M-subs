00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:12.259
 today will be transportbox tv and indeed 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:16.340
 Today speed to speech clock to the 50 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.010
 arization mike michel weber we have 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.430
 both picchu us looked at and 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.830
 Although the adidas f50 arisierung is new 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.730
 in the fifth generation from high light 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.650
 touch material 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.770
 I have a separate school 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.509
 presented as he 50 I link you 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.980
 The shoes are also pure that is 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.050
 We are not specific to the shoes 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.030
 one only on the comparison 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.079
 the human clock what to train at both 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.210
 Together the 50 and the merial come 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.399
 with a rather narrow silhouette 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.460
 that means they are football boots for 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.070
 slim feet both shoes also feature 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.950
 above a light weight so lighter 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.380
 Other shoes are lightweight 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.050
 sees the respective he of the manufacturer 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.230
 that is the 50 is the high 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.659
 voltage of the adidas with consists of 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 terrain material 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.400
 it is both a material forward 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 attached what third text is called or 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.590
 what acc means that means they should too 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.790
 occupation is also very good 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.860
 to be able to control 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.229
 Both shoes are different because 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 relatively low as you can see 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 both the material at 50 as well as at 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 Welper it really ultra-soft 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.729
 this is a thin insert 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
 material we have both shoes 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.840
 once a picchu 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.409
 that is a shallow laces and 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.600
 we each have a pretty light weight 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.350
 construction what the tabs also 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.720
 put both shoes down on speed that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.580
 means we already have the for fast 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 intended players are so very good 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.600
 can take off and especially good 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.049
 from the spot comes main difference 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.070
 Of course, the weight of the shoe 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.250
 I'm vague about that now 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.439
 provided he is here so you can see this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.509
 could read the following me 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:11.030
 put the school on first and leave 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.410
 then the weight of the medium shows 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 you then so far 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.590
 has been determined once in front 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.960
 mixed 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.330
 if i take uvek now you show 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.660
 the court in front 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:32.770
 and as you can see, nature comes up with something 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.770
 we did not read here 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.860
 165 5 grams 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.220
 I hope it beautifully something once 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.220
 on 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.210
 the 50 years zero in the new fifth 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.040
 version as I said hey bitch material 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.760
 also the shoe for another shoe once and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.760
 we have 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:11.390
 205 grams as you can see 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.240
 25 grams and so is the f50 in the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.220
 new series in the new lightweight design 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.560
 but a little heavier or say 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.610
 heavier than the Munich riva for the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.530
 future we are doing now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.200
 different or more frequently comma 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.570
 Videos of what weight never concerns me 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 the size 8 or the size eight and a half 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.320
 its a few grams then maximum 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.990
 difference but if you are with us 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.780
 weight lines always look oh or 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.630
 eight and a half, of course, the question to you 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.510
 which game do you see here in front 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.180
 puppy or in the 50 let me 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.459
 know below about the commons and then 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.459
 The sport box remains sporty
