00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
did get a little Pollack lad here I
don't<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> those<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.360> Wheaties<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
don't think any of those are Wheaties I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
don't think any of those are Wheaties I
did<00:01:19.590> save<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.310> found<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
did save one that I found it was a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
did save one that I found it was a
little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.030> deeper<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.479> Claude<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.110> um

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
little bit deeper in this Claude but um

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890 
little bit deeper in this Claude but um
it<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.430> where<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> tree<00:01:24.720> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it was around where a tree was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770 
it was around where a tree was
previously<00:01:25.350> mulched<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.220> uh<00:01:26.299> I'm<00:01:27.299> assuming

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
previously mulched so uh I'm assuming

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
previously mulched so uh I'm assuming
it's<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.590> memorial<00:01:28.950> but

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it's just going to be in a memorial but

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:39.370 
it's just going to be in a memorial but
it<00:01:29.340> could<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> week<00:01:29.820> let's<00:01:30.060> check<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> out

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.020 

I'll<00:01:39.950> clean<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.219> up<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.520> show<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:40.790> thought

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
I'll clean it up and show you I thought

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.959 
I'll clean it up and show you I thought
almost<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.810> almost<00:01:41.840> looks<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.409> says<00:01:42.969> 195

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
almost it almost looks like it says 195

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.789 
almost it almost looks like it says 195
something<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:44.539> that<00:01:44.600> uh<00:01:44.719> that<00:01:45.110> could<00:01:45.649> be<00:01:45.770> a

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
something so that uh that could be a

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.620 
something so that uh that could be a
weedy<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:46.759> like<00:01:46.939> i<00:01:47.000> said<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:47.240> really<00:01:47.450> muddy

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
weedy but like i said it's really muddy

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.740 
weedy but like i said it's really muddy
you<00:01:47.780> can't<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.079> see<00:01:48.289> anything<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.770> these

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
you can't really see anything on these

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.980 
you can't really see anything on these
so<00:01:50.750> cool<00:01:51.789> actually<00:01:52.789> looks<00:01:53.179> like<00:01:53.299> a<00:01:53.360> 195

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
so cool actually looks like a 195

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.770 
so cool actually looks like a 195
something<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:54.679> uh<00:01:54.710> let<00:01:55.549> me<00:01:55.579> get<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:55.880> pile<00:01:56.630> of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
something so uh let me get this pile of

deteriorate<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.810> that<00:04:00.110> there<00:04:00.350> probably<00:04:00.880> was

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
deteriorate on that there probably was

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.450 
deteriorate on that there probably was
in<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.120> ground<00:04:02.360> since<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.780> 70s<00:04:03.320> um<00:04:03.590> actually
