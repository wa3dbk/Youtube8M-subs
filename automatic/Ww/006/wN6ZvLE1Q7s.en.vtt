00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.320
 A rear-end collision between two semi-trailers on the A6 between Bad 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 Rappenau and sinsheim-steinsfurt suffered damage during the night 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 caused about 130 thousand euros 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.570
 after recent investigations of the Sinsheimer highway police had to 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.609
 a 57-year-old Romanian semitrailer driver in the two-lane construction site area 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.800
 slowing down due to engine damage 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 a second semitrailer to get from them is no longer there 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.040
 are enough with these 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.370
 then opened 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.090
 so that considerable material damage arose but of the second semitrailer 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.740
 Slightly injured is currently in hospital should be the highway 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.100
 is currently in the driving direction Mannheim Fulda instead of in the direction of travel Heilbronn 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.570
 there is only one lane left 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.250
 and how long the salvage measures take is currently not yet possible 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.430
 estimate 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.120
 by the impact, the concrete guide wall in the few meters 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.630
 pressed the oncoming lane 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.990
 and the vehicles arrive a few meters later on their directional lane 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.100
 stand 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.119
 The impact of the impact completely destroys the cab 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.020
 At the moment we can not ensure home fire safety 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 so accept 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 we have to do it until the towing service becomes the two elite 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.680
 NZ has to match with how the extent of damage on in terms of 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.140
 the expired supplies represents and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.770
 as explain now also with the Autobahnmeisterei from how far that you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 Operating materials drained via the Dallenwil sewage system 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.790
 Dr drove the truck on the tools truck is the heart 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.020
 Mostly the gifts uploaded 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 as it happened exactly to the accident, a subsequent truck driver could not 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.670
 say 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 because many expected explained Keith Blatter babbling balcony 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.240
 meanwhile he has told me 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.219
 Buyer was further as well as the southern area 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.900
 Bayer is the sun Season will be that again you can take the truck while the 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.909
 Fingers as they were so that the price was home had to be 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.449
 and the goals thrown without the profit transfer of the railway 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.430
 For accident recording and recovery of trucks was the a 6 in the direction of Mannheim 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.179
 fully closed for several hours 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:32.389
 the fire department Sinsheim was with six vehicles and 16 Wehr men on site 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.049
 and supported the extensive salvage measures
