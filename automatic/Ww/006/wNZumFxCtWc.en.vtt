one side you have a sort of metallic
gray<00:02:22.610> or<00:02:22.849> silver<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.380> other<00:02:24.530> side<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
gray or silver on the other side you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.830 
gray or silver on the other side you
have<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.069> metallic<00:02:25.520> looking<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.090> yellow<00:02:26.420> very

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
have a metallic looking the yellow very

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080 
have a metallic looking the yellow very
very<00:02:27.050> bright<00:02:27.260> indeed<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.700> guess<00:02:28.880> one<00:02:29.060> of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
very bright indeed and I guess one of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.030 
very bright indeed and I guess one of
the<00:02:29.239> dual<00:02:29.450> uses<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.050> could<00:02:30.260> use<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.650> as

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the dual uses you could use this for as

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.270 
the dual uses you could use this for as
a<00:02:31.069> signaling<00:02:31.760> device<00:02:32.800> if<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.010> were<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
a signaling device if you were in a

a signaling device if you were in a

search-and-rescue situation where you're

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.090 
search-and-rescue situation where you're
lost<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.739> go<00:02:37.730> over<00:02:37.910> here<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:39.560> aircrafts

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
potentially use this this signal it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.370 
potentially use this this signal it's

alternatively<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.519> could<00:02:49.700> just<00:02:49.880> use<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.090> for

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
alternatively you could just use it for

it was intended for another suit not you

it was intended for another suit not you
not<00:02:53.630> me<00:02:53.810> was<00:02:53.989> using<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.590> trip<00:02:54.799> as<00:02:55.040> an

not me was using on the trip as an

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.720 
not me was using on the trip as an
extension<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.690> his<00:02:56.720> Demerest<00:02:57.680> sleeping<00:02:58.519> mat

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
extension to his Demerest sleeping mat

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.030 
extension to his Demerest sleeping mat
just<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> give<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> bit<00:03:00.080> more<00:03:00.140> insulation<00:03:00.799> under

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
just to give a bit more insulation under

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.590 
just to give a bit more insulation under
the<00:03:01.100> feet<00:03:01.310> because<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.880> very<00:03:02.150> very<00:03:02.269> cold

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
the feet because it was a very very cold

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.900 
the feet because it was a very very cold
weekend<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.069> suspect<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.580> could<00:03:04.730> probably

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
weekend and I suspect you could probably

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.410 
weekend and I suspect you could probably
fold<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.660> half<00:03:05.840> like<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:08.090> use<00:03:08.299> it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
fold it up and half like this and use it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.140 
fold it up and half like this and use it
as<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.569> pillow<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:10.459> there's<00:03:10.700> always<00:03:10.819> good<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
as a pillow so there's always good to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.520 
as a pillow so there's always good to
find<00:03:11.299> products<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:11.959> got<00:03:12.140> multiple

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
find products that have got multiple

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830 
find products that have got multiple
uses<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.250> there's<00:03:13.970> certainly<00:03:14.299> but<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.660> has

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
uses and there's certainly but it has

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.789 
uses and there's certainly but it has
that<00:03:15.019> potential<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:16.190> come<00:03:16.459> from<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> civil

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
that potential they come from the civil

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.910 
that potential they come from the civil
plastic<00:03:18.799> SiC<00:03:19.069> here

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.300 

practice<00:03:23.960> here<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:27.390> could<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:28.280> slip<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
practice here you could just slip a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.600 
practice here you could just slip a
bacon<00:03:31.940> yeah<00:03:32.940> again<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.810> does<00:03:33.990> anyway<00:03:34.380> 63<00:03:35.130> sucks

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
bacon yeah again it does anyway 63 sucks

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.330 
bacon yeah again it does anyway 63 sucks
you're<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.120> adding<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.570> lot<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.750> weight<00:03:37.340> to

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
fan of the couple of creatures of hiking

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.300 
fan of the couple of creatures of hiking
but<00:04:03.959> haven't<00:04:04.290> spent<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.560> week<00:04:04.800> in<00:04:05.010> carrying

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
but haven't spent that week in carrying

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.010 
but haven't spent that week in carrying
those<00:04:05.430> heavy<00:04:05.489> packs<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.390> certainly<00:04:06.840> had

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
those heavy packs this certainly had

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.229 
those heavy packs this certainly had
come<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.530> handy<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.520> guess<00:04:08.730> potentially

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
come in handy and I guess potentially

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.650 
come in handy and I guess potentially
you<00:04:09.360> could<00:04:09.450> also<00:04:09.630> use<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:11.130> mat<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.760> your

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you could also use it as a mat for your

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.580 
you could also use it as a mat for your
plate<00:04:13.320> yeah<00:04:14.810> eating<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:16.049> dinner<00:04:16.200> off<00:04:16.410> or
