 That's what I mean , the mouse. 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.120
 He has to think something in the head. 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.420

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.240
 The way that you are, it does not matter at all. 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.130
 that he may be afraid of 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.860
 his physical integrity because he 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.620

 Like it or not, it was understood. 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.160
 then something like the very poor 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.260
 what youtube does will reflect on 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.110

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.519
 prejudice understood I'm here for 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.860
 criticizing to say nothing but this is 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.530
 It's going to happen at one point or another. 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.030
 happen and the crew both in the channel 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.980
 as others who accompanied the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.560
 October masks know that one day goes 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.989
 fall this has a has a way or the guy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.329
 It will reveal itself, but that's where it ends. 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.910
 even good because it reminds of the smoke necklace 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.859
 without who already saw his son the guy 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.359
 kind never showed a goal early decided 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.680
 show but was free and spontaneous 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.930
 will 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.030
 now that fame still loves and two of 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.140
 visit before the icon is that face 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.569
 Little hops, right? 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.030
 now it's ok, it's not the case that is 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.090
 No problem, but it's more for you to understand. 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.239
 what is happening things happen is 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.459

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.590
 right here you saw the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.230
 invest and not spread the face 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.660
