counter<00:01:33.899> disappears<00:01:35.030> little<00:01:36.030> drama<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
counter disappears little drama this is

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.180 
counter disappears little drama this is
actually<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.390> feels<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.950> better

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
actually like feels like it's a better

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.820 
actually like feels like it's a better
thing<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.030> top<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.080> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> can't

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
thing to have on top you can see I can't

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:12.010 
thing to have on top you can see I can't
it's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> hard<00:01:50.610> time<00:01:50.880> using<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.420> display<00:01:51.750> here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:57.660 

same<00:02:13.020> thing<00:02:13.320> over<00:02:13.470> here

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:09.900 

just<00:02:58.670> take<00:02:59.240> it<00:02:59.270> up<00:02:59.480> here<00:03:07.480> same<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.870> one

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
just take it up here same with this one

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.210 
just take it up here same with this one
so<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.620> guess<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.800> now<00:03:12.950> use<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:16.010> do

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
so I guess we now use have to just do

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.449 
so I guess we now use have to just do
gifting<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.730> course<00:03:16.940> with<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.300> galaxy<00:03:18.200> device

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
gifting of course with the galaxy device

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.740 
gifting of course with the galaxy device
if<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.820> hardware<00:03:20.120> button<00:03:20.450> here<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
if you have a hardware button here it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.430 
if you have a hardware button here it
always<00:03:20.930> works<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:26.480> one<00:03:26.750> will<00:03:26.930> probably<00:03:27.080> have

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
always works this one will probably have

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.710
