here's<00:00:05.390> a<00:00:05.479> great<00:00:05.689> example<00:00:06.170> of<00:00:06.679> what<00:00:06.979> happens

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
here's a great example of what happens

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.810 
here's a great example of what happens
with<00:00:07.639> snow<00:00:08.000> comes<00:00:08.420> into<00:00:09.400> contact<00:00:10.400> with

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
with snow comes into contact with

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.640 
with snow comes into contact with
gutters<00:00:11.269> you<00:00:11.450> can<00:00:11.570> see<00:00:11.750> that<00:00:11.930> the<00:00:12.050> snow<00:00:12.320> from

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
gutters you can see that the snow from

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.580 
gutters you can see that the snow from
up<00:00:12.830> above<00:00:13.660> slower<00:00:14.660> a<00:00:14.809> rough<00:00:15.080> section

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
up above slower a rough section

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.640 
up above slower a rough section
basically<00:00:15.800> built<00:00:16.670> up<00:00:16.929> and<00:00:17.929> tore<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.320> gutters

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
basically built up and tore the gutters

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.720 
basically built up and tore the gutters
off<00:00:18.859> including<00:00:19.400> these<00:00:19.489> heavy-duty<00:00:19.849> clamps

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
off including these heavy-duty clamps

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.769 
off including these heavy-duty clamps
what<00:00:22.730> we're<00:00:22.849> going<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.029> do<00:00:23.239> is<00:00:23.449> we're<00:00:23.599> going<00:00:23.630> to

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.439 
what we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:00:23.989> on<00:00:24.109> a<00:00:24.789> clamp<00:00:25.789> on<00:00:25.999> snow<00:00:26.869> protect<00:00:28.449> fence

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
put on a clamp on snow protect fence

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.319 
put on a clamp on snow protect fence
system<00:00:29.779> it'll<00:00:30.319> hold<00:00:30.589> that<00:00:30.829> snow<00:00:31.099> up<00:00:31.310> allow<00:00:32.270> to

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
system it'll hold that snow up allow to

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.950 
system it'll hold that snow up allow to
melt<00:00:33.079> naturally<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.890> go<00:00:34.040> down<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.960> gutters

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
melt naturally and go down the gutters

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.170 
melt naturally and go down the gutters
the<00:00:36.530> way<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:37.280> designed<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.090> do<00:00:38.240> lay<00:00:39.200> the

yet<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:53.180> look<00:00:53.390> down<00:00:53.540> at<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.780> end<00:00:54.020> we<00:00:54.440> have<00:00:54.560> to

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
yet you look down at the end we have to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.770 
yet you look down at the end we have to
make<00:00:54.829> an<00:00:54.980> adjustment<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:55.730> what<00:00:55.850> we<00:00:55.940> can<00:00:56.150> do<00:00:56.329> we

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
make an adjustment and what we can do we

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
make an adjustment and what we can do we
can<00:00:56.930> slide<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.200> coupler<00:00:57.560> over<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:59.090> pull<00:00:59.800> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
can slide the coupler over and pull this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.030 
can slide the coupler over and pull this
back<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.430> forth<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.360> system<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:03.829> make

back and forth in the system to make

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.609 
back and forth in the system to make
everything<00:01:04.400> line<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:05.140> once<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:06.290> get<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:06.530> to

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
everything line up once we get it to

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.359 
everything line up once we get it to
line<00:01:06.829> up<00:01:07.869> then<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.049> go<00:01:09.200> ahead<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.799> put<00:01:10.219> these

screws go in on the side that will

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.169 
screws go in on the side that will
collapse<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:30.200> flat<00:01:30.499> side<00:01:30.889> over<00:01:31.729> here

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.989 

you<00:01:35.179> can<00:01:35.359> see<00:01:35.600> how<00:01:35.929> it's<00:01:36.139> attached<00:01:36.789> is<00:01:37.789> up

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
you can see how it's attached is up

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.440 
you can see how it's attached is up
against<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.389> flat<00:01:38.630> side<00:01:38.959> and<00:01:40.270> remember<00:01:41.270> that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
against the flat side and remember that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.969 
against the flat side and remember that
when<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.719> do<00:01:41.899> put<00:01:42.139> these<00:01:42.289> in<00:01:42.499> there<00:01:42.740> you've

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
when you do put these in there you've

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.399 
when you do put these in there you've
got<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.310> torque<00:01:43.579> these<00:01:43.789> at<00:01:43.999> at<00:01:44.119> least<00:01:44.259> 200<00:01:45.259> inch

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409
