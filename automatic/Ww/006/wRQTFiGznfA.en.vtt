hello<00:00:00.420> there<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.560> be

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hello there this video is going to be

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.860 
hello there this video is going to be
about<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.070> make<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.550> reverse<00:00:03.360> lookup<00:00:03.810> zone

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
about how to make a reverse lookup zone

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.089 
about how to make a reverse lookup zone
in<00:00:04.319> DNS<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:06.270> making<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:06.870> Server<00:00:07.170> 2008<00:00:07.830> but

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
in DNS I'm making it on Server 2008 but

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.280 
in DNS I'm making it on Server 2008 but
you<00:00:08.220> can<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.730> Server<00:00:09.000> 2003<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:10.080> well

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
you can do this on Server 2003 as well

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.440 
you can do this on Server 2003 as well
so<00:00:11.219> click<00:00:11.460> start<00:00:11.910> admin<00:00:12.660> tools<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.290> DNS<00:00:14.450> you

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
so click start admin tools and DNS you

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
so click start admin tools and DNS you
can<00:00:15.599> see<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.500> forward<00:00:17.160> look<00:00:17.310> up

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
can see that I have a forward look up

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
can see that I have a forward look up
zone<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.660> there's<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
zone I actually have to there's a the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.290 
zone I actually have to there's a the
first<00:00:20.070> domain<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> an<00:00:24.000> Active

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
first domain and a this is an Active

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.330 
first domain and a this is an Active
Directory<00:00:24.420> integrated<00:00:25.140> zone<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.039> that's<00:00:26.220> why

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
Directory integrated zone so that's why

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
Directory integrated zone so that's why
there's<00:00:26.519> two<00:00:26.730> zones<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.480> top<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
there's two zones this top one is the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.040 
there's two zones this top one is the
Active<00:00:28.859> Directory<00:00:28.949> integrated<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.050> have

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
Active Directory integrated one I have

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
Active Directory integrated one I have
no<00:00:31.230> reverse<00:00:31.529> lookup<00:00:31.920> zone<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> want<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
no reverse lookup zone so I want to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.720 
no reverse lookup zone so I want to
right-click<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.780> create<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> new<00:00:34.440> zone<00:00:34.730> now

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
right-click and create a new zone now

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
right-click and create a new zone now
the<00:00:35.790> purpose<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.360> reverse<00:00:36.899> look<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.260> zones<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the purpose of reverse look up zones is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.020 
the purpose of reverse look up zones is
that<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.989> translates<00:00:40.590> IP<00:00:41.100> addresses<00:00:41.730> into

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that it translates IP addresses into

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.950 
that it translates IP addresses into
names<00:00:42.920> unlike<00:00:43.920> regular<00:00:44.430> DNS<00:00:45.059> which<00:00:45.390> translate

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
names unlike regular DNS which translate

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
names unlike regular DNS which translate
names<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.860> IP<00:00:47.039> addresses<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.600> useful

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
names into IP addresses this is useful

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
names into IP addresses this is useful
in<00:00:49.079> large<00:00:49.440> organizations<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:51.360> prevent

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in large organizations to prevent

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.010 
in large organizations to prevent
phishing<00:00:53.120> that's<00:00:54.120> fishing

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
phishing that's fishing

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:04.759 
phishing that's fishing
so<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:55.969> pH<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.329> si<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> G<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:01.129> prevent<00:01:03.769> web

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so that's pH I si and G to prevent web

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
so that's pH I si and G to prevent web
sites<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.220> being<00:01:05.460> hijacked<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> sent<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
sites from being hijacked and sent to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.500 
sites from being hijacked and sent to
rogue<00:01:07.080> servers<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:09.619> then<00:01:10.970> people<00:01:11.970> stealing

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
rogue servers and then people stealing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
rogue servers and then people stealing
credentials<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.409> logins<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.369> those<00:01:14.549> rogue

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
credentials or logins from those rogue

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
credentials or logins from those rogue
servers<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.770> holds<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> record<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:18.439> what<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
servers so it holds a record of what the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.620 
servers so it holds a record of what the
IP<00:01:19.710> address<00:01:20.100> should<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> computer

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
IP address should be for that computer

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
IP address should be for that computer

you<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.900> my<00:02:28.140> IP<00:02:28.350> address<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:30.920> 1000<00:02:31.920> dot

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
you can see my IP address is 1000 dot

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:41.120 
you can see my IP address is 1000 dot
one<00:02:37.340> right<00:02:38.340> there<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.110> my<00:02:40.110> subnet<00:02:40.620> mask<00:02:40.920> is

want to know the network ID although

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.490 
want to know the network ID although
truthfully<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:51.120> doesn't<00:02:51.540> need<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.290> network

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
truthfully it doesn't need the network

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.330 
truthfully it doesn't need the network
ID<00:02:53.960> what<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.050> needs<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.470> network<00:02:55.830> portion

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
ID what it needs is the network portion

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.290 
ID what it needs is the network portion
of<00:02:56.630> my<00:02:57.630> IP<00:02:57.870> addresses<00:02:58.500> so<00:03:00.770> since<00:03:01.770> 2<00:03:02.400> VD<00:03:02.670> five<00:03:02.850> is

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300

have to put in is ten ten next now I can

possibly<00:03:31.410> could<00:03:32.160> update<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.730> or<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:34.110> not

allow<00:03:34.500> dynamic<00:03:34.740> updates<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.120> means<00:03:36.480> I

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
allow dynamic updates so that means I

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.510 
allow dynamic updates so that means I
have<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> create<00:03:36.990> all<00:03:37.230> records<00:03:37.740> manually

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520

which is not a bad idea either but it's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.400

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
going to be a lot of work so I'm going

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.160 
going to be a lot of work so I'm going

if I right-click and let's go up here to
refresh

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
refresh

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.650

there's<00:04:34.199> my<00:04:34.349> record<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.910> can<00:04:35.910> should<00:04:36.479> be<00:04:36.599> able

there's my record I can should be able

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.580 
there's my record I can should be able
to<00:04:36.780> right<00:04:37.020> click<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:41.449> now<00:04:42.449> so<00:04:43.440> there's<00:04:43.560> just

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
to right click and now so there's just

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.589 
to right click and now so there's just
the<00:04:43.800> refresh<00:04:44.190> button<00:04:44.220> up<00:04:44.610> there<00:04:44.759> but<00:04:45.300> anyway

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
the refresh button up there but anyway

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.740 
the refresh button up there but anyway
created<00:04:46.050> my<00:04:46.199> record<00:04:46.650> as<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.190> can<00:04:47.340> see<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.789> it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
created my record as you can see and it

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.279 
created my record as you can see and it
translates<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.470> IP<00:04:49.889> address<00:04:51.259> to<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.530> name<00:04:54.289> so

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
translates the IP address to the name so

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.719 
translates the IP address to the name so
hopefully<00:04:55.889> you've<00:04:56.039> learned<00:04:56.069> something<00:04:56.699> from

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
hopefully you've learned something from

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.120 
hopefully you've learned something from
this<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.750> is<00:04:57.960> not<00:04:58.139> a<00:04:58.199> big<00:04:58.500> thing<00:04:58.530> this<00:04:58.979> is

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
this this is not a big thing this is

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.460 
this this is not a big thing this is
largely<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.990> something<00:05:00.990> that's<00:05:01.139> used<00:05:01.319> in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
largely a something that's used in

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.439
