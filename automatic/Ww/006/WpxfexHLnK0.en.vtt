00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.829
 be a wonderful good day my 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.789
 Yes, I'm fully in the spotlight again 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.429
 Today I have a comparison of the lot 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.419
 stuck on the last lap 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.890
 and continue to use the rehab 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.329
 with a magazine 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.789
 as legendary insurer dyed shocked their new dreams 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.640
 It's good if FIFA is a match on a fur 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.390
 and now where in the end will not be ranked second 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.580
 No, it's just meant to entertain you 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.490
 I'll get that if I'm honest 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.389
 because of the playful superiority played and 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:50.389
 yes, I simply could not come in anymore 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 One year the Floriade cut worked or pull in my eyes 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.880
 pretty Effertz efficient upwards at the SGA room 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.330
 as the magazines year normally 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.720
 actually too small are but 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.760
 I have to do it with them and that worked quite well 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 so and now the command for the deep shells keel 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.200
 then on the way to the small corner 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.070
 and what can I say about the new one? 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 the ie9 is year 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 known works 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.780
 has a strong weapon, however, if you have it on me and I had to fire 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.910
 and if you then use full team 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.810
 you have a good chance to do in Kiel 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.720
 yes my second is listening 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.430
 Full of strength and because third, Ninja is actually quite normal for 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 Executives Ali g 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.440
 But it is also possible in the allrounder 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 Tine be used for him «quite normal» Sprengkommando game or im 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 territory 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 my equipment is discovered and the investigators 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.500
 Rakic ​​Peaks are often on the 5 the craters on the clean tech while on 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.860
 9 flew the FDP 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.560
 yes, unfortunately, unfortunately only the Predator because I just do not 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.510
 managed to hear more of Fire 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.250
 we are not even there 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.130
 It was really hard for me to get it back 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 and with that we also come to today's danger was 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.230
 Of course it's easy 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.540
 What do you sing? No song needs to be costly 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.999
 for a very simple things 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.479
 that their company asked for business does not count anymore 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.789
 what are you doing to fail again to come in their old rhythm 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:25.909
 and that as fast as possible 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.099
 that reports the man breaks knowledge 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.379
 what does everyone do 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.430
 Because I have no special technique and maybe that Qiagen one 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.480
 or another tip for me because then I could also implement in the game 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 although we play some logs round 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.519
 then what can I do well per game after a rehab even without a muffler 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.599
 say if you so undercuts with free trap then you are allowed on 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.849
 no case reversing the find play 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.000
 you must always when you have shot "As soon as possible again 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.540
 Place to go at the FCA is not really on the Melt 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.479
 Consequently, 1 can also give a tip to your past situations 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.509
 and because you are being attacked from behind 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.300
 then flies through the lightning fast factories bit 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.619
 through the discovery 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.169
 get up and push your opponents off 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.499
 So the tactic really works very often and I knew Ulbricht 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.499
 on next 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.569
 the now dusted in internet traffic 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.709
 and with dexterity, reloading at the FDA is finally over 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.289
 a really great thing 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.389
 Quite simply because the Sauerland then it just takes a little longer than 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.199
 in the mp4 or other 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.289
 Assault rifles and that's why 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.549
 rarely very much by the combination with dexterity 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.439
 very efficient 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.409
 actually it will become why 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.009
 especially the magazine extension 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.269
 JAL animals new general 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.269
 You can keep what you want from her 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.319
 Reich finds himself with his favorite weapon but this time too much 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.699
 watch TV 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.119
 so and now I want to address again lately is the diner 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:00.489
 the direction has gone 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.769
 yes the weapon is Obertauern the other variant is on tour, according to Vogt 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.749
 Althea 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.409
 Robert Mayer 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.839
 Jael 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.309
 I personally 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.359
 again does not say so 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.590
 because really almost every weapon is if place and really dared to tune Tober 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.969
 Weapons are used 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.969
 then there is also where the game is because of the balance or 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.509
 I do not know how we like the Raiders 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.979
 I mean, if every Euro has Porte weapon 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.050
 then the game is back in balance 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.920
 Well, that's why 50 percent do not always like being quick with these 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.999
 Proporz and so on as I had there once 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.479
 I am now simply over Feldmark with the much fun to do 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.479
 of course save the rate of children, of course 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.610
 Oderberg like command think Ploski I think I stay a little bit away 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.749
 from 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.809
 for the easy 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.740
 Fluor Burghauser but I do not want it now 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.569
 continue to start 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.900
 we're just going back to the mountain 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.279
 he marries Kate Winslet's throat 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.849
 hold me now but an equal bright and what happens the guy knows that 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.219
 I was there and stopped me 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.699
 therefore followed typed 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.949
 shoots once so he tries as fast as possible and above all so 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.189
 as far as possible come from the comeback few create 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.050
 what the act at Audi be very careful 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.330
 more room 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.229
 then just go Jom 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.370
 and then wait for the first victim 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.270
 Clack clack clack but bath 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.270
 how much of the opponents Town 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:33.249
 this guy 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.309
 I do not know 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.860
 I've died dead on overseas 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.160
 I thought we were where we wanted to be 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.070
 which I also felt I wanted to test 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.979
 but I'm totally happy 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.039
 minister 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.360
 Place of performance more 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.409
 now comes the same level of early training I think I hold myself 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.449
 buy in the small house 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.050
 around me again 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.619
 against Aue must live again Aachen 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.619
 and now I'll take this m4 with the grenade launcher 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.119
 I fortunately did not use it 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.159
 and now Japan to realize in the area 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.159
 over those little buttons of their over 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.379
 Frey leaves 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.419
 what I want to say about this LinkLink I have really cool IT 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.520
 played out 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.939
 Do not ask me why 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.990
 but I probably played from 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.080
 Of course that was also a big disadvantage that had me in the case 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:29.289
 but I think that it is without a fence to build that really only one 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.849
 Game was the one I've ever played Fiedler from the end but all right 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.569
 more companies gossiping developers has thought I would have donated yet 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.979
 Indeed 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.619
 but the father was forbidden 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:45.249
 a ca bath 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.499
 and the second complex honor point 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:49.819
 and the party pieces won 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:51.909
 yes people who said three titles 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.309
 not outstanding 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:56.820
 but in that sense I hope my answer here greed question 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.039
 what are you doing to come back in? 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.839
 Teams like rated 11 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.749
 not only Tel 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:04.839
 take care 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:08.149
 and until first 0 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:09.099
 Where
