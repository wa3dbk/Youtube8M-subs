00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
because I've tried one time or two times

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.950

took<00:03:15.110> around<00:03:15.470> 20<00:03:15.980> minutes<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.650> got<00:03:19.010> that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
took around 20 minutes but I got that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.970 
took around 20 minutes but I got that
portal<00:03:19.700> crossbow<00:03:20.210> now<00:03:20.720> what<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:21.410> thinking<00:03:21.830> of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
portal crossbow now what I'm thinking of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.130 
portal crossbow now what I'm thinking of
I<00:03:22.190> know<00:03:22.280> might<00:03:22.670> sound<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.000> new<00:03:23.210> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
I know might sound like a new that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.540 
I know might sound like a new that
you're<00:03:24.260> supposed<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.560> put<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.830> Royal<00:03:25.040> pieces

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
you're supposed to put the Royal pieces

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.370 
you're supposed to put the Royal pieces
if<00:03:25.730> I'm<00:03:26.030> right<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.840> make<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> royal

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
if I'm right and then I make a royal

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.630 
if I'm right and then I make a royal
crossbow<00:03:28.300> but<00:03:29.300> that's<00:03:29.630> another<00:03:29.900> time<00:03:30.640> super

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
crossbow but that's another time super

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.140 
crossbow but that's another time super
anti<00:03:32.030> fires<00:03:32.440> would<00:03:33.440> probably<00:03:33.770> be<00:03:33.890> more<00:03:34.150> worth

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
anti fires would probably be more worth

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.330 
anti fires would probably be more worth
it<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:35.630> actually<00:03:36.200> use<00:03:36.350> getting<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.830> Royal

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
it than actually use getting a Royal

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.240

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
if this is analysis X move unsuccessful

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.619 
if this is analysis X move unsuccessful
attempt<00:06:06.169> there's<00:06:07.169> one<00:06:07.259> clear<00:06:07.800> conclusion<00:06:08.629> get

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
attempt there's one clear conclusion get

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.079 
attempt there's one clear conclusion get
super<00:06:10.169> anti<00:06:10.589> fires<00:06:10.919> before<00:06:11.550> you<00:06:11.909> actually

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089

super anti fires before you actually
attempt<00:06:12.689> to<00:06:13.189> you<00:06:14.189> qbd<00:06:15.199> so<00:06:16.199> if<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:16.919> don't<00:06:17.129> somehow

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
attempt to you qbd so if I don't somehow

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.359 
attempt to you qbd so if I don't somehow
managed<00:06:18.119> to<00:06:18.149> kill<00:06:18.449> this<00:06:19.039> that's<00:06:20.039> probably

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:20.369

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.930 
conclusion is i need to get super anti
fires<00:06:52.120> i'm<00:06:52.449> probably<00:06:52.750> gonna<00:06:52.900> get<00:06:53.050> 80<00:06:53.430> so<00:06:54.430> and

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
fires i'm probably gonna get 80 so and

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.689 
fires i'm probably gonna get 80 so and
then<00:06:55.539> i'm<00:06:55.660> gonna<00:06:55.780> use<00:06:56.080> the<00:06:56.320> stew<00:06:56.590> to<00:06:57.130> boost<00:06:57.430> up

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
then i'm gonna use the stew to boost up

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.050 
then i'm gonna use the stew to boost up
or<00:06:58.479> 81<00:06:59.190> so<00:07:00.190> that's<00:07:00.370> going<00:07:00.520> to<00:07:00.580> cost<00:07:00.729> me<00:07:00.820> another

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
or 81 so that's going to cost me another

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.469 
or 81 so that's going to cost me another
10<00:07:01.570> mil<00:07:01.780> maybe<00:07:02.310> but<00:07:03.310> i<00:07:03.550> probably<00:07:03.970> will<00:07:04.330> be

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
10 mil maybe but i probably will be

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.840 
10 mil maybe but i probably will be
getting<00:07:04.780> the<00:07:04.900> 50<00:07:05.259> ml<00:07:05.440> first<00:07:05.770> and<00:07:06.100> then<00:07:06.550> i'll<00:07:06.699> do

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
getting the 50 ml first and then i'll do
