00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.850
 santos the tens of meters deep fall he was everywhere the sign of the 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.400
 ryck something from leader denis mentsjov had a remarkably good drive of his 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.199
 foreign in Amsterdam 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.409
 how do they deal with the fall and the continuation of the giro d'italia 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230
 there is a wooden one 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.169
 to sell in the homes 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.019
 Wherever possible, go some day to wake up the 2 percent director 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.409
 to become 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.280
 the circumstances very well by the municipality and so 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.730
 but also a lot better 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.790
 what does such a thing from the middle east then you go promotion how see you go 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430
 different today 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.680
 year after year 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.360
 but today is 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.730
 these criteria to which they are a fine but tomorrow is the day after 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.030
 the day of rest is 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 working shows 60 kilometers a day 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.240
 yes in the subtle way or that way to the descents yes I look there is a button 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.910
 people were shooting 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.720
 have to drive down on the ces wall street 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.180
 after the club 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 the mugger 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.750
 you should not think of course that I state during the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.470
 monitor winter break with the police 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.620
 I also never come though 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.090
 is nice that we are in a hotel country 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.980
 another reason for the decision 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.710
 the hague the dutch norms and values 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.590
 to attend and build and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 r are currently 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 of course you are going to give a very different feeling where you are unchanged 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.380
 convert button 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.619
 nevertheless wants to get that first team, yet the world wants that match 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.800
 of course I want to be militant 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 the most important thing is also the church, the team also has the third set 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.430
 i think salons of good chance have the video here 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.600
 I will fully agree 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.980
 the competition feed 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.570
 I think that everyone has seen it approved 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.100
 I also know well there is the company of a group from last week 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.500
 Alkmaar Dirk van Bastelaere is everything 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 according to the petercam the OV chip card 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.760
