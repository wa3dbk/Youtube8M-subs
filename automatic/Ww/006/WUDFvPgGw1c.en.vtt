00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
hello YouTube daven ada here and i'm

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490 
hello YouTube daven ada here and i'm
here<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.370> new<00:00:14.639> series<00:00:14.969> called<00:00:15.500> mini

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
here with a new series called mini

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.010 
here with a new series called mini
builds<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.820> basically<00:00:18.240> what<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> mini<00:00:18.600> build<00:00:18.840> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
builds so basically what a mini build is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
builds so basically what a mini build is
is<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.619> looked<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.189> over<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.670> place<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> think

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
is I looked all over the place and think

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
is I looked all over the place and think
in<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.539> brain<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.710> cool<00:00:22.890> designs

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
in my brain and I think of cool designs

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.130 
in my brain and I think of cool designs
that<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.760> should<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.510> Minecraft

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that would be should be in Minecraft

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.759 
that would be should be in Minecraft
like<00:00:26.420> for<00:00:27.420> example<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.869> episode<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> slot

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
like for example this episode is a slot

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.490 
like for example this episode is a slot
machine<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.609> compact<00:00:30.179> slot<00:00:30.480> machine<00:00:30.840> now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
machine a very compact slot machine now

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.930 
machine a very compact slot machine now
i'm<00:00:31.560> pretty<00:00:31.769> sure<00:00:31.949> everyone<00:00:32.130> knows<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
i'm pretty sure everyone knows of the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
i'm pretty sure everyone knows of the
huge<00:00:33.270> slot<00:00:33.600> machines<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.170> about<00:00:34.440> 100

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
huge slot machines that are about 100

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.450 
huge slot machines that are about 100
blocks<00:00:35.309> long<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.320> super<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.559> crazy<00:00:38.010> like

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
blocks long and super like crazy like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
blocks long and super like crazy like
how<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.770> stuff

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
how they do like what they do and stuff

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.630 
how they do like what they do and stuff
it's<00:00:41.730> crazy<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.809> i<00:00:43.110> decided<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:44.239> made<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.710> 5<00:00:46.710> x<00:00:47.070> 6<00:00:47.430> x

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's crazy so i decided i made a 5 x 6 x

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
it's crazy so i decided i made a 5 x 6 x
5<00:00:48.649> basically<00:00:49.649> 5<00:00:50.489> x<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.750> five<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> then

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
5 basically 5 x and then five and then

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.069 
5 basically 5 x and then five and then
it's<00:00:53.430> called<00:00:53.670> i<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.629> said<00:00:54.780> six

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it's called i just have just said six

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's called i just have just said six
because<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.610> people

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
because this I don't know people

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.229 
because this I don't know people
consider<00:00:57.930> these<00:00:58.079> blocks<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.770> guess<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.579> do

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
consider these blocks but I guess I do

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
consider these blocks but I guess I do
so<00:01:01.579> how<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.820> works<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> does<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:05.280> i

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so how this works or what it does more i

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.810 
so how this works or what it does more i
should<00:01:05.670> say<00:01:06.619> every<00:01:07.619> 30<00:01:07.890> levels<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> play<00:01:08.580> as

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
should say every 30 levels of play as

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
should say every 30 levels of play as
you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.930> says<00:01:10.200> um<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:13.080> hear<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you can see it says um you can hear a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
you can see it says um you can hear a
piston<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.710> walk<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> click<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.689> button

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
piston go walk and you click this button

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
piston go walk and you click this button
and<00:01:18.320> what<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.470> didn't<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:19.860> anything<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.369> one

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and what I didn't get anything that one

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
and what I didn't get anything that one
so<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:21.659> unlucky<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:22.830> say

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
so that was pretty unlucky but let's say

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
so that was pretty unlucky but let's say
it's<00:01:23.189> any<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.520> levels<00:01:24.380> click<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.799> got

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's any more levels click it and I got

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's any more levels click it and I got
an<00:01:26.040> iron<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.409> uh<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:30.000> can't<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.630> again

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
an iron so now uh I can't do that again

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.179 
an iron so now uh I can't do that again
because<00:01:31.409> i'll<00:01:31.560> show<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.159> now

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
because i'll show you this right now

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
because i'll show you this right now
it's<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.049> reason<00:01:34.259> why<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.740> think

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's actually the reason why i think

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's actually the reason why i think
this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:35.700> slot<00:01:35.939> machine<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.979> because

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this is a good slot machine is because

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
this is a good slot machine is because
let's<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.500> server

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
let's say you make this on your server

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.730 
let's say you make this on your server
and<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.970> use<00:01:42.210> XP<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.899> money<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.380> i<00:01:43.500> did

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and your you use XP as money like i did

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
and your you use XP as money like i did
on<00:01:43.860> mine<00:01:44.070> although<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.420> only<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
on mine although you can only have a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.880 
on mine although you can only have a
maximum<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.470> viewing<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:48.799> 16,000<00:01:49.799> i

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
maximum of viewing of like 16,000 i

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.880 
maximum of viewing of like 16,000 i
believe<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.360> mean<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> only<00:01:52.680> part

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
believe so I mean that's the only part

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
believe so I mean that's the only part
that<00:01:52.950> isn't<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.880> best<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.329> mean<00:01:54.540> hey

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that isn't the best but I mean hey

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.780 
that isn't the best but I mean hey
that's<00:01:55.380> still<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:55.890> big<00:01:56.159> number<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.490> it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that's still pretty big number and it's

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.600 
that's still pretty big number and it's
pretty<00:01:57.060> hard<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.579> i

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pretty hard to do so as you can see i

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.660 
pretty hard to do so as you can see i
just<00:01:59.850> picked<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.270> arrows<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> okay<00:02:01.670> so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
just picked up some arrows and okay so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.490 
just picked up some arrows and okay so
i'm<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.060> gonna<00:02:03.240> show<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.630> step<00:02:04.140> by<00:02:04.259> step

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
i'm not gonna show up step by step

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
i'm not gonna show up step by step
because<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.189> tried<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> over<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> just

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
because i tried that over there and just

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.290 
because i tried that over there and just
I<00:02:07.170> ended<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.710> explaining<00:02:08.099> things<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.700> double

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
I ended up explaining things like double

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.390 
I ended up explaining things like double
so<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so this is probably going to be like the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.750 
so this is probably going to be like the
only<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.819> explain<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
only time I explain it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.289 
only time I explain it
hopefully<00:02:13.689> so<00:02:14.680> basically<00:02:15.220> what<00:02:15.670> happens<00:02:16.090> is

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
hopefully so basically what happens is

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.559 
hopefully so basically what happens is
down<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> clock<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:19.180> hopper

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
down here there is a clock with a hopper

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.449 
down here there is a clock with a hopper
going<00:02:19.900> back<00:02:20.079> and<00:02:20.260> forth<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.799> each<00:02:21.069> other's

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
going back and forth into each other's

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.270 
going back and forth into each other's
hopper<00:02:21.879> which<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:22.870> setting<00:02:23.379> off<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.829> command

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
hopper which is setting off this command

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.640 
hopper which is setting off this command
block<00:02:24.459> which<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.239> testing<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.200> nearest

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
block which is testing for the nearest

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.440 
block which is testing for the nearest
player<00:02:27.159> too<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.599> has<00:02:29.069> level<00:02:30.069> minimum<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.849> 30

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
player too if it has level minimum of 30

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.890 
player too if it has level minimum of 30
levels<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:33.220> when<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.269> activated

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
levels and then when this is activated

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.110 
levels and then when this is activated
so<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.290> i<00:02:35.409> go<00:02:35.440> into<00:02:36.209> game<00:02:37.209> 0<00:02:37.390> 0<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.730> 3<00:02:39.730> levels

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so if i go into game 0 0 and 3 levels

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.030 
so if i go into game 0 0 and 3 levels
you<00:02:40.599> can<00:02:40.629> see<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.319> turn<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.650> that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you can see that just turn on that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.280 
you can see that just turn on that
piston<00:02:42.519> turned<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.909> which<00:02:43.689> that<00:02:43.900> means<00:02:44.079> when<00:02:44.230> i

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
piston turned up which that means when i

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.110 
piston turned up which that means when i
click<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> button<00:02:44.859> you'll<00:02:45.280> see<00:02:45.940> this

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
click this button you'll see this

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
click this button you'll see this
repeater<00:02:46.510> will<00:02:46.989> turn<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.810> shoot<00:02:49.810> an<00:02:49.959> arrow

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
repeater will turn on and shoot an arrow

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.539 
repeater will turn on and shoot an arrow
so<00:02:51.400> i<00:02:51.639> just<00:02:51.670> got<00:02:52.030> gold<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.780> um<00:02:53.549> so

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
so i just got gold that one um so

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.809 
so i just got gold that one um so
another<00:02:55.359> thing<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.920> well<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.159> one<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.549> one

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
another thing is well for one this one

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.349 
another thing is well for one this one
is<00:02:58.030> XP<00:02:58.930> minus<00:02:59.250> 30<00:03:00.250> levels<00:03:00.639> nearest<00:03:01.150> player

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
is XP minus 30 levels nearest player

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.470 
is XP minus 30 levels nearest player
that<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.769> does<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.250> minus<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.269> 30

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
that all that does is it minus is the 30

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.710 
that all that does is it minus is the 30
levels<00:03:04.900> from<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.170> nearest<00:03:05.349> player<00:03:05.590> basically

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
levels from the nearest player basically

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.270 
levels from the nearest player basically
this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.780> filled<00:03:08.170> with<00:03:08.230> arrows<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:08.980> this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
this is filled with arrows and that this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.129 
this is filled with arrows and that this
is<00:03:09.340> why<00:03:09.489> it's<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.819> game<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.000> chance<00:03:10.359> because<00:03:10.659> it

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
is why it's a game of chance because it

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.379 
is why it's a game of chance because it
has<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> chance<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> hit<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.670> button<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
has a chance to hit this button and it

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.259 
has a chance to hit this button and it
has<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> chance<00:03:14.170> not<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.819> another<00:03:15.819> thing<00:03:16.120> why

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
has a chance not to another thing why

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.849 
has a chance not to another thing why
this<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.569> really<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:16.959> on<00:03:17.049> servers<00:03:17.590> is

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
this is really good on servers is

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.050 
this is really good on servers is
because<00:03:18.190> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> had<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.730> give<00:03:18.940> yourself

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
because if you had to give yourself

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.140 
because if you had to give yourself
money<00:03:19.629> and<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:21.010> click<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.579> if<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:21.819> give<00:03:22.030> myself

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
money and they click so if I give myself

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.689 
money and they click so if I give myself
like<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.720> thousand<00:03:23.230> levels<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.769> think<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.519> have

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
like a thousand levels I think I have

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.220 
like a thousand levels I think I have
that<00:03:24.730> up<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.680> yep<00:03:26.819> one<00:03:27.819> more<00:03:27.970> okay<00:03:28.389> so<00:03:29.109> now

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
that up here yep one more okay so now

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.400 
that up here yep one more okay so now
you<00:03:29.410> can<00:03:29.620> see<00:03:30.510> okay<00:03:31.510> now<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.930> go<00:03:32.079> into<00:03:32.199> game

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
you can see okay now if I go into game

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.349 
you can see okay now if I go into game
mode<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.919> I<00:03:33.280> use<00:03:33.489> up<00:03:33.639> 30<00:03:33.849> levels<00:03:34.299> don't<00:03:35.169> get<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
mode and I use up 30 levels don't get it

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.629 
mode and I use up 30 levels don't get it
and<00:03:37.359> if<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.989> finally<00:03:38.440> do<00:03:38.620> get<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.340> want<00:03:39.489> to

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
and if I finally do get it and I want to

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.809 
and if I finally do get it and I want to
try<00:03:39.819> again<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.190> keep<00:03:42.340> firing

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
try again it's just going to keep firing

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.379 
try again it's just going to keep firing
arrows<00:03:43.410> which<00:03:44.410> will<00:03:44.590> actually<00:03:45.150> decrease<00:03:46.150> your

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
arrows which will actually decrease your

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.319 
arrows which will actually decrease your
chances<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:47.019> bling<00:03:47.319> because<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.209> to

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
chances of bling because the you have to

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.270 
chances of bling because the you have to
wait<00:03:49.480> until<00:03:49.629> that<00:03:49.959> air<00:03:50.199> ODIs<00:03:50.530> ponds<00:03:50.980> for<00:03:51.160> your

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
wait until that air ODIs ponds for your

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.759 
wait until that air ODIs ponds for your
next<00:03:51.489> play<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.569> your<00:03:52.930> players<00:03:53.230> on<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.560> server

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
next play but your players on the server

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.500 
next play but your players on the server
won't<00:03:54.010> know<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.459> giving<00:03:54.819> you<00:03:55.090> money<00:03:55.269> every

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
won't know that giving you money every

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.339 
won't know that giving you money every
time<00:03:55.629> they<00:03:55.930> click<00:03:56.139> this<00:03:56.290> button<00:03:58.139> another<00:03:59.139> how

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
time they click this button another how

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.960 
time they click this button another how
this<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.650> chance<00:03:59.949> is<00:04:00.220> because<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.760> this

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
this is chance is because on this

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.589 
this is chance is because on this
dispenser<00:04:01.389> there's<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:03.549> whatever<00:04:04.419> you

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
dispenser there's one you whatever you

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.720 
dispenser there's one you whatever you
use<00:04:04.780> for<00:04:04.989> currency<00:04:05.199> but<00:04:06.040> there's<00:04:06.430> one<00:04:06.669> thing

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
use for currency but there's one thing

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.780 
use for currency but there's one thing
of<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.419> really<00:04:07.629> valuable<00:04:08.139> medium<00:04:09.069> value<00:04:09.579> and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
of the really valuable medium value and

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.750 
of the really valuable medium value and
then<00:04:10.000> pretty<00:04:10.750> cheap<00:04:11.409> value<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.129> that's

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
then pretty cheap value and that's

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.360 
then pretty cheap value and that's
basically<00:04:13.060> how<00:04:13.389> this<00:04:13.930> works<00:04:14.199> is<00:04:14.409> because<00:04:14.530> it

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
basically how this works is because it

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.569 
basically how this works is because it
usually<00:04:15.699> picks<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.780> when<00:04:17.530> dispenser<00:04:18.159> drops<00:04:18.400> it

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
usually picks it when dispenser drops it
