 prepare a rich team ice cream makes 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.390
 some months we already prepare the base 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.070
 homemade ice cream if you have not 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.400

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.370
 and well we also made the snow 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.340
 lemon ice cream lemon ice cream 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.530
 cookie this time we're going to do it 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.350
 team 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.450
 for our kiwi side the first thing that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.020
 let's make is our ice cream base 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.330
 and how can you remember us? 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.000
 to make the base of the ice cream we are going to 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:17.090
 need a can of evaporated milk 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.440
 this evaporated milk is a 360 can 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.200
 grams we are going to occupy a milk can 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.430
 condensed and this milk can 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 condensed is 397 grams too 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.630
 we are going to need 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 a can or a box of these on average 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.290
 cream and this box contains 250 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.620
 milliliters 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.990
 if you do not get the half cream 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.240
 can do it by adding half of 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 cream of this cream that we use to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.960
 eat normally the enchiladas or the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.260
 tacos and half evaporated milk and 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.750
 so we would have already our half cream 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:04.510
 we are also going to need 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.850
 and a half cup of milk powder 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.740
 and we will also occupy here not the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.200
 I have but we are going to need a 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.629
 teaspoon vanilla 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.080
 and to make our base the first thing that 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:20.709
 let's do ya know is to put on fire 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.350
 our milk evaporated with milk with 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.110
 condensed milk 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.580
 and once you release it start to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 let the boil 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.270
 we are going to add our average 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.420
 cream and milk powder let's 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.740
 add also the vanilla and let's 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.710
 Leave it on the fire for a few minutes 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.530
 and good if you want to check the 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.670
 video can look for it so it's called base 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.099
 for homemade ice cream 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.620
 We're going to need our Kiwi here 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.840
 I have 2 kiwis are already peeled and the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.930
 chop a little and here I already have my base 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.969
 of icecream 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.709
 so I already emptied the glass of the 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.740
 blender 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.830
 and we are going to liquefy it 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.920
 once we liquefy the kiwis with the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.090
 base for the ice cream let's empty it 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:25.360
 on an aluminum container 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 to start taking it to the freezer 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.720
 we emptied our base here with the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.320
 ice cream so we stayed 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.080
 I 'm going to take this to the freezer 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.430
 for an hour and after the hour I'm going 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.310
 I'm going to take it out and with a blender 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.030
 or with a fork I'm going to beat it again 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.460
 then this is going the fridge 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.650
 one hour has passed 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.440
 and now what I'm going to do is with a 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.410
 fork 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.450
 I will be carving 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.129
 until everything is stirred 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.760
 and we will go back to take 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.760
 freezer 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.880
 you can do it with the blender to me 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.950
 It makes me easier with a fork 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.950
 but that's how you like it 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.740
 wash yourself and honey side I'll return it the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.200
 freezer for another hour 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.260
 Here I have the kiwi ice cream 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.320
 I've been debating it 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.960
 for three times I already did it three times 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.740
 and well this would be the last time 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.460
 I'm going to take it to the freezer 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:51.069
 and I'm going to leave it there for 3 or 4 hours 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.069
 more or less to be able to serve it 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.320
 Here we have our delicious ice cream 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.139
 finished 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.930
 so we stayed 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.370
 I was mixing it since yesterday and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.120
 then I left it all night in the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.490
 freezer 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.490
 and well, it was no longer useful 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.360
 here is our side served me what 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:25.389
 decorate with some cookies 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.389
 and I'm going to put a little chocolate 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.700
 I hope you liked this recipe
