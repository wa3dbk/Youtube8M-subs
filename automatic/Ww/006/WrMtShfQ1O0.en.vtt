00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello good day the next time you travel from 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 do not be surprised if you hear the voice of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.130
 a woman passing information about the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320
 flight 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 they are in charge and not just in the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.940
 commercial aircraft has a woman driving the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 war aircraft has been aboard the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.840
 Lieutenant Eliane and the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.990
 Total aircraft commander joan 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.480
 planned flights of 53 minutes and here it is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 a plane of the largest applicant who still 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.750
 does not command anything but is counting the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.750
 hours to get there 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 of the nearly 600 students at the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.950
 Air Force 28 are women and everyone 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.660
 starts the same way 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.320
 This is an airplane on which the cadets 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.270
 learn to fly is the 25th model of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 entry into military aviation 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.059
 The panel is very simple. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 essential tools for piloting is 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.320
 almost every manual and engine recalled the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.659
 beetle 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 only that instead of four cylinders are 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.240
 six that produce 10 times more force 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.180
 to take more than one tonne out of the ground 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.430
 has six cylinder bump the pilot 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.130
 then I'm starting 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.500
 injects fuel directly into the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 it does not have an engine 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.229
 carburetor 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.420
 it works under direct management was a 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.670
 of those that lieutenant eliane 30 the sky 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.270
 alone for the first time five years 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.600
 ago now pilots amazon c-105 made 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.380
 to transport troops and cargo up to 7 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.319
 tons 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.149
 Her mother knows mother's heart well. 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.640
 It always gets a little tight, right? 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.250
 mother shipped six tons of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.429
 explosive our daughter came home 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.069
 It got all is okay but 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.990
 lieutenant trusts the owner of my 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.679
 security when I say exactly 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.900
 that my preparation in the study and dedication 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.860
 and so I can be sure of the flight 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.360
 sure not 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.360
 You know that I know 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.489
 at the cadet academy the line up 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.220
 a more sophisticated plane first time 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.450
 she left a popular ranges for 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.310
 model 1.6 13 27 a toucan and feel the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.830
 differences here and see if people 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.660
 can climb the thousand papers is almost 125 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 very difficult due to right engine and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.379
 also here we say the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 aviation kerosene uses the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.040
 petrol- filled messages have the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.959
 Most modern hotel facilities where 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 can fly at night quietly them 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.230
 have an ejection seat is not the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.230
 which he has already maintained in 5 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.819
 very good to know that women 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.829
 they are breaking paradigms, that is 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.959
 wonderful 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.840
 the passenger talks about the pilot who 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.440
 turned attraction also on firm ground 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.230
 and like that 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.330
 joana took leave to fly at 17 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.260
 years before they even had a 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.590
 driver 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.569
 today with 26 already counts seven of experience 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 in boeing his automatic is fine 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.030
 different from car, you know, because a lot of grapes 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.950
 has the speed or as a thing that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 do not do everything we program uphill 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.290
 down and slow down and accelerate does everything 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 alone today I only saw this modern one does not have 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.880
 force, so there is no force 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.739
 male does not make a difference does not help 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.959
 It does not even bother you, it 's the same thing. 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.060
 the amazon is a little different 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.829
 to fly an aircraft like this is more 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.989
 forces the most skill 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.060
 I think it's a bit of both in strength. 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.760
 people can use the compensator that 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.500
 this button here then at first easy 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.319
 the strength I need to get the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.989
 airplane promoted and compensates through 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.579
 button to decrease my effort 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.530
 first owner of my command and framed 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:12.200
 front and require knowledge 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.569
 military academy makes with others 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.459
 impositions the earring must not exceed 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.220
 the earlobe must be a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.650
 bright tiny discreet nail 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.470
 may well be on a well-made basis 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.470
 but I can not glaze dark and medium 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.810
 ariane but the woman and knows reconcile 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.850
 things I 'm fulfilling my dream of mine 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.199
 great goal is the time within the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.900
 work environment show me 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.940
 professional I want to be treated 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.000
 professionally did not receive any type 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.729
 because she is a woman and does not use 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.710
 of my femininity to achieve 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.710
 some kind of advantage was the opposite
