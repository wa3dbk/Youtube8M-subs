 take off stunning pictures and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.750
 to fly 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.039
 the spidercam the computer controlled 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 camera innovation everyone is talking about 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.530
 and that all thrills she never delivers 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 old perspectives like one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 flying object moves the spidercam 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.180
 on stage spectators fans and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 in every corner of the stadium 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.479
 three-dimensional in all 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 heaven in the best hd 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.540
 quality just on ball and head height 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 same again high in the sky the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.330
 spectator is in the middle of the green 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.530
 lawn or he dives into the water 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 You can not do sport more dynamically 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
 transfer and live at home 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 spidercam hovering over the ice by 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 final elegant unprecedented camera 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.940
 flapping the television spectators in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 her spell 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.610
 a cable system that scores four points 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.500
 The camera is held in place in two 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.070
 Axis remote always stops at the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.070
 desired position 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.520
 The required amount of points can eg 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.060
 light towers catwalks or tears 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.070
 to be assembled 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.080
 four motors drive the system 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.820
 from a central computer, the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 spiral and constant 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.230
 monitors you receive via fiber optics 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.300
 in real time the information as you 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.850
 to unroll or unroll the ropes 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.530
 have two of the ropes are with fiberglass 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.080
 provided as is lossless celebration 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.270
 Data transfer guarantees the control 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.130
 the spyder can take over the pilot 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.870
 operator also serves the camera 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.930
 including zoom and focus 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.880
 all rides are memory was so 100 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.400
 percent exactly repeat 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.920
 the maximum speed of the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 spidercam is eight meters per second 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.900
 The maximum conceivable size is 250 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 sometimes 250 meters 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.240
 the use is both outdoor and 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.560
 Indoor possible are sensational 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.560
 guaranteed 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.390
 olympic champions league 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.340
 world championships with the spider can 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 Price of the spectators around the world 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.330
 Goose bumps guaranteed even if the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.099
 spectators must stay at home and 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.290
 The camera can not be on the spot 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.790
 meets the highest safety standards 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.860
 made in germany 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.349
 the safety aspect enjoys the highest 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.450
 Priority on the ropes only weighs one 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.319
 low traction of max. 60 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.079
 kilogram 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.129
 although often up to 1200 kilograms 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.959
 are designed 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.650
 that means a twentyfold 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.000
 safety cushion the battery life 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.640
 Eight hours is the dolly that 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.190
 Both came against external influences 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.380
 electronic office stabilized 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.720
 the camera can be any point of 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.840
 playing field and every situation in the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.550
 show a bird's-eye view of a hall 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.190
 Once installed in the hall lies the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.040
 camera to every device to every athlete 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.120
 a camera allows infinite 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.740
 perspectives and applications 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.900
 fascinating flight movements and that at 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.880
 the most diverse theirs 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
 Deployment possibilities of the spyder core 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.500
 are manifold the transfer becomes 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.260
 greatly upgraded by the spidercam 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.130
 the possibilities are no limits 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.190
 set 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.060
 spidercam simply the world's best 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.060
 perspective
