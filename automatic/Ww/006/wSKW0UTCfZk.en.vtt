00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
it was our schedule got compressed and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.890

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
run on DSP and super bike I barely had

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.810 
run on DSP and super bike I barely had
any<00:01:03.170> any<00:01:03.380> rest<00:01:03.620> between<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:03.950> races<00:01:04.400> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
any any rest between the races and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.760 
any any rest between the races and
feeling<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.810> fatigue<00:01:05.930> from<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.470> today<00:01:06.710> so

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
feeling the fatigue from that today so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.040 
feeling the fatigue from that today so
hopefully<00:01:07.550> we<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:07.940> get<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.240> quick<00:01:08.570> nap<00:01:08.780> here

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
hopefully we can get a quick nap here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.390 
hopefully we can get a quick nap here
and<00:01:09.260> be<00:01:09.710> ready<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.950> go<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.130> later<00:01:10.280> this

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
and be ready to go to later this

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.550 
and be ready to go to later this
afternoon<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.810> dock<00:01:12.050> though<00:01:12.290> with<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
afternoon the dock though with the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.830 
afternoon the dock though with the
v-twin<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.460> these<00:01:13.850> little<00:01:14.000> point<00:01:14.270> shoots<00:01:14.630> it's

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
v-twin on these little point shoots it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.390 
v-twin on these little point shoots it's
gotta<00:01:15.020> shoot<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.590> well<00:01:15.860> though<00:01:16.070> doesn't

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
gotta shoot really well though doesn't

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.130 
gotta shoot really well though doesn't
it<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.729> does<00:01:16.790> shoot<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:17.540> trying<00:01:17.930> to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
it it does shoot it's just trying to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.840 
it it does shoot it's just trying to
find<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.590> balance<00:01:18.650> point<00:01:18.920> between<00:01:19.160> getting

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
find that balance point between getting

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.090 
find that balance point between getting
the<00:01:19.940> gearing<00:01:20.119> set<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.010> traction<00:01:22.010> control

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the gearing set and the traction control

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.340 
the gearing set and the traction control
set<00:01:22.520> up<00:01:22.610> where<00:01:22.880> we're<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.330> wheeling<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.229> not

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
set up where we're just wheeling and not

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
set up where we're just wheeling and not
overdoing<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.130> not<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.520> know<00:01:25.610> limiting<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
overdoing it not you know limiting the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.420 
overdoing it not you know limiting the
acceleration<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.140> getting<00:01:27.979> as<00:01:28.100> close<00:01:28.220> to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
acceleration but getting as close to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.920 
acceleration but getting as close to
that<00:01:28.550> wheelie<00:01:28.820> point<00:01:29.030> as<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:29.210> can<00:01:29.390> without

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
that wheelie point as we can without

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.880 
that wheelie point as we can without
exceeding<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:31.000> now<00:01:32.000> you're<00:01:32.300> using<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:33.590> to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
exceeding it now you're using what to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.980 
exceeding it now you're using what to
help<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.430> with<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:35.210> bizarre<00:01:35.600> system

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
help you with that the bizarre system

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.140 
help you with that the bizarre system
yeah<00:01:36.560> we've<00:01:36.950> we've<00:01:37.400> been<00:01:37.520> doing<00:01:37.730> some<00:01:37.880> testing

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
yeah we've we've been doing some testing

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.430 
yeah we've we've been doing some testing
with<00:01:38.210> lozada's<00:01:38.660> traction<00:01:39.020> control<00:01:39.140> system

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
with lozada's traction control system

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.480 
with lozada's traction control system
and<00:01:39.830> it's<00:01:40.340> working<00:01:40.820> really<00:01:40.910> well<00:01:41.060> i<00:01:41.450> think<00:01:42.490> you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
and it's working really well i think you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.640 
and it's working really well i think you
know<00:01:43.520> as<00:01:43.760> i'm<00:01:44.240> tuning<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.810> I've<00:01:44.990> said<00:01:45.560> it

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
know as i'm tuning that I've said it

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.980 
know as i'm tuning that I've said it
real<00:01:45.770> aggressive<00:01:46.070> yesterday<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.720> felt

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
real aggressive yesterday and I felt

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.810 
real aggressive yesterday and I felt
like<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.260> maybe<00:01:48.590> was<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.159> was<00:01:49.250> made<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.550> easier

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
like it maybe was it was made it easier

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.430 
like it maybe was it was made it easier
to<00:01:49.940> ride<00:01:50.120> but<00:01:50.420> maybe<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:50.810> was<00:01:50.960> even<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.230> little

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
to ride but maybe I was even a little

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.899 
to ride but maybe I was even a little
bit<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.680> acceleration<00:01:52.190> because<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
bit of acceleration because of it so

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.550 
bit of acceleration because of it so
we're<00:01:53.390> trying<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.659> trim<00:01:53.840> back<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.020> settings<00:01:54.500> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
we're trying to trim back the settings a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.960 
we're trying to trim back the settings a
little<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.070> free<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.370> bike<00:01:55.490> up<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
little bit and free the bike up and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.399 
little bit and free the bike up and
hopefully<00:01:56.510> pick<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:56.990> little<00:01:57.140> more<00:01:57.200> speed

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
hopefully pick up a little more speed

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.100 
hopefully pick up a little more speed
today<00:01:57.730> yeah<00:01:58.730> because<00:01:58.909> you're<00:01:59.360> quite<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
today yeah because you're quite the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.020 
today yeah because you're quite the
tester<00:02:00.650> for<00:02:00.800> this<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.100> mean<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.490> they've

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
tester for this I mean this is they've

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.399 
tester for this I mean this is they've

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
learn that limit and experiment with the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.690 
learn that limit and experiment with the
you<00:02:43.790> know<00:02:44.200> making<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.440> rideable<00:02:45.770> but<00:02:46.130> not

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
you know making it rideable but not

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.510 
you know making it rideable but not
sacrificing<00:02:47.209> acceleration<00:02:48.069> well<00:02:49.069> awesome<00:02:49.430> we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
sacrificing acceleration well awesome we

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.550 
sacrificing acceleration well awesome we
hope<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.790> get<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.330> throttle<00:02:50.360> more<00:02:50.900> just
