00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.190
 the girls welcome to a new video 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.380
 in this opportunity we are going to make another 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.720
 case for our cell phone this time will be 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.160
 in cloth so let's use what 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 it's felt in these colors 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 a pencil scissors a bit of meter 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.420
 the server and the drawing you can use 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 for the eyes the buttons as we will do 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 a new pressure after the template 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.800
 owl 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 I'm going to use this one of the necklaces 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 what we did but I'm going to do it more 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 big and yes when hot so 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 let's start with our sleeve for 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.900
 be more girls than me first 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.970
 I did was take the measurements of my city 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.159
 this is the outline obviously I left a 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.470
 small centimeter on each side so 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.900
 stitching to make what I know 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.280
 another one but what I did was to do the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.920
 hole in the screen 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.740
 and I've cut a strip that will go to this 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.690
 around only I'm going to leave the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.350
 top part so this from here 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 let's sew 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.440
 good guys we finished sewing and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.410
 now he wants to change the stitching as they see 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.090
 it's an outward seam I tried it 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.950
 very unique and is fine one 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.260
 expensive little princess because he had 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.690
 this part was a little loose 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.700
 well then this guy that follows is that 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.010
 you can do with the image that you 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.290
 you want me to do this I'm going to 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.100
 make bigger 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 and since I want it to stay here 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.710
 so they know that I'm going to mark 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.840
 there are no blank circles 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.929
 for the little eyes 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.929
 in all the chronicles there are also 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.920
 some details and it just stays 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.920
 hit and ready 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.810
 and good here already cut different parts 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.510
 of the owl like beak eyes is third his 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.900
 pancita and paws so the only thing that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.100
 it is is to paste also I cut a band- aid 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.080
 I'm attached by the part here 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.970
 this so that it closes and this is where I'm going 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.680
 to paste this little strip once so 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.670
 let's start to paste and then to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.670
 decorate to our liking 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.900
 good girls to finish and decorate my 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.610
 found as vÃ©lez as a case around 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.340
 then add here also the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.170
 position of your album and the time that I 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.000
 I really like this result, it's very nice 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.650
 is one you already know that I'm going to leave 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
 photos so you can see how I started my 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.569
 cellular and then they can make the designs 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.770
 they want me I made another 15 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.050

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050
