purples and Greek eilers as well as some

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
purples and Greek eilers as well as some
gold<00:00:16.020> which<00:00:16.320> represents<00:00:16.980> her<00:00:17.070> jewelry<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
gold which represents her jewelry so the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.550 
gold which represents her jewelry so the
first<00:00:18.210> thing<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.449> did<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> platter<00:00:19.020> farmer

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
first thing I did was a platter farmer

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.010 
first thing I did was a platter farmer
and<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.550> stops<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:21.119> eyeshadows<00:00:21.660> from

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
and this just stops your eyeshadows from

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.130 
and this just stops your eyeshadows from
creasing<00:00:22.470> if<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.460> oily<00:00:23.640> lids<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.869> works

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
creasing if you have oily lids it works

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
creasing if you have oily lids it works
amazingly<00:00:25.619> farmhand<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> used<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.180> white

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
amazingly farmhand then I used a white

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
amazingly farmhand then I used a white
base<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.890> figured<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:29.939> make<00:00:30.119> all

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
base because I figured it would make all

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330 
base because I figured it would make all
the<00:00:30.510> colors<00:00:30.779> stand<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.070> used

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the colors stand out more if I just used

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.100 
the colors stand out more if I just used
like<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> purple<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.239> blue<00:00:33.540> would<00:00:33.719> only<00:00:33.870> make

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
like a purple or blue would only make

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
like a purple or blue would only make
certain<00:00:34.559> colors<00:00:34.890> pop<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.180> wouldn't

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
certain colors pop and this wouldn't

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
certain colors pop and this wouldn't
alter<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.620> i<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> 120

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
alter any of them then i use the 120

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
alter any of them then i use the 120
palette<00:00:38.670> i<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.149> figured<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.690> easy

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
palette i just figured that was easy

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.080 
palette i just figured that was easy
because<00:00:40.020> most<00:00:40.379> people<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
because most people have that so in the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
because most people have that so in the
second<00:00:42.540> layer<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> shadows<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.680> green<00:00:44.040> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
second layer of shadows the green that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
second layer of shadows the green that
is<00:00:44.460> six<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> second<00:00:45.960> row<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.440> one

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
is six and in the second row is the one

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.069 
is six and in the second row is the one
that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.829> used<00:00:47.129> looks<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.210> blew<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.629> camera

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that I used looks really blew on camera

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.040 
that I used looks really blew on camera
but<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> definitely<00:00:49.739> green<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> used<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but it's definitely green and I used it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
but it's definitely green and I used it
all<00:00:52.320> along<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.160> inner<00:00:53.399> third<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.210> eye<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
all along the inner third of my eye and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.250 
all along the inner third of my eye and
then<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> use<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.370> blue<00:00:56.640> color<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.809> /

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
then I use the blue color that's to /

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
then I use the blue color that's to /
from<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.399> center<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.000> after<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
from that in the center and after that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.760 
from that in the center and after that
we're<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> middle<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.199> eye<00:01:01.230> bit

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we're in the middle of my eye bit

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
we're in the middle of my eye bit
overlapping<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> grain<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.390> bit

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
overlapping on to the grain and a bit

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
overlapping on to the grain and a bit
into<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.589> outer<00:01:04.799> third<00:01:05.129> earth<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
into the outer third earth where I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
into the outer third earth where I
wanted<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> next<00:01:06.990> color<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.920> they

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
wanted the next color to be so that they

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
wanted the next color to be so that they
blend<00:01:08.400> flawlessly<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.750> i<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> purple

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
blend flawlessly then i use the purple

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.800 
blend flawlessly then i use the purple
um<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> second<00:01:12.060> color<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
um which is the second color and in the

um which is the second color and in the
next<00:01:13.080> row<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> very

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
next row down and i use that on the very

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
next row down and i use that on the very
outer<00:01:15.479> part<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> colors

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
outer part so you can see how the colors
kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.490> blend<00:01:17.759> seamlessly<00:01:18.140> then<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.530> to

the<00:01:19.710> top<00:01:20.009> layer<00:01:20.250> i<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.970> blue<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.479> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the top layer i use the blue that's in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
the top layer i use the blue that's in
the<00:01:21.810> second<00:01:22.200> row<00:01:22.350> second<00:01:22.950> from<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the second row second from the right and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.719 
the second row second from the right and
i<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.689> use<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.259> angle<00:01:25.740> brush<00:01:25.920> I've<00:01:26.189> kind

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
i just use that on angle brush I've kind

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.899 
i just use that on angle brush I've kind
of<00:01:26.850> encircle<00:01:27.630> door<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.080> case<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.979> shadow

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
of encircle door in case to my shadow

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
of encircle door in case to my shadow
with<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.420> color<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:32.100> find<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
with that color I just find that it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
with that color I just find that it
works<00:01:33.000> beautifully<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
works beautifully with this look and it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
works beautifully with this look and it
was<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.610> easy<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.939> blend<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> kind

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
was really easy to blend out and it kind

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
was really easy to blend out and it kind
of<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.320> goes<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of you know goes with all of them and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
of you know goes with all of them and
also<00:01:39.450> attempt<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.829> tones<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> down<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.460> bit

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
also attempt it tones it down a bit

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
also attempt it tones it down a bit
because<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> matte<00:01:42.540> color<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> rest

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because it's a matte color and the rest

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830 
because it's a matte color and the rest
are<00:01:43.439> relation<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:45.240> inner<00:01:45.450> corner

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
are relation then it for my inner corner

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
are relation then it for my inner corner
highlight<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:46.439> used<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.220> bottom<00:01:47.729> left<00:01:48.000> corner

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
highlight i used the bottom left corner

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.130 
highlight i used the bottom left corner
color<00:01:49.200> um<00:01:49.560> from<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> second<00:01:51.060> row<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.600> sheet

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
color um from the second row or sheet

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
color um from the second row or sheet
sorry<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> colors<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.479> put<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.840> on

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
sorry of colors and i just put that on

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
sorry of colors and i just put that on
before<00:01:55.470> blending<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> took<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
before blending and then I took the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.899 
before blending and then I took the
exact<00:01:57.570> opposite<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.009> very<00:01:59.219> top<00:01:59.579> left

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
exact opposite to that the very top left

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
exact opposite to that the very top left
as<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.390> under<00:02:00.840> bra<00:02:01.020> bond<00:02:01.259> highlight<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
as my under bra bond highlight and the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
as my under bra bond highlight and the
reason<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.340> places<00:02:02.790> first<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
reason I places first is because it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.810 
reason I places first is because it
makes<00:02:03.840> blending<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.500> lot<00:02:05.009> easier<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.610> there's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
makes blending a lot easier when there's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.330 
makes blending a lot easier when there's
something<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> blend<00:02:06.600> into

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
something to blend into

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.309 
something to blend into
so<00:02:07.969> that<00:02:08.179> was<00:02:08.330> kind<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.599> as<00:02:08.750> he<00:02:08.959> read<00:02:09.140> there

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
so that was kind of as he read there

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.009 
so that was kind of as he read there
then<00:02:10.190> after<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:11.060> moved<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.810> gold

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
then after that I moved on to the gold

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.630 
then after that I moved on to the gold
that's<00:02:12.260> underneath<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.980> eye<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> just

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
that's underneath the eye so I just

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.089 
that's underneath the eye so I just
placed<00:02:13.970> pure<00:02:14.330> gold<00:02:14.510> which<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> another<00:02:15.410> cream

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
placed pure gold which is another cream

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.500 
placed pure gold which is another cream
shadow<00:02:16.519> by<00:02:16.849> next<00:02:17.269> right<00:02:17.959> underneath<00:02:18.470> my<00:02:18.830> eye

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
shadow by next right underneath my eye

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.710 
shadow by next right underneath my eye
um<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.170> was<00:02:21.470> more<00:02:21.769> like<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.540> bronzy<00:02:23.540> gold

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
um and this was more like a bronzy gold

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.610 
um and this was more like a bronzy gold
and<00:02:24.140> then<00:02:24.290> i<00:02:24.560> used<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.690> bright<00:02:26.690> gold<00:02:27.019> from<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and then i used the bright gold from the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.650 
and then i used the bright gold from the
palate<00:02:28.129> isn't<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.580> first<00:02:28.819> layer<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.239> color<00:02:29.480> is

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
palate isn't the first layer of color is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.160 
palate isn't the first layer of color is
the<00:02:29.900> second<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.650> last<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:31.310> row<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.629> third

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the second to last I'm row and third

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.119 
the second to last I'm row and third
from<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.099> right<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.930> elf<00:02:36.140> liquid

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
from the right then I is the elf liquid

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.059 
from the right then I is the elf liquid
liner<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.330> did<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.629> really<00:02:38.989> dramatic<00:02:39.319> lang

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
liner and I did a really dramatic lang

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.670 
liner and I did a really dramatic lang
um<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:41.090> went<00:02:41.630> all<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.930> way<00:02:41.959> up<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.260> where<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
um I went all the way up to where the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.670 
um I went all the way up to where the
color<00:02:43.099> ends<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.660> i<00:02:45.019> winged<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.470> out

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
color ends and then I'm i winged it out

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.490 
color ends and then I'm i winged it out
obviously<00:02:46.310> that's<00:02:46.819> worth<00:02:47.030> something<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.720> I'm

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
obviously that's worth something and I'm

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.020 
obviously that's worth something and I'm
and<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.220> aligned<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.640> rest<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.910> my<00:02:50.000> eye

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and I just aligned the rest of my eye

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.410 
and I just aligned the rest of my eye
with<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:50.620> um<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.069> you<00:02:52.280> know<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.790> thought

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
with that um and then you know I thought

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.660 
with that um and then you know I thought
I'd<00:02:53.599> mix<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.379> bit<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.769> use<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> black<00:02:55.400> on

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
I'd mix it up a bit and use a black on

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.550 
I'd mix it up a bit and use a black on
my<00:02:55.849> tech<00:02:56.030> line<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.450> water<00:02:56.599> line<00:02:56.900> instead<00:02:57.410> of

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
my tech line of water line instead of

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.640 
my tech line of water line instead of
white<00:02:57.860> which<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:58.400> very<00:02:58.989> standard<00:02:59.989> for<00:03:00.260> me<00:03:00.410> and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
white which is very standard for me and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.380 
white which is very standard for me and
so<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:01.160> need<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.310> black<00:03:01.610> pencil<00:03:01.879> and<00:03:02.239> I

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
so I just need to black pencil and I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.759 
so I just need to black pencil and I
lined<00:03:02.900> those<00:03:03.230> um<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:05.239> don't<00:03:06.019> know<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.170> wasn't

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
lined those um and I don't know I wasn't

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.470 
lined those um and I don't know I wasn't
too<00:03:07.040> sure<00:03:07.069> what<00:03:07.459> how<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.700> looked<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.299> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
too sure what how it looked but it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.990 
too sure what how it looked but it
definitely<00:03:08.690> was<00:03:09.079> more<00:03:09.349> jasmine<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.849> know

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
definitely was more jasmine so you know

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.610 
definitely was more jasmine so you know
gotta<00:03:11.239> go<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:11.569> it<00:03:11.690> there<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.380> used

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
gotta go with it there and then I used

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.229 
gotta go with it there and then I used
my<00:03:12.769> scare<00:03:13.160> primer<00:03:13.489> which<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.940> don't<00:03:14.000> really

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
my scare primer which I don't really

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.720 
my scare primer which I don't really
think<00:03:14.569> I'd<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.620> all<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.069> much<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
think I'd like all that much but I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.400 
think I'd like all that much but I
haven't<00:03:17.030> used<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.420> enough<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:18.079> but<00:03:18.319> I'll

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
haven't used it enough to know but I'll

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.979 
haven't used it enough to know but I'll
