00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
let's put this stuff out of the way

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.150 
let's put this stuff out of the way
let's<00:03:13.049> show<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.140> how<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.380> worse<00:03:14.590> so

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
let's show you how this worse so

let's show you how this worse so
basically<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.299> have<00:03:16.420> your<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:16.720> Leela<00:03:16.959> here<00:03:17.140> if

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
basically you have your so Leela here if

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.780 
basically you have your so Leela here if
you<00:03:17.829> look<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.160> back<00:03:18.280> there's<00:03:18.519> also<00:03:18.640> a

what you do you get your close-up of
this<00:03:21.609> if<00:03:22.420> you've<00:03:22.600> charged<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.019> up<00:03:23.109> would<00:03:23.260> be

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
up on the screen there is one two three

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.349 
up on the screen there is one two three
and<00:03:32.500> flash<00:03:33.160> three<00:03:33.459> times<00:03:33.700> what<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> lets<00:03:34.269> you

and flash three times what that lets you

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.520 
and flash three times what that lets you
know<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.540> tells<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.049> how<00:03:35.200> much<00:03:35.319> battery

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
know that tells you how much battery

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.930 
know that tells you how much battery
power<00:03:35.709> you're<00:03:36.010> having<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.730> device

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
power you're having that in the device

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.819 
power you're having that in the device
the<00:03:37.630> clashes<00:03:37.989> five<00:03:38.200> times<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.769> a

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
the clashes five times you have a

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.080 
the clashes five times you have a
hundred<00:03:39.100> percent<00:03:39.160> battery<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.639> think<00:03:39.850> three

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
hundred percent battery I think three

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.180 
hundred percent battery I think three
times<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.480> about<00:03:40.630> sixty<00:03:41.019> percent<00:03:41.139> battery<00:03:41.530> so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
times is about sixty percent battery so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.319 
times is about sixty percent battery so
that's<00:03:42.370> how<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.519> know<00:03:42.670> how<00:03:42.850> much<00:03:43.030> battery

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
that's how you know how much battery

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.780 
that's how you know how much battery
life<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.600> left<00:03:43.959> in<00:03:44.109> here<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.579> here<00:03:45.700> on

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
so just one thing to keep in mind i

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.760 
so just one thing to keep in mind i
wouldn't<00:06:01.540> put<00:06:01.660> this<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:02.050> really<00:06:02.290> high<00:06:02.530> open

a<00:06:02.800> window<00:06:02.950> or<00:06:03.130> i<00:06:03.310> would<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:03.610> be<00:06:03.700> cautious

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
a window or i would just be cautious

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.880 
a window or i would just be cautious
about<00:06:04.060> what<00:06:04.150> you<00:06:04.300> stick<00:06:04.510> this<00:06:04.600> because<00:06:04.890> it

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
about what you stick this because it

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.340

could possibly fall so one thing to keep
in<00:06:08.470> mind<00:06:08.530> but<00:06:08.800> another<00:06:09.400> cool<00:06:09.580> thing<00:06:09.610> about<00:06:09.850> it

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
in mind but another cool thing about it
