from<00:00:00.900> time<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.230> time<00:00:01.260> what<00:00:02.159> I'm<00:00:02.250> using<00:00:02.429> my

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
from time to time what I'm using my

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.240 
from time to time what I'm using my
knives<00:00:02.850> come<00:00:03.810> across<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.080> result<00:00:04.560> which

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
knives come across a result which

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.660 
knives come across a result which
doesn't<00:00:05.910> make<00:00:06.000> any<00:00:06.150> sense<00:00:07.340> which<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> rather

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
doesn't make any sense which is a rather

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.720 
doesn't make any sense which is a rather
interesting<00:00:09.500> thing<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> happen<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.610> guys

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
interesting thing to happen you guys

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
interesting thing to happen you guys
basically<00:00:11.910> chose<00:00:12.420> there<00:00:12.780> something<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.200> on

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
basically chose there something going on

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.200 
basically chose there something going on
do<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.650> don't<00:00:13.830> understand<00:00:14.370> that's<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
do you don't understand that's a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.900 
do you don't understand that's a
positive<00:00:15.360> thing<00:00:15.660> cuz<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.560> shows<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.070> there's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
positive thing cuz it shows that there's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.189 
positive thing cuz it shows that there's
something<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.630> learn<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:18.990> or

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
something there you can learn from or

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960 
something there you can learn from or
benefit<00:00:19.529> from<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:20.310> you've<00:00:20.460> studied<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.789> little

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
benefit from if you've studied a little

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
benefit from if you've studied a little
bit<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> each<00:00:23.910> time

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
bit so what I'm going to do is each time

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.359 
bit so what I'm going to do is each time
I<00:00:24.390> find<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> these<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.680> just

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I find one of these little things just

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.679 
I find one of these little things just
put<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:26.939> challenge<00:00:27.359> videos

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
put up one of these challenge videos

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.519 
put up one of these challenge videos
where<00:00:28.320> I'll<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> problem<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.529> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
where I'll know what the problem is you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
where I'll know what the problem is you
can<00:00:31.650> participate<00:00:31.859> by<00:00:32.540> seeing<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.719> can

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
can participate by seeing if you can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.310 
can participate by seeing if you can
figure<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.200> out<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.120> then<00:00:36.120> once<00:00:36.420> someone<00:00:36.809> does

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
figure it out and then once someone does

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160 
figure it out and then once someone does
guess<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.309> correct<00:00:38.610> solution<00:00:39.059> I'll<00:00:39.870> put<00:00:40.140> up

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
guess the correct solution I'll put up

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
guess the correct solution I'll put up
in<00:00:40.440> detail<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> did<00:00:41.579> figure<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.879> that's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
in detail how I did figure out that's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.299 
in detail how I did figure out that's
why<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.010> checked

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
why it was going on and how he checked

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.180 
why it was going on and how he checked
it<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.170> challenge<00:00:46.379> video<00:00:46.800> was

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it so the first challenge video was

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.119 
it so the first challenge video was
relatively<00:00:47.610> simple<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> knife<00:00:49.620> from

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
relatively simple this is a knife from

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.150 
relatively simple this is a knife from
Phil<00:00:50.340> Wilson<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.090> CPM<00:00:51.629> 10v<00:00:52.460> 62.5<00:00:53.460> rockwell

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
Phil Wilson and CPM 10v 62.5 rockwell

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
Phil Wilson and CPM 10v 62.5 rockwell
phil<00:00:56.160> users<00:00:56.550> rather<00:00:56.850> high<00:00:57.449> temperature<00:00:57.840> sucks

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
phil users rather high temperature sucks

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.790 
phil users rather high temperature sucks
this<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.980> had<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> forced<00:00:59.460> air<00:00:59.609> quench

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
this one had a forced air quench

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.789 
this one had a forced air quench
extended<00:01:01.800> quench<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> liquid<00:01:03.000> nitrogen<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
extended quench and liquid nitrogen and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.509 
extended quench and liquid nitrogen and
relatively<00:01:04.799> low<00:01:04.979> temper

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
relatively low temper

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
relatively low temper
I<00:01:05.549> believe<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> might<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> been<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
I believe what this might have been a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
I believe what this might have been a
time<00:01:07.439> he<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.710> using<00:01:07.860> high<00:01:08.040> tempers<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> 10v

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
time he was using high tempers and 10v

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.250 
time he was using high tempers and 10v
100%<00:01:10.140> sure<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.299> any<00:01:12.420> case<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.049> grind

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
100% sure but in any case the grind

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.670 
100% sure but in any case the grind
ability<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.790> low<00:01:14.970> where<00:01:15.659> resistance<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
ability is very low where resistance is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.609 
ability is very low where resistance is
very<00:01:16.799> high<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> I've<00:01:19.080> been<00:01:19.170> doing<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.409> edge

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
very high so I've been doing some edge

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.260 
very high so I've been doing some edge
retention<00:01:19.740> runs<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> cardboard<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.939> results

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
retention runs on cardboard the results

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.700 
retention runs on cardboard the results
are<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> description<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.229> don't

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
are down in the description I don't

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
are down in the description I don't
notice<00:01:22.799> something<00:01:23.220> relatively<00:01:23.700> interesting

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
notice something relatively interesting

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 
notice something relatively interesting
when<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.780> every<00:01:24.990> sharpen<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> basic

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
when I go every sharpen it so the basic

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
when I go every sharpen it so the basic
procedure<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.869> outlined<00:01:28.170> before

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
procedure which I have outlined before

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
procedure which I have outlined before
it's<00:01:29.369> basically<00:01:29.729> take<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> knife<00:01:30.210> slice<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it's basically take the knife slice it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.039 
it's basically take the knife slice it
directly<00:01:32.009> across<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> stone<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.810> de-stress

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
directly across the stone to de-stress

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
directly across the stone to de-stress
the<00:01:34.350> edge<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.159> does<00:01:35.310> two<00:01:35.460> things<00:01:35.490> number<00:01:36.000> one

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the edge that does two things number one

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.870 
the edge that does two things number one
it<00:01:36.509> grinds<00:01:36.930> away<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.920> weekend<00:01:38.310> Bank<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it grinds away all the weekend Bank the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
it grinds away all the weekend Bank the
chipped<00:01:39.150> metal<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.530> earthing<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.040> keeps<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
chipped metal the earthing it keeps the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
chipped metal the earthing it keeps the
edge<00:01:41.820> relatively<00:01:42.509> flat<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
edge relatively flat or with the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
edge relatively flat or with the
existing<00:01:43.979> curvature<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.850> stops<00:01:45.180> any<00:01:45.360> hollow

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
existing curvature it stops any hollow

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
existing curvature it stops any hollow
points<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.110> recurves<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.799> setting<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.310> the

points or recurves from setting into the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.719 
points or recurves from setting into the
edge<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.720> interesting<00:01:49.200> thing<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.729> this

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
edge the interesting thing is this this

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.499 
edge the interesting thing is this this
is<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.509> cheap<00:01:52.049> stone<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.640> very<00:01:53.880> non

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
is a very cheap stone it's a very non

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
is a very cheap stone it's a very non
abrasive<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.380> slow<00:01:55.619> cutting<00:01:56.009> stone<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> the

abrasive or slow cutting stone and the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
abrasive or slow cutting stone and the
reason<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.899> has<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.500> high<00:01:58.740> binder

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
reason is that it has a very high binder

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
reason is that it has a very high binder
content<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.149> doesn't<00:02:00.180> release<00:02:00.719> fresher

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
content it doesn't release fresher
