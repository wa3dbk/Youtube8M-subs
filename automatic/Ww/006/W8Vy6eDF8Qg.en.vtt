00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
what do you feel up to us to maintain a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.600 
what do you feel up to us to maintain a
loose<00:00:03.360> leash<00:00:06.440> what<00:00:07.440> if<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.680> strive<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.040> use<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
loose leash what if we strive to use the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.580 
loose leash what if we strive to use the
leash<00:00:08.849> as<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> backup<00:00:09.570> or<00:00:09.870> safety<00:00:10.139> device

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
leash as a backup or safety device

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.180 
leash as a backup or safety device
instead<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.730> steering<00:00:12.059> wheel<00:00:13.009> what<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.099> we

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
instead of a steering wheel what if we

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.950 
instead of a steering wheel what if we
just<00:00:14.370> pretend<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> leash<00:00:15.269> wasn't<00:00:15.719> even

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
just pretend that the leash wasn't even

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
just pretend that the leash wasn't even
there<00:00:16.170> what<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.690> if<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.140> live

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
there what would it look like if we live

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.210 
there what would it look like if we live
with<00:00:19.590> several<00:00:20.039> dogs<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:21.090> might<00:00:21.300> walk<00:00:21.570> each<00:00:21.779> dog

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
with several dogs we might walk each dog

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.310 
with several dogs we might walk each dog
individually<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.600> each<00:00:24.750> dog<00:00:25.019> could

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
individually so that each dog could

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
individually so that each dog could
choose<00:00:25.560> his/her<00:00:25.920> own<00:00:25.980> pace<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> ability<00:00:28.880> we

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
choose his/her own pace and ability we

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
choose his/her own pace and ability we
might<00:00:30.090> pick<00:00:30.269> quiet<00:00:30.630> times<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.590> walking

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
might pick quiet times to go for walking

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
might pick quiet times to go for walking
like<00:00:32.969> cool<00:00:33.329> grizzly<00:00:33.930> days<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.530> early<00:00:34.860> horn<00:00:35.100> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
like cool grizzly days the early horn is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.180 
like cool grizzly days the early horn is
when<00:00:35.430> fewer<00:00:35.670> people<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.829> less<00:00:37.829> things<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
when fewer people are out less things to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
when fewer people are out less things to
distract<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> dog<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.899> would<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> be

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
distract the dog we would need to be

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.650
