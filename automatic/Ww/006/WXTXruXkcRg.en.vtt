easier<00:00:12.360> than<00:00:12.719> answering<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.290> same<00:00:13.410> question

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
easier than answering the same question

actually<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> rewrite<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> action

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
actually a rewrite of all the action

actually a rewrite of all the action
bars<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> game<00:00:28.439> meaning<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> can

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
bars in the game meaning that you can

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
bars in the game meaning that you can
customize<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.390> however<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.500> seeing

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
customize it however you like but seeing

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
customize it however you like but seeing
that<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.640> already<00:00:32.969> written<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.540> work<00:00:33.719> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that it's already written to work with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
that it's already written to work with
Spartan<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.460> any

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
Spartan you really don't need to do any

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.630 
Spartan you really don't need to do any
customization<00:00:36.950> unless<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
customization unless you really want to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.450 
customization unless you really want to
I<00:00:38.670> guess<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.620> also<00:00:40.829> thought<00:00:41.070> I'd<00:00:41.190> take<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I guess but I also thought I'd take the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.709 
I guess but I also thought I'd take the
opportunity<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.120> through<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.390> couple<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
opportunity to go through a couple of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
opportunity to go through a couple of
the<00:00:42.840> settings<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> set<00:00:44.219> for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the settings that I do like to set for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
the settings that I do like to set for
each<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.760> characters<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
each of my characters that I like to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.650 
each of my characters that I like to
play<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.700> chose<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.850> character<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> use

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
play a lot I chose this character to use

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
play a lot I chose this character to use
because<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.410> first<00:00:49.559> character<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because it's a very first character I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.250 
because it's a very first character I
actually<00:00:50.219> created<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.969> WoW<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.989> haven't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
actually created in WoW and I haven't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
actually created in WoW and I haven't
really<00:00:52.469> played<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.860> since<00:00:53.039> 2005<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
really played it since 2005 which is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
really played it since 2005 which is
pretty<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.829> how<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> bars<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.399> look<00:00:56.640> when

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty much how the bars would look when

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.430 
pretty much how the bars would look when
you<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.239> install<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.170> add-ons<00:00:58.489> so

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
you first install the two add-ons so

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
you first install the two add-ons so
first<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:02.039> interface<00:01:02.730> add-ons

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
first of all go into interface add-ons

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
first of all go into interface add-ons
and<00:01:04.640> then<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:07.049> configure<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> scale<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and then to configure the scale which is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
and then to configure the scale which is
especially<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.240> wide<00:01:09.540> screens<00:01:09.930> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
especially good for wide screens like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.039 
especially good for wide screens like
this<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.490> click<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.479> or

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
this one here you just click that and or

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.789 
this one here you just click that and or
just<00:01:13.350> make<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.560> bar<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.369> narrower

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
just make the bar a little bit narrower

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
just make the bar a little bit narrower
next<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> general

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
next thing I like to do is go to general

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.960 
next thing I like to do is go to general
action<00:01:19.920> bars<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:22.400> toggle<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.580> these<00:01:23.939> two

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
action bars and toggle off these two

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.749 
action bars and toggle off these two
bars<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.590> hides<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.250> background

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
bars which actually hides the background

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.710 
bars which actually hides the background
boxes<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:28.909> looks<00:01:29.909> especially<00:01:30.479> nice<00:01:30.689> when

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
boxes here looks especially nice when

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
boxes here looks especially nice when
you<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.259> actually<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> slots

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you don't actually use all of the slots

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.010 
you don't actually use all of the slots
I<00:01:33.650> find<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.369> pop-up<00:01:35.820> animations<00:01:36.509> which

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I find and then pop-up animations which

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.580 
I find and then pop-up animations which
are<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:37.920> bars<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.290> actually<00:01:40.290> don't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
are these two bars here I actually don't

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
are these two bars here I actually don't
like<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> toggle<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> normally

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
like the way that a toggle so I normally

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.319 
like the way that a toggle so I normally
leave<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:43.079> showing<00:01:43.759> 100<00:01:44.759> percent<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
leave them showing 100 percent of the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
leave them showing 100 percent of the
time<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:47.040> easy<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.460> fix<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
time so that's very easy to fix just

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
time so that's very easy to fix just
uncheck<00:01:48.090> these<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.540> boxes<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.409> once<00:01:50.159> again<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
uncheck these two boxes and once again I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.749 
uncheck these two boxes and once again I
like<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.240> hide<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> backgrounds<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.159> just

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
like to hide the backgrounds so just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.250 
like to hide the backgrounds so just
select<00:01:54.119> zero<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:55.140> both<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:55.590> settings

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
select zero for both of those settings

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.830 
select zero for both of those settings
and<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.730> last<00:01:58.940> thing<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.690> normally

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and then the last thing that I normally

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.550 
and then the last thing that I normally
do<00:02:00.410> is<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.300> uncheck<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.540> spin<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:03.140> which<00:02:03.410> is

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
do is to uncheck the spin can which is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.080 
do is to uncheck the spin can which is
basically<00:02:03.980> what<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.340> would<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.940> go

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
basically what you would see when you go

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.320 
basically what you would see when you go
afk<00:02:06.220> generally<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.370> spins<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:08.030> scene

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
afk generally just spins the scene

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.380 
afk generally just spins the scene
around<00:02:08.540> wherever<00:02:09.290> you<00:02:09.470> are<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.210> can<00:02:11.210> illustrate

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
around wherever you are I can illustrate

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.260 
around wherever you are I can illustrate
that<00:02:11.990> here<00:02:12.050> or<00:02:12.950> demonstrate<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:14.060> by<00:02:14.210> doing

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
that here or demonstrate just by doing

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.360 
that here or demonstrate just by doing
that<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.350> as<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.010> see<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.340> just

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that you can as you can see you can just

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.520 
that you can as you can see you can just
manually<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:17.240> yourself<00:02:17.720> toggle<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.320> on<00:02:18.470> and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
manually do it yourself toggle it on and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.210 
manually do it yourself toggle it on and
off<00:02:18.740> whenever<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.280> want<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:20.710> it's<00:02:21.710> quite<00:02:22.190> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
off whenever you want to it's quite a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.160 
off whenever you want to it's quite a
nice<00:02:22.430> effect<00:02:22.670> actually<00:02:23.300> if<00:02:23.390> you're<00:02:23.540> filming
