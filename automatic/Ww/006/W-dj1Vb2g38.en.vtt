00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
liked it I thought it was okay but it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.680 
liked it I thought it was okay but it
definitely<00:02:23.250> reads<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> younger<00:02:24.270> writer

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and for this there were parts that felt

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.870 
and for this there were parts that felt
a<00:02:28.290> little<00:02:28.320> forced<00:02:28.740> for<00:02:28.890> me<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.520> because

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
a little forced for me as if because

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.479 
a little forced for me as if because
they've<00:02:30.270> had<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.650> their<00:02:31.860> minds<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> entire

time this is how it's gonna end that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.229 
time this is how it's gonna end that
there<00:02:34.470> was<00:02:34.560> no<00:02:34.680> real<00:02:34.950> way<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.489> changing<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
there was no real way of changing it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.540 
there was no real way of changing it

yeah<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.360> feel<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.200> very<00:02:40.290> cinematic

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
yeah but I feel like it's very cinematic

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.380 
yeah but I feel like it's very cinematic
the<00:02:41.100> way<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.400> end<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.910> seemed<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.300> the
