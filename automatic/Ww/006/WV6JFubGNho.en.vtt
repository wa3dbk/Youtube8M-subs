Sun crisp has a tendency to tendency to

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:25.620 
Sun crisp has a tendency to tendency to
be<00:01:23.679> biennial<00:01:24.340> bearing<00:01:24.549> so<00:01:25.029> you<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.450> watch

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
be biennial bearing so you have to watch

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
be biennial bearing so you have to watch
that<00:01:25.959> and<00:01:26.229> make<00:01:26.439> sure<00:01:26.469> it's<00:01:26.679> thinned<00:01:27.399> properly

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that and make sure it's thinned properly

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.449 
that and make sure it's thinned properly
it's<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.789> fresh<00:01:31.060> eating<00:01:31.420> apple<00:01:31.810> for<00:01:31.990> sure<00:01:32.459> it

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
it's a fresh eating apple for sure it

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.089 
it's a fresh eating apple for sure it
would<00:01:33.579> also<00:01:33.729> make<00:01:34.029> good<00:01:34.149> cider<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.740> it's

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
would also make good cider but it's it's

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.889 
would also make good cider but it's it's
it's<00:01:36.399> grown<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:37.029> don't<00:01:37.149> want<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.329> say<00:01:37.450> rarely

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
it's grown I don't want to say rarely

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.230 
it's grown I don't want to say rarely
but<00:01:38.139> there<00:01:38.409> aren't<00:01:38.619> any<00:01:38.920> big<00:01:39.369> orchards<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.090> it

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
but there aren't any big orchards of it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
but there aren't any big orchards of it
so<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.719> a<00:01:40.990> niche<00:01:41.409> apple<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:43.329> Sun<00:01:43.599> crisp

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so it's a niche apple I think Sun crisp

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.149 
so it's a niche apple I think Sun crisp
is<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.310> good<00:01:45.609> or<00:01:45.789> better<00:01:45.999> than<00:01:46.299> Honey<00:01:46.509> Crisp<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
is as good or better than Honey Crisp it

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.519 
is as good or better than Honey Crisp it
does<00:01:48.369> ripen<00:01:48.819> late<00:01:49.090> typically<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.929> week<00:01:50.200> or<00:01:50.380> two

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.529 
does ripen late typically a week or two

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:54.149 
does ripen late typically a week or two
after<00:01:50.679> Columbus<00:01:51.310> Day<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.669> Massachusetts<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
again just looking at the fruit it's a

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.959 
again just looking at the fruit it's a
conical<00:01:56.319> fruit<00:01:56.619> shape<00:01:56.919> it's<00:01:57.219> quite<00:01:57.520> clean<00:01:57.939> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
it ripens up

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.120
