down<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.740> setting<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> doesn't<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
down the setting so it doesn't have all

find if I were playing this on a
full-size<00:01:16.080> notebook<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.310> much

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
full-size notebook that would be much

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
full-size notebook that would be much
more<00:01:17.580> expensive<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
more expensive but you can see that you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260 
more expensive but you can see that you
get<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.520> emotion<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
get some pretty good emotion out of it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
get some pretty good emotion out of it
you<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.810> high<00:01:22.020> frame<00:01:22.320> rates<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> long<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you get high frame rates as long as you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
you get high frame rates as long as you
tone<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.540> special<00:01:24.869> textures

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

tone down some of those special textures
and<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> special<00:01:26.909> effects<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and some of the special effects but you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
and some of the special effects but you
know<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.460> interested<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:29.970> the
