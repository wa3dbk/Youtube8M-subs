 making calls and doing research in 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.570
 web 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.840
 will you marry me 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.670
 hard question 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.690
 let's have a child 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:42.980
 I can't call you yours 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:45.200

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.120

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.430
 you always suck 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.440
 I hope your judgment does not derive from 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 I did something else here, try to 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.180
 apologize but at least what happened then 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.690
 there is also a problem that is when the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.680
 say something like look for me a pizzeria 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.840

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 program really stupid 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:48.940
 a second reason on which one if so 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.940
 useless and useful for nothing 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.970
 let me do an internet search for 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.769
 find a reason answer on which I am 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.350
