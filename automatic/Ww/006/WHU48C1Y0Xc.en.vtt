00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
home for 10 to 15 minutes at a time you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
home for 10 to 15 minutes at a time you
place<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> hair<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.470> actually

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
place that on the hair and it actually

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
place that on the hair and it actually
beeps<00:01:29.130> every<00:01:29.490> 45<00:01:29.939> seconds<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
beeps every 45 seconds and then you just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
beeps every 45 seconds and then you just
shift<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.549> how<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> energy<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
shift it and that's how the energy is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
shift it and that's how the energy is
transferred<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> hair<00:01:34.350> after<00:01:35.159> four
