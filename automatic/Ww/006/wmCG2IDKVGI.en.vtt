00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
high hopes for this product because it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
high hopes for this product because it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
looks so beautiful on the swatch but

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
looks so beautiful on the swatch but
when<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> tried<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> came<00:00:41.040> out

completely<00:00:41.309> patchy<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.390> uneven<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> had

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
completely patchy and uneven that I had

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
completely patchy and uneven that I had
to<00:00:44.399> dye<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.760> hair<00:00:44.789> twice<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to dye my hair twice and even on the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.090 
to dye my hair twice and even on the
second<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.100> still<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.640> patchy<00:00:48.050> the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
second time it was still very patchy the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
second time it was still very patchy the
unfortunate<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
unfortunate thing about it is that as I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
unfortunate thing about it is that as I
wash<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.960> hair<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.469> started<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> fade<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.460> hair

kind of a dingy Brown in some spots

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.549 
kind of a dingy Brown in some spots
which<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.719> didn't<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
which I really didn't like and when I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
which I really didn't like and when I
tried<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> completely<00:00:59.430> remove<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.449> left<00:01:00.930> my

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tried to completely remove it it left my

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
tried to completely remove it it left my
hair<00:01:01.350> green<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
product because I think it has an

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
product because I think it has an
underlying<00:01:05.129> green<00:01:05.460> tone<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.330> great

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
underlying green tone which is not great

tube it is blue compared to Provence
mystical<00:01:32.549> mint<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> clearly<00:01:33.360> green<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
mystical mint which is clearly green and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
mystical mint which is clearly green and
that<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> issue<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.820> had<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that was kind of the issue I had with it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
that was kind of the issue I had with it
I<00:01:36.570> had<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> dilute<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I had to dilute it a little bit with the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.030 
I had to dilute it a little bit with the
clear<00:01:38.640> dilute<00:01:39.210> err<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> didn't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
clear dilute err just so that it didn't

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
clear dilute err just so that it didn't
appear<00:01:41.250> blue<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.610> hair<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> do

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
appear blue on my hair but if you do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
appear blue on my hair but if you do
have<00:01:43.020> pre-existing<00:01:43.979> green<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:44.939> hair

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
have pre-existing green in your hair

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
have pre-existing green in your hair
already<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> hair<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.409> faded<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
already like your hair is faded and it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
already like your hair is faded and it's
still<00:01:47.399> green<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.420> it'll<00:01:48.570> still<00:01:48.689> make

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
still green I think it'll still make

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
still green I think it'll still make
your<00:01:49.259> mint<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:49.799> green<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.670> you're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
your mint look green but if you're

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
your mint look green but if you're
putting<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.360> platinum<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.049> blonde<00:01:52.320> white

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
putting it on platinum like blonde white

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
putting it on platinum like blonde white
hair<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.240> hair<00:01:54.420> blue

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
hair it's going to make your hair blue

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
hair it's going to make your hair blue
that's<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.409> downfall<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.130> you're

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that's the only downfall so if you're

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
that's the only downfall so if you're
looking<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.210> green<00:01:57.479> mint

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
looking for kind of like a green mint

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
looking for kind of like a green mint
this<00:01:58.860> probably<00:01:59.250> isn't<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> color<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
this probably isn't the color for you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
this probably isn't the color for you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.420 
my opinion the bright and vibrant colors
last<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.110> lot<00:02:43.260> longer<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> don't<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
last a lot longer so you don't have to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
last a lot longer so you don't have to
read<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:44.850> hair<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.150> often<00:02:45.450> than<00:02:45.570> the

read I your hair as often than the
pastels<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> plus<00:02:47.460> for<00:02:47.670> me

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760

but I have a lot of regrowth and the
reason<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.060> because<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.630> don't<00:04:03.840> bleach

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110

look<00:05:32.700> bad<00:05:33.000> with<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.360> hair<00:05:33.600> color<00:05:33.810> if

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
look bad with this hair color if

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.840 
look bad with this hair color if
anything<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.530> think<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.950> gives<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.370> different

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
anything I think it gives it a different

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.719 
anything I think it gives it a different
dimension<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:37.289> really<00:05:37.530> complements<00:05:38.220> the

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
dimension and it really complements the

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.409 
dimension and it really complements the
blue<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.870> that's<00:05:40.860> just<00:05:41.010> my<00:05:41.190> opinion<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:42.060> pros

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
blue so that's just my opinion the pros

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.420 
blue so that's just my opinion the pros
for<00:05:42.840> this<00:05:42.990> product<00:05:43.289> overall<00:05:43.800> is<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.280> it
