00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 the opponent we are really going to encounter 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.609
 especially if you have a slightly better opponent 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.709
 is going to play 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.969
 is that he hits a little harder than what you're used to 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.019
 I have players who notice its existence if you do 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.659
 yes there is so bad 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.739
 a problem for you 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.789
 there are people who have made a psychotic of it 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 and call it straight heterosexuals 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 heerkes 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.080
 the specialists 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 hit the ball in the heart 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.380
 for such persons 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.380
 the vegt store must read reasonably think about 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.450
 the balconies even if that works 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.970
 So now we need the technology 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.040
 what bought in maybe because of the ball 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.480
 rather with us is the rise 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 we must take into account 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040
 and not the time to turn a carpenter into a bed 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.660
 when the ball is making very little hair you could try to make it 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.490
 a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.230
 standard technology 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.960
 to continue to use 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.969
 but nothing i want to end up waving behind so we think of it 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 actor 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.710
 impression you taste others feel now waving a lot to do 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.659
 what there 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.449
 you lose little time with it mainly is the size of the rear car 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.630
 a walker case compared to the time you get from the opponent 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.390
 when the behind spain even though you make a small one is not sufficient 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.850
 the control that you get from it 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.220
 on the bar is definitely not improved 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.049
 we're going to talk about a rear spoiler 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.689
 and we talk about it and you have to 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 bullock 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.499
 block the scheme 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.079
 when you can only reach the record behind the ball 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.079
 and let the ball close against it 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.989
 but those blocks are swinging 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.299
 used we must camp back 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.299
 a counter technique 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.429
 I think like you 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.539
 Court starts training on someone who plays Hardenberg's ball after and on 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.249
 you will spend less time 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.239
 and therefore not in the sign 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.539
 a small pass in March that you get one is a completely different game 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.079
 what else can I do 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.029
 those who know hard 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.599
 no, I think it is really painful 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.230
 if that ball were already 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.840
 so just come back to standard again 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.529
 made 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:16.290
 I say special product made because that can be a keyword for you 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.289
 the lowness that you have to avoid 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.589
 but a book about acceptable 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:23.999
 I would say 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.069
 grathem her twitterers 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.399
 the ball to high 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.399
 play high 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.990
 absolutely 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.830
 that ball that goes higher he comes from higher and who works hard for mother 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.540
 once 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.400
 to be able to adjust his game 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 because a falling ball is harder to time 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.719
 you are slowing down 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.919
 exactly right 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.999
 because of the high ball at the speed that bad luck wants its twitter 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.639
 so perfect 9 anti tactics 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 which direction 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.559
 well direction 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:13.059
 whoever has the bar does not in principle have to deviate much anymore, only 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.499
 until the ball comes in hard 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.499
 you should not play it sharp 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.769
 the lake 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.499
 and do that if you have played more by holding more now 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:31.969
 No 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 play the trick 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.620
 h how are you going to practice this 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.240
 this player 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.569
 the contractor 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.569
 you're back hard 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.160
 the ball will 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.469
 walkers 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.129
 he come in 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.240
 and you are the one who 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.169
 time is going to make time is going on among its members after playing higher and 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.000
 of course a little less faithful 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 the ball goes back that does not rise anymore 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.580
 and must stay 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.879
 so long 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.430
 because of this too much together to practice and function to turn Sony readers want 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:20.209
 easier also can understand with others this game will do even more why 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.499
 but her twitter are going to get into trouble because I'm going to feel you 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.099
 well if you were on time in the race to bet you will see that it is hard 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.770
 back again hey 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.130
 get more resistance m maybe his heart beats hard less the card 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.460
 use 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.410
 but in 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.960
 it is important that you train 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.729
 you need this game principle m that you need training first 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.649
 so it's not just because I said 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.550
 that it will work out with you you must train this train train train 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.469
 toppertje 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.849
 have mastered it completely 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:05:59.620
 good luck with it
