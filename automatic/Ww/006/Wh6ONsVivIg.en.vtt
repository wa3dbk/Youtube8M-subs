00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
same of stuff right here you keep like

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.310 
same of stuff right here you keep like
looking<00:02:25.519> really<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.540> though<00:02:26.690> i<00:02:26.720> stuff

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
looking really like it though i stuff

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.640 
looking really like it though i stuff
then<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.959> how<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.380> draw

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
then you do that and that's how you draw

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.509 
then you do that and that's how you draw
the<00:02:30.709> read<00:02:31.280> WS<00:02:31.820> logo<00:02:32.830> well<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> guess<00:02:34.220> that's<00:02:34.430> how

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
the read WS logo well I guess that's how

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.290 
the read WS logo well I guess that's how
you<00:02:34.700> try<00:02:35.030> it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
you try it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:57.870 
you try it
whatever<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.410> just<00:02:36.769> do<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> same<00:02:37.220> thing<00:02:46.209> again

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.400 

Jericho<00:03:01.180> w1<00:03:02.180> which<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.540> more<00:03:02.750> easier<00:03:03.110> for<00:03:03.320> me

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
Jericho w1 which is more easier for me

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.009 
Jericho w1 which is more easier for me
but<00:03:04.100> there<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.640> fifth<00:03:04.970> time<00:03:05.269> or<00:03:05.540> 20th

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
but there is that my fifth time or 20th

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.319 
but there is that my fifth time or 20th
time<00:03:06.320> joined<00:03:07.100> at<00:03:07.280> 30<00:03:07.549> wf1

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
time joined at 30 wf1

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.050 
time joined at 30 wf1
so<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.019> not<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:09.500> funny<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.880> let

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
so it's not really that funny just let

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:26.949 
so it's not really that funny just let
me<00:03:14.230> do<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.350> same<00:03:15.500> stuff

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:35.809
