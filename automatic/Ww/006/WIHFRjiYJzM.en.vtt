in Chicago he's a big Bears fan but I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.569 
in Chicago he's a big Bears fan but I

think he would easily say that the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.619 
think he would easily say that the
Niners<00:00:59.879> are<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> able<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> pull<00:01:00.570> this

Niners are gonna be able to pull this
game<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.920> looked<00:01:02.190> at

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
game out I think that if you looked at

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
game out I think that if you looked at
both<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> Niners<00:01:03.300> played<00:01:03.329> week<00:01:03.750> one

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
both the way the Niners played week one

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
both the way the Niners played week one
they<00:01:04.619> showed<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> play<00:01:05.309> against<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
they showed up the play against the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
they showed up the play against the
Dallas<00:01:05.970> Cowboys<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> team<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
Dallas Cowboys a team that a lot of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.120 
Dallas Cowboys a team that a lot of
people<00:01:08.250> thought<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:09.229> not<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> real<00:01:10.530> real<00:01:10.890> high

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
people thought was not a real real high

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
people thought was not a real real high
caliber<00:01:11.670> team<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> give

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
caliber team but I think when you give

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
caliber team but I think when you give
away<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> game<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.799> quarter<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
away the game in the first quarter the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
away the game in the first quarter the
way<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> Cowboys<00:01:15.330> did<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.810> you're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
way the Cowboys did when you're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
way the Cowboys did when you're
basically<00:01:16.490> minutes<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.299> down

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
basically minutes in and you're down

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
basically minutes in and you're down
21-0<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.159> hard<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> come<00:01:20.729> back

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
21-0 is going to be hard to come back

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
21-0 is going to be hard to come back
from<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.659> people<00:01:22.140> say<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:22.710> want

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
from that and people say what they want

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.270 
from that and people say what they want
to<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.340> Tony<00:01:23.729> Romo<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to say about Tony Romo but I I think the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
to say about Tony Romo but I I think the
cowboys<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.850> bounce<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.659> think

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
cowboys can bounce back I don't think

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
cowboys can bounce back I don't think
they're<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> great<00:01:28.229> team<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> east<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.210> but

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
they're a great team in the east but but

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.910 
they're a great team in the east but but
I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.659> definitely<00:01:30.869> they're<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.619> win<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I think definitely they're gonna win a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
I think definitely they're gonna win a
few<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.180> Niners<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:33.869> win<00:01:34.049> their

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
few and the Niners got a good win their

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
few and the Niners got a good win their

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
honestly I think could be a playoff team

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.069 
honestly I think could be a playoff team
there<00:01:38.430> Owen<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.360> definitely<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.869> want

passing game is it is probably gonna

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.240 
passing game is it is probably gonna
