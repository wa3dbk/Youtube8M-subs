all right no as I promised I said we'd
open<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:36.719> ileum<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.160> go

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
open up the the ileum and here we go

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
open up the the ileum and here we go
opening<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> ileum<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.200> going

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
opening up the ileum what you're going

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.360 
opening up the ileum what you're going
to<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.469> inside<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> structure<00:00:41.129> called<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to see inside is a structure called the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.119 
to see inside is a structure called the
spiral<00:00:41.850> valve<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> notice<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
spiral valve and you notice how that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
spiral valve and you notice how that
when<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> ileum<00:00:44.730> comes<00:00:44.940> open<00:00:45.239> there's<00:00:45.480> these

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
when the ileum comes open there's these

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
when the ileum comes open there's these
there's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.140> sheet<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:46.739> horizontal

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
there's a sheet these horizontal

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
there's a sheet these horizontal
vertical<00:00:47.760> sheets<00:00:48.559> those<00:00:49.559> cheats<00:00:49.860> force<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
vertical sheets those cheats force the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
vertical sheets those cheats force the
food<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> corkscrew<00:00:51.270> path<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.780> instead

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
food to take a corkscrew path so instead

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
food to take a corkscrew path so instead
of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> food<00:00:52.530> coming<00:00:52.770> straight<00:00:53.190> through<00:00:53.660> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
of the food coming straight through it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.279 
of the food coming straight through it
goes<00:00:54.899> spiral<00:00:55.440> spiral<00:00:55.649> spirals<00:00:56.219> file<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.550> well

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
goes spiral spiral spirals file as well

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.770 
goes spiral spiral spirals file as well
so<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.890> effect<00:00:59.550> increases<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> surface<00:01:00.539> area

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so it effect increases the surface area

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
so it effect increases the surface area
and<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> increases<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and it increases the kind of a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
and it increases the kind of a
functional<00:01:03.180> length<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> ilium<00:01:04.880> up<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
functional length of the ilium up on the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.530 
functional length of the ilium up on the
anterior<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.049> oh<00:01:07.460> what<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> male<00:01:08.790> here

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
anterior and we have oh what a male here

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
anterior and we have oh what a male here
we<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> test<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.650> there's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
we have a test this right here there's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
we have a test this right here there's
another<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.340> who<00:01:11.549> ripped<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.210> another

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
another one who ripped off this another

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.020 
another one who ripped off this another
one<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.260> comes<00:01:13.439> off

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
one the other side this one comes off

good<00:01:15.030> township<00:01:15.390> movers<00:01:15.860> detachable<00:01:16.860> testes

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
good township movers detachable testes

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.490 
good township movers detachable testes
we're<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> pericardial<00:01:19.350> cavity

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we're going up to the pericardial cavity

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
we're going up to the pericardial cavity
now<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.549> lost<00:01:20.759> camera<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
now we lost camera two up to the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
now we lost camera two up to the
pericardial<00:01:22.320> cavity<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
pericardial cavity and I know we're in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
pericardial cavity and I know we're in
the<00:01:23.700> pericardial<00:01:24.090> cavity<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.659> we've

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the pericardial cavity because we've

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
the pericardial cavity because we've
passed<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.439> structure<00:01:25.979> called<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.580> transverse

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
passed a structure called the transverse

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.359 
passed a structure called the transverse
septum<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.990> there's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> divider<00:01:28.650> between<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
septum so there's a divider between the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
septum so there's a divider between the
anterior<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.900> posterior<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> animal

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
anterior or the posterior of the animal

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.700 
anterior or the posterior of the animal
and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> pericardial<00:01:33.000> cavity<00:01:33.119> called<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
and the pericardial cavity called the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
and the pericardial cavity called the
transverse<00:01:34.710> septum<00:01:35.100> yeah<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.060> big<00:01:36.299> powerful

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
transverse septum yeah the big powerful

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
transverse septum yeah the big powerful
blood<00:01:37.439> pumping<00:01:37.770> part<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> heart<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
blood pumping part of the heart is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
blood pumping part of the heart is
called<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> ventricle<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.840> been<00:01:39.990> cut

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
called the ventricle and it's been cut

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.210 
called the ventricle and it's been cut
fortuitously<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:41.880> show<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> cut<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
fortuitously don't show the cut the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.679 
fortuitously don't show the cut the
blood<00:01:44.430> comes<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> heart<00:01:45.329> by<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
the CONUS arteriosus being shown by Dan
yeah<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.189> CONUS<00:01:50.610> arteriosus<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
yeah there it is CONUS arteriosus and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
yeah there it is CONUS arteriosus and
underneath<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.070> heart<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.930> couple

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
underneath the heart you have a couple

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.730 
underneath the heart you have a couple
we<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> blood<00:01:56.340> receiving<00:01:56.790> structure

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
we have a blood receiving structure

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.950 
we have a blood receiving structure
triangle<00:01:58.610> right<00:01:58.729> here<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:59.240> called<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> sinus

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
triangle right here is called the sinus

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.830 
triangle right here is called the sinus
venosus<00:02:00.909> so<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.000> blood<00:02:02.090> goes<00:02:02.270> into<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.570> sinus

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
venosus so the blood goes into the sinus

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.499 
venosus so the blood goes into the sinus
venosus<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.619> then<00:02:04.159> goes<00:02:04.399> into<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.000> atria

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
venosus and then goes into the atria

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.690 
venosus and then goes into the atria
where's<00:02:05.930> our<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.619> atrium<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.189> one<00:02:07.369> atrium

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
where's our the atrium is one atrium

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.210 
where's our the atrium is one atrium
very<00:02:08.119> big<00:02:08.349> usually<00:02:09.349> pillowy<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.860> one's<00:02:10.009> kind

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
very big usually pillowy this one's kind

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.370 
very big usually pillowy this one's kind
of<00:02:10.310> fallen<00:02:10.550> apart<00:02:10.759> there's<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> atrium<00:02:11.569> from

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
of fallen apart there's the atrium from

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.809 
of fallen apart there's the atrium from
the<00:02:12.500> atrium<00:02:12.800> then<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.220> ventricle<00:02:13.640> and

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
the atrium then to the ventricle and

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.699 
the atrium then to the ventricle and
from<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.269> ventricle<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.230> CONUS

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
from the ventricle to the CONUS

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.890 
from the ventricle to the CONUS
