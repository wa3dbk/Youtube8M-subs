so<00:00:05.350> let's<00:00:05.500> go<00:00:05.620> quickly<00:00:05.890> round<00:00:06.100> the<00:00:06.220> device<00:00:06.520> and

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
so let's go quickly round the device and

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.240 
so let's go quickly round the device and
a<00:00:07.180> talk<00:00:07.330> through<00:00:07.600> the<00:00:07.720> ports<00:00:08.170> and<00:00:08.410> we'll<00:00:09.129> open

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
a talk through the ports and we'll open

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.799 
a talk through the ports and we'll open
it<00:00:09.430> up<00:00:09.580> and<00:00:09.700> never<00:00:09.910> look<00:00:10.090> at<00:00:10.270> the<00:00:10.450> keyboard

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
it up and never look at the keyboard

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.049 
it up and never look at the keyboard
screen<00:00:11.320> after<00:00:11.469> that<00:00:11.800> so<00:00:12.550> here<00:00:12.670> we've<00:00:12.790> got<00:00:12.820> a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
screen after that so here we've got a

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.120 
screen after that so here we've got a

could be upgraded to fan input port

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.090 
could be upgraded to fan input port
there<00:01:00.360> so<00:01:01.360> let's<00:01:01.630> open<00:01:01.840> up<00:01:02.200> open<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:02.590> up<00:01:02.739> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
there so let's open up open it up the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.840 
there so let's open up open it up the
first<00:01:03.370> thing<00:01:03.520> you'll<00:01:03.640> see<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.509> fairly

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
first thing you'll see is is a fairly

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.030 
first thing you'll see is is a fairly
unusual<00:01:06.850> design<00:01:07.600> where<00:01:08.470> there's<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.740> whole

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
unusual design where there's a whole

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.930 
unusual design where there's a whole
London<00:01:09.370> eath<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.680> screen<00:01:11.680> here<00:01:11.979> as<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.850> can

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
London eath the screen here as you can

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.580 
London eath the screen here as you can
see<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.540> put<00:01:13.840> my<00:01:13.870> hand<00:01:14.229> through<00:01:14.320> there

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
see I can put my hand through there

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.469 
see I can put my hand through there
quite<00:01:15.070> easily<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.520> makes<00:01:15.729> quite<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.000> nice<00:01:16.240> way

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
quite easily it makes quite a nice way

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.960 
quite easily it makes quite a nice way
to<00:01:16.540> hold<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> device<00:01:17.370> so<00:01:18.370> you<00:01:18.430> can<00:01:18.580> actually

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
to hold the device so you can actually

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.690 
to hold the device so you can actually
type<00:01:19.780> one<00:01:19.990> handed<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.500> hold<00:01:20.680> one<00:01:21.220> handed<00:01:21.580> as

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
type one handed and hold one handed as

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700 
type one handed and hold one handed as
well<00:01:21.909> so<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:22.690> quite<00:01:22.960> unique<00:01:22.990> feature<00:01:23.530> of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
well so that's quite unique feature of

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.080 
well so that's quite unique feature of
this<00:01:24.540> keyboard<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.810> very<00:01:26.680> small<00:01:27.010> but<00:01:27.940> it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
this keyboard is very small but it's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.450 
this keyboard is very small but it's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
keyboards which which many people

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.190 
keyboards which which many people
including<00:01:39.130> myself<00:01:39.510> feel<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.810> about<00:01:41.049> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
including myself feel is about the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560 
including myself feel is about the
smallest<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.770> go<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.430> continue<00:01:43.240> to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
smallest you can go and continue to

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.380 
smallest you can go and continue to
touch<00:01:44.229> type<00:01:44.580> anything<00:01:45.580> smaller<00:01:46.030> than<00:01:46.119> that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
touch type anything smaller than that

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.780 
touch type anything smaller than that
and<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.659> gets<00:01:46.780> problematic<00:01:47.500> but<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.979> find<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.640> can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
and it gets problematic but I find I can

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.500 
and it gets problematic but I find I can
touch-type<00:01:49.000> on<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:50.020> much<00:01:50.200> problem

in this mode that you can actually use

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.980 
in this mode that you can actually use
it<00:02:25.740> without<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.460> out<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.880> table<00:02:27.090> hold
