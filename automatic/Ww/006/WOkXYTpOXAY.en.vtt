 breath always bigger than the defense has 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.140
 held up well with his elders 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 rescue on the line of anquilletti 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 but accused some serious skids 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 rejected and bigon intervenes to divert 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 on the net the referee judges foul 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.010
 the intervention of bigons and whistles one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.010
 punishment in favor of Lazio 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 fast the second goal action 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 marks rivera using touch of hair 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.910
 by punishment granted for foul up 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.489
 never 2 to 0 we are at the half hour of play 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 the Milan thinks to rest a moment 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 Lazio is not of this opinion e 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.300

 2 to 1 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.479
 the task of marking Jordanian 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 entrusted to collovati proved itself 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.740
 very ungrateful shooting with Milan 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 forward from hair to rivera and golden ball 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.320
 for calloni the 3 to 1 remains in the throat also 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 to neutral spectators Milan full of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.070
 problems also in defense 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970

 2 to 2 still Jordanian in evidence the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.140
 punta laziale gets rid of collovati 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.250
 enter the area without eagles tilo 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.670

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 team 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.159
 centering calloni finds space for the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.159
 shot 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.840
 pulici repels on the other ball 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.269
 intervention by Boldini and then by Bigon 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.130
