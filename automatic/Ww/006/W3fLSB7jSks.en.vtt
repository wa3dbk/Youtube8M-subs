so<00:00:02.639> here<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:04.040> bottom<00:00:05.040> end<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.420> two<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.870> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
so here is the bottom end of a two and a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.580 
so here is the bottom end of a two and a
half<00:00:07.080> liter<00:00:07.290> Chrysler<00:00:08.420> you<00:00:09.420> can<00:00:09.660> see<00:00:10.170> that's

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
half liter Chrysler you can see that's

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.660 
half liter Chrysler you can see that's
the<00:00:10.860> exhaust<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.090> donut<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.080> worn<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the exhaust the donut is worn on it and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.109 
the exhaust the donut is worn on it and
the<00:00:14.790> cats<00:00:15.000> probably<00:00:15.269> plugged<00:00:16.820> but<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.970> can

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the cats probably plugged but you can

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.120 
the cats probably plugged but you can
also<00:00:18.270> see<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.350> definitely<00:00:19.680> weakened<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
also see it was definitely weakened and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.320 
also see it was definitely weakened and
still<00:00:20.310> under<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.060> clean

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
still under one because it's clean

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
still under one because it's clean
there's<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.410> carbon<00:00:23.039> billet<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.550> not

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
there's a lot of carbon billet we're not

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.099 
there's a lot of carbon billet we're not
sure<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> gunk<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> there<00:00:25.019> if

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
sure what all that gunk is in there if

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.910 
sure what all that gunk is in there if
it's<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.350> carbon<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:28.470> oil<00:00:28.500> was

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it's just carbon or what the oil was

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.099 
it's just carbon or what the oil was
just<00:00:29.160> starting<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.670> milky<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.869> believe

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just starting to get milky we believe

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
just starting to get milky we believe
it's<00:00:31.260> been<00:00:31.410> using<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.859> slowly<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.059> while

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it's been using it slowly for a while

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
it's been using it slowly for a while
now<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.460> radiator<00:00:35.460> cap<00:00:35.700> was

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
now and that the radiator cap was

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.580 
now and that the radiator cap was
actually<00:00:36.270> bad<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.380> taken

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
actually bad because it was not taken

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
actually bad because it was not taken
out<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> coolant<00:00:38.370> tank<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.820> missing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
out of the coolant tank which is missing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
out of the coolant tank which is missing
we<00:00:39.360> took<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.250> radiator<00:00:41.610> was

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we took it out and the radiator was

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.900 
we took it out and the radiator was
pretty<00:00:42.239> empty

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
pretty empty

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.860 
pretty empty
so<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.000> believe<00:00:45.149> that's<00:00:45.390> what's<00:00:45.600> been

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
so we believe that's what's been

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
so we believe that's what's been
happening<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.910> there's<00:00:47.910> an<00:00:48.090> etch<00:00:48.270> on

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
happening with it there's an etch on

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.819 
happening with it there's an etch on
this<00:00:48.719> side<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> block<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this side of the block here that you

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.240 
this side of the block here that you
can't<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.770> patched<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
can't see and we kind of had patched it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.430 
can't see and we kind of had patched it
last<00:00:53.460> time<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.030> happened<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.020> that's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
last time this happened and it's that's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
last time this happened and it's that's
where<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> broke<00:00:55.860> again<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:58.010> we<00:00:59.010> went<00:00:59.730> down<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
where it broke again so we went down the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
where it broke again so we went down the
junkyard<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> morning<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> picked<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> two

gonna get once they pull it for us same
with<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> training<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.640> pull<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:11.909> trans

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bit it's got a hundred K on it and it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
bit it's got a hundred K on it and it
runs<00:01:20.490> great<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.270> too<00:01:21.420> bad<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> car<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.140> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
runs great it's too bad the car was in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
runs great it's too bad the car was in
there<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> didn't<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.180> use<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
there and that I didn't have use for a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.940 
there and that I didn't have use for a
good<00:01:24.750> Dodge<00:01:24.900> shadow<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.619> wasn't<00:01:25.860> much

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
good Dodge shadow because it wasn't much

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.550 
good Dodge shadow because it wasn't much
wrong<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.820> fact<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> needed<00:01:27.560> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
wrong with the fact that it needed you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.929 
wrong with the fact that it needed you
know<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.890> cleaned<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.700> had<00:01:29.820> put

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
know to be cleaned up and they had put

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.380 
know to be cleaned up and they had put
some<00:01:30.119> dents<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> yard<00:01:31.320> but

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
some dents in it down to the yard but

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.510 
some dents in it down to the yard but
you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.659> need<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> motor<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
you know we need a motor and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
you know we need a motor and
unfortunately<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.450> car<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.500> either

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
unfortunately for the car I was either

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.999 
unfortunately for the car I was either
gonna<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:38.009> crushed<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.610> motor<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.009> we

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.200 
gonna get crushed or motor or not so we
took<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> motor<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.610> tranny<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
took the motor and tranny out of it
