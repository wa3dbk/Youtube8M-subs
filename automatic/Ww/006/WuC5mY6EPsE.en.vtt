00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
extremely difficult to do a level 31 the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.299

biggest problem with it is just that at
level<00:00:50.489> 31<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.510> take<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.320> more

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
level 31 you just take so much more

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.790 
level 31 you just take so much more
damage<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> since<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> can't<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
damage and since you can't go in and you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560 
damage and since you can't go in and you
know<00:00:55.920> kill<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> mobs<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> could

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
know kill some of the mobs if you could

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.000 
know kill some of the mobs if you could
before<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.469> patched<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.359> it's<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:01.010> really

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
before they patched it it's just really

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
before they patched it it's just really
hard<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.270> damage<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hard and you take a lot of damage the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
hard and you take a lot of damage the
only<00:01:04.680> suggestions<00:01:05.309> i<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.729> make<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
only suggestions i can make is to have a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.710 
only suggestions i can make is to have a
good<00:01:09.020> maxed<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.140> fire<00:01:10.470> rocket<00:01:10.979> launcher<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
good maxed out fire rocket launcher I

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
good maxed out fire rocket launcher I
believe<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.380> need<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> Gallo<00:01:14.100> horn

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
believe you don't need the Gallo horn

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.539 
believe you don't need the Gallo horn
but<00:01:14.640> obviously<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> gal<00:01:15.270> horn<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:16.220> ideal<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
but obviously the gal horn is ideal I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
but obviously the gal horn is ideal I
think<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> could<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.420> done<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.710> hunger

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
think it could be done with the hunger

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.190 
think it could be done with the hunger
proto<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.750> dragons<00:01:22.350> breath<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
proto or with dragons breath or even I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.390 
proto or with dragons breath or even I
don't<00:01:25.200> remember<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.799> called<00:01:25.860> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.490 
to the right side and do the same thing
and<00:02:11.330> then<00:02:11.480> just<00:02:11.660> try<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.049> take<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.230> desk

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

singer<00:02:12.799> out<00:02:12.950> that's<00:02:13.670> really<00:02:14.420> all<00:02:14.690> there<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.930> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
singer out that's really all there is to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.420 
singer out that's really all there is to
it<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:16.400> just<00:02:16.580> hard<00:02:17.299> I<00:02:17.950> wish<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.250> was

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it and it's just hard I wish there was

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.580 
it and it's just hard I wish there was
something<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.239> could<00:02:20.390> do<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.569> some<00:02:20.959> more<00:02:21.170> tips<00:02:21.410> I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
something I could do or some more tips I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.220 
something I could do or some more tips I
can<00:02:21.620> give<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.250> do<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.810> mean<00:02:24.049> that's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
can give to do this but I mean that's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990 
can give to do this but I mean that's
pretty<00:02:24.440> much<00:02:24.620> all<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:24.890> need<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
pretty much all you need to do is just a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.120 
pretty much all you need to do is just a
bum<00:02:26.690> rush<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:26.989> Wizards<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> Shriekers

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
bum rush the Wizards on the Shriekers
and<00:02:28.370> just<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:28.849> whatever<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.299> can<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.569> keep

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and just do whatever you can to keep

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.020 
and just do whatever you can to keep
yourself<00:02:30.290> safe<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.920> take<00:02:31.370> as<00:02:31.519> little<00:02:31.640> damage

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
