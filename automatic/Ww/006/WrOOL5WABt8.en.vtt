00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.180
 hello today we see each time of vasco 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.820
 reds other great ballad of the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.690
 songwriter we see from the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.039
 agreements and then a nod on how 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.019
 accompany her with her right hand 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.119
 the song is in the major and part with 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.879
 the greater then I imagine this 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:01.239
 you will already know we can do it 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.769
 or with three fingers 123 with fingers 234 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.629
 leaving the index free is enough 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.439
 indifferent 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.950
 the subsequent agreement is a la 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.130
 major seven or in Italian we would say 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.440
 la7 more but regardless of the name it 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.740
 fingering can be complicated it is 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.479
 this is the rope to the is empty and mine 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.770
 big should not be touched I did not 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.530
 play then watch word 2 on 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.920
 re rope on the fourth string index finger 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.380
 on ford to soul third finger string 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.080
 annular on the ford has yes that is the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.060
 second string and I sing empty then 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.580
 the king is known by chance 7 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 as an agreement imagine 7 o'clock brought in 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.940
 I study the rope 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.870
 and so this is fine 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.930
 from the major we could also decide 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.830
 to hold the ring retainer on the handle 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.660
 reverse the position of the other two 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.660
 fingers and get this deal 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.060
 arrived here it is not difficult to remove 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.120
 the index move to our la7 like this 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.040
 I remove the index the soul crowd will result 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.240
 being empty I'll fight my third 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.950
 agreement 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 therefore the first three agreements are these 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.510
 well then it was passed in D major 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.510
 b I think no minor problem 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.879
 after which he returned to the major 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.250
 then there is a greater position 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.660
 standard 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.880
 and in the end on me major then 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.690
 add the pinky queen on the third 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.910
 chord key yes to get it mi7 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.270
 the agreement then the global profession 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.270
 this 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.260
 ok here to verify that the projection 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.090
 of agreements is right you will have to succeed in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.810
 hear this melody pass 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.810
 through agreements 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.760
 instead a kind of descending melody 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.140
 that on which they are really hinged 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.220
 all the various agreements do not start from 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:44.190
 this time up every agreement yes 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.750
 comes down a semitone agreed 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.840
 this is also the beauty of the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.670
 progression of this of this song 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.799
 moving to the accompanying part 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.569
 I still recommend you to use a picking 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.879
 as we have seen for the clear dawn 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.450
 open picking closed there with this 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.450
 accent here 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.560
 the app was born more open more decisive and one 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.040
 shorter tread given only on the notes 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.440
 low as we have seen this type of 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.940
 accompaniment really fits the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.310
 vast majority of songs 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.700
 so you have to do it because it solves you 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.320
 really a lot of problems in agreement 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.250
 as light music 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.990
 so let's see how it goes 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.040
 accompanied only four sequences of 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.040
 this kind for every agreement 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 la7 more 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.790
 la7 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.140
 reg 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.220
 re minor 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.070
 no 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.409
 me 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:06.430
 me 7 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:09.980
 ok as far as looking at the singing ok 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.080
 very high as usual in style 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.700
 red vasco vowel eventually you can 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.930
 think of singing it the eighth under 6 one 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.930
 practically a serious voice 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.330
 ok sorry if the words are not right 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.390
 here you train on this round of agreements 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.670
 very special and very beautiful e 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.750
 have fun with this great ballad of the 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.740
 emilian singer-songwriter 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.740
 Hello and see you soon
