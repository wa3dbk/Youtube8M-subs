00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
on the other side like that that's okay

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.309 
on the other side like that that's okay
I<00:02:11.370> start<00:02:12.239> off<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.780> but

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
I start off like that but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.270 
I start off like that but
I<00:02:13.379> put<00:02:14.129> my<00:02:14.249> pinky<00:02:14.810> down<00:02:15.810> under<00:02:16.230> anyways<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:17.249> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
I put my pinky down under anyways when I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.059 
I put my pinky down under anyways when I
do<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.620> suggest<00:02:19.620> starting<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
do that so I suggest starting in the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.809 
do that so I suggest starting in the
mechanic's<00:02:20.519> grip<00:02:21.379> okay<00:02:22.379> now<00:02:23.340> you're<00:02:23.579> going<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
mechanic's grip okay now you're going to

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.259 
mechanic's grip okay now you're going to
curl<00:02:24.150> up<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.450> thumb<00:02:24.959> ever<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.499> slightly<00:02:25.889> to

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
curl up your thumb ever so slightly to

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.089 
curl up your thumb ever so slightly to
let<00:02:27.269> about<00:02:27.959> half<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.469> packet<00:02:28.859> drop<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:30.750> half

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
let about half the packet drop just half

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.649 
let about half the packet drop just half
so<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.129> has<00:02:32.549> like<00:02:32.969> an<00:02:33.209> angle<00:02:33.599> here<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:36.180> curl

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
so it has like an angle here just curl

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.300 
so it has like an angle here just curl
up<00:02:36.719> your<00:02:36.870> thumb<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> little<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.769> let<00:02:38.069> the

up your thumb a little bit and let the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.360 
up your thumb a little bit and let the
packet<00:02:38.700> drop<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.709> you're<00:02:40.709> going<00:02:40.859> to<00:02:40.919> use<00:02:41.219> your

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
packet drop and you're going to use your

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.239 
packet drop and you're going to use your
index<00:02:41.730> finger<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.560> you're<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.739> push<00:02:44.040> it

index finger and you're going to push it

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.170 
index finger and you're going to push it
up<00:02:45.079> put<00:02:46.079> here<00:02:46.889> and<00:02:47.069> go<00:02:47.189> underneath<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.030> you're

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
up put here and go underneath and you're

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.509 
up put here and go underneath and you're
going<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.389> push<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:49.469> packet<00:02:49.889> up<00:02:50.069> with<00:02:50.370> your

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
index finger like that so if sort forms

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.300 
index finger like that so if sort forms
like<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.269> triangle<00:02:54.599> without<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.439> bottom<00:02:57.079> okay

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
like a triangle without the bottom okay

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.300 
like a triangle without the bottom okay
your<00:02:59.310> drop<00:02:59.810> use<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:00.959> index<00:03:01.230> finger<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.859> push

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it up like that all right and to finish

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
it up like that all right and to finish
it<00:03:07.739> off<00:03:07.919> when<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.359> you're<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
it off when you're here you're going to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.459 
it off when you're here you're going to
lift<00:03:10.290> your<00:03:10.699> thumb<00:03:11.699> and<00:03:11.969> this<00:03:12.659> packet<00:03:13.079> ever<00:03:13.260> so

lift your thumb and this packet ever so

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.789 
lift your thumb and this packet ever so
slightly<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:13.949> that<00:03:14.189> this<00:03:14.549> can<00:03:14.819> fall<00:03:15.060> under<00:03:15.389> and

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
slightly so that this can fall under and

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.339 
slightly so that this can fall under and
you're<00:03:16.799> going<00:03:16.949> to<00:03:17.010> clamp<00:03:17.219> it<00:03:17.430> together<00:03:18.349> okay

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
you're going to clamp it together okay

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.110 
you're going to clamp it together okay
and<00:03:21.109> if<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.319> easier<00:03:23.009> you<00:03:23.069> can<00:03:23.370> keep<00:03:24.000> your

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and if it's easier you can keep your

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.360 
and if it's easier you can keep your
index<00:03:24.509> finger<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.199> at<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:26.269> fold<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:28.370> just

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
index finger here at the fold and just

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.520 
index finger here at the fold and just
let<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.790> packet<00:03:30.359> rest<00:03:30.689> on<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:30.989> index

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
let this packet rest on your index

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.129 
let this packet rest on your index
finger<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.819> lower<00:03:33.180> your<00:03:33.329> index<00:03:33.810> finger

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
finger and just lower your index finger

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.960 
finger and just lower your index finger
and<00:03:34.489> clamp<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.609> together<00:03:36.049> okay<00:03:37.759> like<00:03:38.759> that

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
and clamp it together okay like that

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.869 
and clamp it together okay like that
it's<00:03:39.780> all<00:03:39.989> just<00:03:40.229> one<00:03:40.439> motion<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.639> can't

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
it's all just one motion you can't

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.929 
it's all just one motion you can't
really<00:03:42.030> think<00:03:42.509> about<00:03:42.659> it<00:03:42.840> much<00:03:43.729> once<00:03:44.729> you<00:03:44.819> get

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
really think about it much once you get

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.520 
really think about it much once you get
used<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.299> you'll<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.689> able<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.930> do<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.229> like

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
used to it you'll be able to do it like

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.229 
used to it you'll be able to do it like
twist<00:03:46.859> instinct<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:51.120> are<00:03:51.150> some

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
twist instinct and and here are some

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.289 
twist instinct and and here are some
little<00:03:51.629> tips<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:52.169> lot<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.189> times<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.879> had<00:03:54.180> this

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
little tips a lot of times I had this

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.349 
little tips a lot of times I had this
trouble<00:03:54.509> as<00:03:54.780> well<00:03:55.430> about<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.699> half<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> time

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
trouble as well about like half the time

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.229 
trouble as well about like half the time
you<00:03:57.540> do<00:03:57.719> it<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.709> will<00:03:58.889> be<00:03:59.069> very<00:03:59.099> hard<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.969> push

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
you do it it will be very hard to push

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.469 
you do it it will be very hard to push
up<00:04:00.479> and<00:04:00.949> it<00:04:01.949> will<00:04:02.099> Bend<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.790> packet<00:04:03.299> and

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
up and it will Bend this packet and

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.649 
up and it will Bend this packet and
that's<00:04:03.989> really<00:04:04.409> bad<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.799> your<00:04:04.889> cards<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.659> in

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
that's really bad for your cards and in

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.990 
that's really bad for your cards and in
all<00:04:07.379> of<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> videos<00:04:08.069> I've<00:04:08.340> seen<00:04:08.549> teaching

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
all of the videos I've seen teaching

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.629 
all of the videos I've seen teaching
this<00:04:09.120> cut<00:04:09.389> I've<00:04:09.629> never<00:04:09.930> heard<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.949> tip<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.489> I

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
this cut I've never heard this tip and I

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.749 
this cut I've never heard this tip and I
had<00:04:11.759> to<00:04:11.849> figure<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.180> all<00:04:12.389> by<00:04:12.539> myself<00:04:12.919> so<00:04:13.919> I'll

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
had to figure this all by myself so I'll

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.430 
had to figure this all by myself so I'll
make<00:04:14.969> it<00:04:15.090> easier<00:04:15.299> for<00:04:15.509> you<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.659> how<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.019> solve

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
make it easier for you to how to solve

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.499 
make it easier for you to how to solve
that<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:17.099> reason<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.789> happens<00:04:18.299> is

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
that the reason that that happens is

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.879 
that the reason that that happens is
that<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.349> bottom<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.549> deck<00:04:20.759> is<00:04:21.620> too<00:04:22.620> far

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
that the bottom of the deck is too far

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.760 
that the bottom of the deck is too far
down<00:04:22.949> on<00:04:23.669> your<00:04:23.849> fingers<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.650> there's<00:04:25.650> not

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
down on your fingers so there's not

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.629 
down on your fingers so there's not
enough

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
enough

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.450 
enough
