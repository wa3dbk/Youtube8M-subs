much you looking forward to that so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.069 
much you looking forward to that so
difficult<00:01:40.560> starts<00:01:41.100> 2012<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
difficult starts 2012 but you know you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.469 
difficult starts 2012 but you know you
played<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.530> against<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.070> feel<00:01:44.479> ya

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
played really well against about feel ya

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
played really well against about feel ya
think<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:47.509> we<00:01:48.509> play<00:01:48.720> very<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:49.979> play

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
think we we play very well when we play

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.789 
think we we play very well when we play
the<00:01:50.549> home<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.970> against<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:52.590> sure

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the home game against them and be sure

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.999 
the home game against them and be sure
we<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> compute<00:01:53.640> them<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:55.799> we

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
we can compute them and I think when we

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.870 
we can compute them and I think when we
if<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.670> review<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:58.200> performance<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
if we review the performance on the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.209 
if we review the performance on the
