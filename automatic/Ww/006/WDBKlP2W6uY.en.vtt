all the cosmoline off of it but we went

all the cosmoline off of it but we went
ahead<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.399> brought<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> rim

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
ahead and brought a little bit of rim

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
ahead and brought a little bit of rim
all<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.660> anyway<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> thing<00:00:44.129> cleaned

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
all out anyway to get this thing cleaned

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.529 
all out anyway to get this thing cleaned
up<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> more

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
up a little bit in some of the more

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.090 
up a little bit in some of the more
critical<00:00:45.750> areas<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
critical areas that are going to get a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
critical areas that are going to get a
little<00:00:47.340> friction<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> course<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little friction and of course this is a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.389 
little friction and of course this is a
brand<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.559> gun<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.950> there's<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
brand new gun so there's gonna be a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
brand new gun so there's gonna be a
tendency<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.000> need<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> break<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
tendency to need to break it in just a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
tendency to need to break it in just a
little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.680> anyway<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.789> went<00:00:54.000> ahead<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
little bit anyway so we went ahead and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
little bit anyway so we went ahead and
added<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.660> own<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:55.110> touch<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.649> rim<00:00:55.920> wall

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
added our own little touch of rim wall

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
added our own little touch of rim wall
on<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> still<00:00:58.260> kinda<00:00:58.559> had

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
on it as you can see it still kinda had

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.049 
on it as you can see it still kinda had
a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> noise<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> little

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
a little bit of noise to it a little

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
a little bit of noise to it a little
grind<00:01:00.480> 'no<00:01:00.690> stu<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> tighter

grind 'no stu it for the tighter

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.400 

we<00:02:04.119> took<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.420> weapon<00:02:04.720> down<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.080> cleaned<00:02:05.290> it

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
we took the weapon down and cleaned it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.410 
we took the weapon down and cleaned it
really<00:02:05.860> good<00:02:06.100> hoping<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:06.910> was<00:02:07.030> part<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.330> the

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
really good hoping that was part of the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.120 
really good hoping that was part of the
problem<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.350> thought<00:02:08.590> we'd<00:02:08.739> give<00:02:08.920> another

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
problem and we thought we'd give another

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:20.660 
problem and we thought we'd give another
magazine<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.640> shot<00:02:14.459> nope<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:17.290> happening

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.890 

everyone<00:02:21.670> has<00:02:21.880> their<00:02:22.030> own<00:02:22.060> theory<00:02:22.510> about<00:02:22.540> why

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
everyone has their own theory about why

everyone has their own theory about why
a<00:02:22.930> gun<00:02:23.230> doesn't<00:02:23.470> fire<00:02:23.620> properly<00:02:24.220> my<00:02:24.880> first

a gun doesn't fire properly my first

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.940 
a gun doesn't fire properly my first
thought<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.870> cheapest<00:02:26.260> alternative<00:02:26.410> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
thought and the cheapest alternative is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.600 
thought and the cheapest alternative is

in there to give it a shot first up was
the<00:02:42.820> monarch<00:02:43.299> since<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.690> was<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.049> closest<00:02:44.470> in

fine<00:03:32.140> let's<00:03:32.470> see<00:03:32.680> how<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.890> born<00:03:33.250> self-defense

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
fine let's see how the born self-defense

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.410 
fine let's see how the born self-defense
rounds<00:03:34.390> worked<00:03:37.830> another<00:03:38.830> day<00:03:39.130> at<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.280> office

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
however when we shot the self-defense

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.710 
however when we shot the self-defense
rounds<00:04:20.799> we<00:04:21.640> had<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.789> hundred<00:04:22.120> percent<00:04:22.330> success

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
rounds we had a hundred percent success

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960 
rounds we had a hundred percent success
with<00:04:23.410> running<00:04:23.830> both<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.430> these<00:04:24.550> rounds

with running both of these rounds

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.659 
with running both of these rounds
through<00:04:25.150> there<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.810> what<00:04:25.960> was<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.260> difference

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
through there so what was the difference

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.130 
through there so what was the difference
now<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.729> most<00:04:27.970> obvious<00:04:28.120> difference<00:04:28.539> is<00:04:29.050> the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
now the most obvious difference is the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.469 
now the most obvious difference is the
shape<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.650> tip<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> bullet<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479
