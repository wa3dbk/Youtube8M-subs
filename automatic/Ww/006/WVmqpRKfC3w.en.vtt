at that
this<00:05:33.610> happens<00:05:33.939> every<00:05:34.059> fucking<00:05:34.539> time<00:05:34.569> the<00:05:35.289> only

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
this happens every fucking time the only

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.320 
this happens every fucking time the only
way<00:05:35.559> I<00:05:35.709> could<00:05:35.889> actually<00:05:36.249> beat<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:37.089> is

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
way I could actually beat that is

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.829 
way I could actually beat that is
getting<00:05:37.779> extremely<00:05:38.229> lucky<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.009> having

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
getting extremely lucky and having

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:48.359 
getting extremely lucky and having
jagger<00:05:40.839> Rieger<00:05:42.509> shits<00:05:43.509> really<00:05:43.809> loud<00:05:47.219> the<00:05:48.219> only

jagger Rieger shits really loud the only

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:49.799 
jagger Rieger shits really loud the only
way<00:05:48.489> I<00:05:48.519> could<00:05:48.639> beat<00:05:48.879> it<00:05:48.909> is<00:05:49.119> if<00:05:49.330> Jagger

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:49.809 
way I could beat it is if Jagger

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:56.659 
way I could beat it is if Jagger
completely<00:05:50.679> misses<00:05:51.069> holy<00:05:52.029> shit<00:05:52.360> that's<00:05:52.449> loud

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.429 

so<00:05:57.669> yeah<00:05:58.269> if<00:05:58.389> he<00:05:58.569> misses<00:05:58.779> like<00:05:59.079> all<00:05:59.259> his

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
so yeah if he misses like all his

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.249 
so yeah if he misses like all his
attacks<00:05:59.829> then<00:06:00.179> Jagger<00:06:01.179> misses<00:06:01.569> all<00:06:01.719> is<00:06:01.809> a<00:06:01.839> text

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
attacks then Jagger misses all is a text

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.100
