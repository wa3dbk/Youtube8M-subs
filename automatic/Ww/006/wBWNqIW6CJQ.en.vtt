00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.080
 This is a conventional communications room composed of a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.199
 switch 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.209
 switch and other telecommunications systems powered by a 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.580
 contact which in turn is interconnected by a load centers 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 traditional systems 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.359
 in a traditional system copper rods are installed to land the racc 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.470
 and others for the load center 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.580
 so these metals dissipate electrical discharges so the subsoil 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 the main disadvantage of these systems and directional and is that you can 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 induce the energy emitted by microwave signals 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 and radiofrequency located in the earth's crust 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.730
 creating a pension 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.900
 come inti erra up to 40 or 60 bags 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.080
 When lightning strikes the current goes to the subsoil and can be induced reaching the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 load center 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 to the contact and finally to the team 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.850
 for kaos solves these problems with its grounding system a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.450
 directional 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.320
 The farah cabos system consists of an electrode and a magneto device 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.420
 assets that guarantee less than two points of resistance 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.220
 Its installation is carried out underground by orienting one of the edges of the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 electropop towards the north pole leveling 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.560
 later the pit is filled with layers of earth of the place and composed 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 organic 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.349
 the domain of cathodic polarity is achieved by creating a virtual mesh of 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.300
 80 meters of radius to demonstrate when measuring busway continuity to a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.789
 ground reference element 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:24.979
 95% of the atmospheric discharges are catholic to the being for channel 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:30.259
 cathodic polarity we avoid by equal charges the attraction of the discharge in 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.179
 this area 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.659
 if any current tries to induce sep they find second element of the 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.379
 system 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.549
 completed 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.739
 that when a current circulates it returns it to earth based on the law of slogans and 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.049
 transforming it into heat in this way the electrical network and the integrity of 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.139
 equipment remains always protected 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.939
 for kaos 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.939
 the solution to problems of energy quality 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.749
 technology 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:00.779
 of the new cycle
