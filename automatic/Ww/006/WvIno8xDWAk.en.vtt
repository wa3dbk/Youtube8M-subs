tested the pcs plus I ninety to ninety
from<00:01:06.119> power<00:01:06.330> color<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.810> thought<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> was

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
from power color I thought it was

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
from power color I thought it was
absolutely<00:01:07.590> excellent<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> I've

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
absolutely excellent and I've

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
absolutely excellent and I've
interesting<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> retest<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.640> if

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
interesting to retest it now and see if

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
interesting to retest it now and see if
it<00:01:11.880> still<00:01:12.150> holds<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.950> like

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

number one or two spot that I've always
said<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> held<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.299> actually

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

is the best on i-29 you can get or if

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the vapor X can actually beat it but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.480

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.710 
driver CD a 6 pin to eight pin adapter
and<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:04.970> not<00:02:05.970> very<00:02:06.000> much<00:02:06.330> exists

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and that's it so not very much exists

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.400 
and that's it so not very much exists
reason<00:02:07.080> here<00:02:08.210> but<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.360> don't<00:02:09.540> buy<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.960> for<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
reason here but you don't buy it for the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
reason here but you don't buy it for the
accessories<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.430> ok

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
accessories so that's ok

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.290 
accessories so that's ok

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
more of a a big rundown of the specs

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.370 
more of a a big rundown of the specs
between<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.209> vapor<00:02:30.209> X<00:02:30.420> when<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> do

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
between this and the vapor X when I do

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.470 
between this and the vapor X when I do
that<00:02:31.680> video<00:02:31.970> let's<00:02:32.970> give<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> general<00:02:33.690> idea

that video let's give you a general idea

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.199 
that video let's give you a general idea
this<00:02:36.480> thing<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.230> as<00:02:37.530> huge<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.730> remember

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
this thing is just as huge as I remember

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.210 
this thing is just as huge as I remember
it<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.200> massive<00:02:42.590> my<00:02:43.590> goodness<00:02:44.100> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
it is just so massive my goodness this

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.900 
it is just so massive my goodness this
is<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> big<00:02:44.700> graphics<00:02:45.270> card<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:47.610> memory<00:02:47.880> on

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
is a big graphics card so the memory on

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.120 
is a big graphics card so the memory on
this<00:02:48.120> bad<00:02:48.360> boy<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.930> running<00:02:49.200> at<00:02:50.570> 5400

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
this bad boy is running at 5400

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.100 
this bad boy is running at 5400
gigabytes<00:02:53.130> per<00:02:53.220> second

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
gigabytes per second

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.840 
gigabytes per second
that'll<00:02:55.110> be<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.410> contrast<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.160> vapor<00:02:56.340> extras

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
that'll be in contrast the vapor extras

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.500 
that'll be in contrast the vapor extras
at<00:02:57.000> 5.6<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:58.170> believe<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.120> got<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> cool

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
at 5.6 I believe and it's got a cool

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.090 
at 5.6 I believe and it's got a cool
clock<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.050> thousand<00:03:01.530> 40<00:03:01.980> megahertz<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:04.110> so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
clock of a thousand 40 megahertz so so

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.320 
clock of a thousand 40 megahertz so so
I've<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.340> some<00:03:05.489> pretty<00:03:05.670> good<00:03:05.760> specs<00:03:06.060> now<00:03:06.269> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I've got some pretty good specs now the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.770 
I've got some pretty good specs now the
color<00:03:06.660> obviously<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.519> very<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:09.269> big<00:03:09.540> deal

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
color obviously is a very very big deal

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.590 
color obviously is a very very big deal
with<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.260> guy<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.370> has<00:03:11.580> what<00:03:12.360> looks<00:03:12.390> like

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
with this guy so it has what looks like

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.740 
with this guy so it has what looks like
five<00:03:13.080> heat<00:03:13.380> pipes<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.769> believe<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:15.180> looks<00:03:15.420> like

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
five heat pipes I believe it looks like

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.820 
five heat pipes I believe it looks like
this<00:03:16.049> five<00:03:16.500> yes<00:03:17.450> yes<00:03:18.450> total<00:03:18.810> five<00:03:19.290> heat<00:03:19.560> pipes

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
a pure copper base oh so did she

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.370 
a pure copper base oh so did she
upgraded<00:03:28.140> components<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:30.480> all<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.110> just

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
upgraded components and all that just

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.530 
upgraded components and all that just
like<00:03:31.530> most<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.130> top<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.610> my<00:03:32.850> line<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.209> 90s

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
like most of the top on my line to 90s

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.470 
like most of the top on my line to 90s
do<00:03:34.430> around<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> front<00:03:35.820> no<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.390> just

video I just did this one because I knew
you<00:03:56.430> guys<00:03:56.580> would<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.570> just

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
you guys would like to see it and just

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.420 
you guys would like to see it and just
to<00:03:57.840> show<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.019> guys<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.920> am<00:03:59.190> actually

getting<00:03:59.760> around<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.269> doing<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:01.200> this

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
getting around to doing it see this

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.240 
getting around to doing it see this
thing<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.680> huge<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.459> probably<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.989> as

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
thing is huge it's probably just as

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.910 
thing is huge it's probably just as
long<00:04:04.460> or<00:04:04.810> maybe<00:04:05.810> slightly<00:04:06.050> longer<00:04:06.590> than<00:04:06.770> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
long or maybe slightly longer than the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.680 
long or maybe slightly longer than the
vapor-x<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.670> already<00:04:07.850> tell<00:04:08.120> already<00:04:08.270> that's

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
vapor-x and already tell already that's

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.730 
vapor-x and already tell already that's
a<00:04:08.870> lot<00:04:09.080> thicker

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
a lot thicker

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.680 
a lot thicker
well<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.220> vapor-x<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:10.820> pretty<00:04:11.000> big<00:04:11.240> car<00:04:11.450> too

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
well the vapor-x is a pretty big car too

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.230 
well the vapor-x is a pretty big car too
so<00:04:11.930> both<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.140> these<00:04:12.350> are<00:04:12.410> pretty<00:04:13.220> massive<00:04:13.550> but

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
so both of these are pretty massive but

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.940 
so both of these are pretty massive but
we<00:04:14.300> should<00:04:14.510> see<00:04:14.750> some<00:04:14.990> awesome<00:04:15.470> performance

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
we should see some awesome performance

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.470 
we should see some awesome performance
coming<00:04:16.250> out<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.820> some<00:04:17.269> awesome

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
coming out of this and some awesome

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.210 
coming out of this and some awesome
performance<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.230> normal<00:04:18.560> coming<00:04:18.859> out<00:04:18.980> of

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
performance like normal coming out of

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.020 
performance like normal coming out of
the<00:04:19.370> vapor<00:04:19.670> X<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.470> now<00:04:21.650> two<00:04:22.220> predictions<00:04:22.790> this

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
the vapor X so now two predictions this

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.700 
the vapor X so now two predictions this
is<00:04:23.150> where<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.420> guys<00:04:23.570> come<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
is where you guys come in so in the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.310 
is where you guys come in so in the
comments<00:04:25.250> below<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.730> want<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.510> guys<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.750> tell

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
comments below I want you guys to tell

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.080 
comments below I want you guys to tell
me<00:04:27.530> what<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.580> going<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.790> come<00:04:28.970> out

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
me what you think is going to come out

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.560 
me what you think is going to come out
on<00:04:29.360> top<00:04:29.600> from<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.650> information<00:04:31.190> I've<00:04:31.310> given

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
on top from the information I've given

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.300 
on top from the information I've given
basically<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.840> just<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.830> give<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.010> guys<00:04:34.070> an

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
basically the just to give you guys an

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.570 
basically the just to give you guys an
idea<00:04:34.370> off<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.150> back<00:04:35.360> is<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:36.620> power<00:04:37.040> color<00:04:37.340> has

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
idea off the back is the power color has

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.820 
idea off the back is the power color has
a<00:04:37.610> slightly<00:04:38.240> higher<00:04:38.720> core<00:04:39.110> clock<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.530> believe

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
a slightly higher core clock I believe

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.040 
a slightly higher core clock I believe
by<00:04:40.070> very<00:04:40.730> little<00:04:40.970> with<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.390> guess<00:04:41.600> about<00:04:41.840> ten

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
by very little with I guess about ten

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.080 
by very little with I guess about ten
megahertz<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:42.860> I'd<00:04:43.010> have<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.730> go<00:04:43.880> through

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
megahertz I think I'd have to go through

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.530 
megahertz I think I'd have to go through
it<00:04:44.210> again<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:45.770> do<00:04:45.890> so<00:04:46.070> many<00:04:46.330> graphics<00:04:47.330> card

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
it again I just do so many graphics card

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.820 
it again I just do so many graphics card
videos<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:47.990> hard<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.320> remember<00:04:48.530> all<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
videos it's hard to remember all the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.730 
videos it's hard to remember all the
numbers<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.750> vapor<00:04:51.080> eggs<00:04:51.320> I<00:04:51.410> know<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.710> a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
numbers but the vapor eggs I know for a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.280 
numbers but the vapor eggs I know for a
fact<00:04:51.980> has<00:04:52.250> faster<00:04:53.180> memory<00:04:53.390> speed<00:04:53.780> than<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
fact has faster memory speed than the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.650 
fact has faster memory speed than the
power<00:04:54.530> color<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.430> leave<00:04:55.970> your<00:04:56.060> predictions<00:04:56.570> in

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
power color so leave your predictions in

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.060 
power color so leave your predictions in
the<00:04:56.720> comments<00:04:56.930> below<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.470> what<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.890> actually

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
the comments below and what you actually

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.860 
the comments below and what you actually
think<00:04:58.250> it's<00:04:58.669> going<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.030> win<00:04:59.270> out<00:04:59.390> of<00:04:59.419> these<00:04:59.630> and

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
think it's going to win out of these and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.510 
think it's going to win out of these and
also<00:05:00.470> leave<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:00.980> comments<00:05:01.310> what<00:05:01.400> you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
also leave in the comments what you

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.010 
also leave in the comments what you
think's<00:05:01.820> going<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.030> win<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.390> temperatures

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
think's going to win in temperatures

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.440 
think's going to win in temperatures
because<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:04.040> sit<00:05:04.520> before<00:05:04.700> that<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.240> power

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
because I sit before that the power

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.140 
because I sit before that the power
color<00:05:05.690> pcs<00:05:06.110> plus<00:05:06.380> was<00:05:06.650> excellent<00:05:07.550> cooler<00:05:07.910> on

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
color pcs plus was excellent cooler on

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.520 
color pcs plus was excellent cooler on
it<00:05:08.300> which<00:05:08.479> is<00:05:08.510> true<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.930> mean<00:05:09.140> this<00:05:09.290> thing<00:05:09.500> is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
it which is true I mean this thing is

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.450 
it which is true I mean this thing is
just<00:05:09.830> enormous

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
just enormous

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520 
just enormous
but<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.910> vapor<00:05:11.300> X<00:05:11.479> is<00:05:11.690> no<00:05:11.840> slouch<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.380> that's

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
but that vapor X is no slouch and that's

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.290 
but that vapor X is no slouch and that's
a<00:05:12.650> big<00:05:12.919> car<00:05:13.190> too<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.790> has<00:05:13.880> their<00:05:14.030> vapor

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
a big car too and it has their vapor

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.300 
a big car too and it has their vapor
chamber<00:05:14.690> technology<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.620> other<00:05:15.830> things<00:05:16.100> like

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
chamber technology and other things like

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.280 
chamber technology and other things like
that<00:05:16.370> now<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.090> believe<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.540> fans<00:05:17.840> are<00:05:18.050> slightly

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
that now I believe the fans are slightly

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.590 
that now I believe the fans are slightly
larger<00:05:18.860> on<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.130> vapor<00:05:19.640> X<00:05:19.910> but<00:05:20.210> we'll<00:05:20.330> get<00:05:20.510> to

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
larger on the vapor X but we'll get to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.840 
larger on the vapor X but we'll get to
that<00:05:20.630> in<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.900> full<00:05:21.110> beer<00:05:21.610> anyways<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.790> think

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
that in the full beer anyways I think

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.370 
that in the full beer anyways I think
you<00:05:23.180> guys<00:05:23.240> watching<00:05:23.630> this<00:05:23.690> B<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:23.930> think<00:05:24.320> you

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
you guys watching this B I think you

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.450 
you guys watching this B I think you
guys<00:05:24.470> for<00:05:24.620> sticking<00:05:24.770> around<00:05:24.950> me<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.370> we're

guys for sticking around me and we're
finally<00:05:25.729> going<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.060> finish<00:05:26.300> off<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:27.260> nine

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
finally going to finish off the a nine

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710 
finally going to finish off the a nine
to<00:05:27.770> ninety<00:05:28.010> series<00:05:28.340> with<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.550> big<00:05:28.760> send-off<00:05:29.210> the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
to ninety series with a big send-off the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.900 
to ninety series with a big send-off the
king<00:05:30.200> who's<00:05:30.470> going<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.800> be<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.160> top<00:05:31.460> number

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
king who's going to be the top number

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.870 
king who's going to be the top number
one<00:05:32.710> already<00:05:33.710> if<00:05:34.010> you're<00:05:34.160> asking<00:05:34.520> what's<00:05:34.760> the

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
one already if you're asking what's the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.550 
one already if you're asking what's the
number<00:05:35.210> three<00:05:35.510> I'd<00:05:35.750> say<00:05:35.990> I'd<00:05:36.169> probably<00:05:36.350> have

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
number three I'd say I'd probably have

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.130 
number three I'd say I'd probably have
to<00:05:36.620> solidly<00:05:37.430> give<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.880> number<00:05:38.150> three<00:05:38.479> spot<00:05:38.660> to

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
to solidly give the number three spot to

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.030 
to solidly give the number three spot to
the<00:05:39.380> Sapphire<00:05:40.130> tracks<00:05:41.320> just<00:05:42.320> because<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.800> its

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
the Sapphire tracks just because of its

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.969 
the Sapphire tracks just because of its
cooling<00:05:43.460> efficiency<00:05:44.050> its<00:05:45.050> speed<00:05:45.470> odorous

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
cooling efficiency its speed odorous

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.580 
cooling efficiency its speed odorous
boys<00:05:46.250> did<00:05:46.580> quite<00:05:46.820> well<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.390> its<00:05:47.930> price<00:05:48.229> it<00:05:48.500> was

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
boys did quite well and its price it was

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.740 
boys did quite well and its price it was
always<00:05:48.800> very<00:05:49.040> good<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:49.820> I'd<00:05:50.270> say<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.630> number

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
always very good so I'd say the number

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.710 
always very good so I'd say the number
three<00:05:51.169> spot<00:05:51.350> in<00:05:52.160> my<00:05:52.370> opinion<00:05:52.790> goes<00:05:53.090> to<00:05:53.390> the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
three spot in my opinion goes to the

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.140 
three spot in my opinion goes to the
Sapphire<00:05:54.320> tracks<00:05:54.919> although<00:05:55.370> some<00:05:55.640> say<00:05:55.880> maybe

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
Sapphire tracks although some say maybe

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.180 
Sapphire tracks although some say maybe
the<00:05:56.450> gigabyte<00:05:56.960> wind<00:05:57.229> force<00:05:57.530> deserves<00:05:57.979> the

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
the gigabyte wind force deserves the

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.219 
the gigabyte wind force deserves the
number<00:05:58.430> three<00:05:58.669> spot<00:05:58.820> but<00:05:59.419> personally<00:05:59.780> I<00:05:59.840> put

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
number three spot but personally I put

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.370 
number three spot but personally I put
that<00:06:00.320> in<00:06:00.500> number<00:06:00.620> four<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:02.330> so<00:06:02.690> that's<00:06:02.900> with
