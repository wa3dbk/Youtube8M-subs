on my makeup in the two drawers of this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
on my makeup in the two drawers of this
desk<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.110> IKEA<00:00:37.530> um<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.340> comes<00:00:38.460> in

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
desk that I got at IKEA um it comes in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.040 
desk that I got at IKEA um it comes in
two<00:00:38.790> colors<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> white<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.840> wood

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
two colors this is the white with wood

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.750 
two colors this is the white with wood
drawers<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> believe<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> comes<00:00:41.550> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
drawers and then I believe it comes in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
drawers and then I believe it comes in
black<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.360> white<00:00:42.629> drawers<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.770> only

black with white drawers and it was only

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490 
black with white drawers and it was only
$99<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.090> reasonable<00:00:45.629> had<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
$99 so it's really reasonable had it for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.959 
$99 so it's really reasonable had it for
a<00:00:46.559> couple<00:00:46.590> years<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.399> liked<00:00:47.579> it
