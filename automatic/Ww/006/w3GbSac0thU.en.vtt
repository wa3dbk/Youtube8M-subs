00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
stoked on these bushings and the reason

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.730 
stoked on these bushings and the reason
why<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.779> with<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.289> set<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
why is because with just one set of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310 
why is because with just one set of
bushings<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.670> get<00:00:26.820> either<00:00:27.000> soft<00:00:27.510> medium

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
bushings you can get either soft medium

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.209 
bushings you can get either soft medium
or<00:00:28.769> hard<00:00:29.369> tension<00:00:29.939> yeah<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.859> set<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
or hard tension yeah just one set of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.450 
or hard tension yeah just one set of
bushings<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.989> mainly<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
bushings and these are mainly because of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
bushings and these are mainly because of
its<00:00:35.610> unique<00:00:36.090> design<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> get

its unique design which I'm going to get

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
its unique design which I'm going to get
into<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.450> but<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> just

bushings look like now they aren't clear
and<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:12.720> medium<00:01:13.650> type<00:01:14.159> material

from<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> bushing<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
from the bushing well that's because of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.320 
from the bushing well that's because of
their<00:01:23.820> unique<00:01:24.299> design<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
their unique design and the way that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
their unique design and the way that
they<00:01:27.479> are<00:01:27.509> designed<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.439> bottom<00:01:29.340> piece<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
they are designed the bottom piece that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
they are designed the bottom piece that
i<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.479> right<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.680> bigger

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
i have on here right now is the bigger

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.819 
i have on here right now is the bigger
bushing<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> shaped<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
bushing and it's kind of shaped like it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.899 
bushing and it's kind of shaped like it
has<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.220> mushroom<00:01:35.490> cap<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.909> then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
has like a mushroom cap on it and then

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
has like a mushroom cap on it and then
the<00:01:39.210> smaller<00:01:39.540> bushing<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.619> i<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the smaller bushing which i have on the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.389 
the smaller bushing which i have on the
top<00:01:41.490> underneath<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> kingpin<00:01:42.630> nut<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.399> kind

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
top underneath the kingpin nut is kind

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.010 
top underneath the kingpin nut is kind
of<00:01:44.490> shaped<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.149> guess<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.689> best<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
of shaped like I guess the best way to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280 
of shaped like I guess the best way to
describe<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> half<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.130> bullet<00:01:48.290> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
describe it would be half a bullet now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340 
describe it would be half a bullet now
with<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:50.040> unique<00:01:50.729> designs<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.659> all<00:01:51.869> depends

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
with these unique designs it all depends

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.469 
with these unique designs it all depends
on<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.100> use<00:01:53.310> them<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.210> whatever

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
on how you use them to get whatever

tension that you want to get out of them

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.660 
tension that you want to get out of them
right<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> haven't<00:01:57.810> set<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.979> media

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
right now I haven't set up for the media

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
right now I haven't set up for the media
attention<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.040> pretty<00:02:02.369> much

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
attention which is which is pretty much

the<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.049> my<00:02:04.200> bushings<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.829> got

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the way that I like my bushings it's got

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.660 
the way that I like my bushings it's got
a<00:02:05.009> nice<00:02:06.290> turning<00:02:07.290> radius<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> feels

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
a nice turning radius to it and it feels

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
a nice turning radius to it and it feels
really<00:02:08.849> comfortable<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.110> my

preference so that's the beauty of both

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.380 
preference so that's the beauty of both
these<00:02:12.390> bushings

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
these bushings

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.740 
these bushings
they<00:02:13.870> will<00:02:13.990> pretty<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:15.750> satisfy

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
going to tell you how to set it up for

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
going to tell you how to set it up for
soft<00:02:21.550> tension<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.450> soft<00:02:22.720> tension<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.319> you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
soft tension for soft tension what you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.690 
soft tension for soft tension what you
would<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.890> would<00:02:24.010> put<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.459> bigger

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
would do is you would put the bigger

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.170 
would do is you would put the bigger
bushing<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.680> top<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> mushroom<00:02:27.940> cap

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
bushing on top with the mushroom cap

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.770 
bushing on top with the mushroom cap
facing<00:02:28.780> facing<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.980> kingpin<00:02:30.550> net<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.000> then

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
facing facing the kingpin net and then

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.720 
facing facing the kingpin net and then
the<00:02:31.959> bullet<00:02:32.380> or<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.890> half<00:02:33.070> bullet<00:02:33.459> would<00:02:33.610> be

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the bullet or the half bullet would be

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.820 
the bullet or the half bullet would be
on<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> bottom<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.320> that's<00:02:35.530> how<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.740> would

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
on the bottom so that's how you would

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.160 
on the bottom so that's how you would
set<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.520> soft<00:02:36.760> tension<00:02:37.209> which<00:02:37.540> for

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
set it up for the soft tension which for

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.380 
set it up for the soft tension which for
me<00:02:38.320> was<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.560> little<00:02:38.920> too<00:02:39.190> soft<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:40.360> little

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
me was a little too soft and a little

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.990 
me was a little too soft and a little
too<00:02:40.780> loose<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.739> hey<00:02:41.980> some<00:02:42.340> people<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.819> that

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
too loose but hey some people like that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.820 
too loose but hey some people like that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
going to love these and the way that I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.930 
going to love these and the way that I
have<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.709> set<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:47.920> right<00:02:48.160> now<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.340> medium

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
have it set up right now for medium

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.440 
have it set up right now for medium
tension<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.630> with<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.590> mushroom<00:02:51.489> cap<00:02:51.760> bushing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
tension is with the mushroom cap bushing

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.690 
tension is with the mushroom cap bushing
on<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.959> bottom<00:02:53.380> with<00:02:54.070> obviously<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
on the bottom with obviously the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
mushroom cap facing down and then the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.070 
mushroom cap facing down and then the
bullet<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.820> sitting<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:58.360> top<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:58.989> you

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
bullet is sitting on top and then you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.110 
bullet is sitting on top and then you
just<00:02:59.320> put<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.190> kingpin<00:03:00.640> net<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.000> that's

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
just put on the kingpin net and that's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.000 
just put on the kingpin net and that's
how<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.330> get<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.230> medium<00:03:02.530> tension<00:03:02.769> out

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
how you get the the medium tension out

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.670 
how you get the the medium tension out
of<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> heart<00:03:05.019> tension<00:03:05.530> is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
of it and to get the heart tension is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.910 
of it and to get the heart tension is
pretty<00:03:06.010> much<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.489> same<00:03:06.880> setup<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.870> medium<00:03:08.320> but

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
pretty much the same setup as medium but

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.310 
pretty much the same setup as medium but
you<00:03:09.040> just<00:03:09.220> put<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> washer<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.630> top<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.050> all

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
you just put a washer on the top and all

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.830 
you just put a washer on the top and all
the<00:03:11.440> bushings<00:03:11.650> do<00:03:12.550> come<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.570> set<00:03:13.780> of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
the bushings do come with a set of

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.680 
the bushings do come with a set of
washers<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.590> each<00:03:15.489> pack<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:16.510> their

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
washers in each pack and that's their

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.229 
washers in each pack and that's their
little<00:03:16.900> packaging<00:03:17.709> right<00:03:17.799> there<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.209> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
little packaging right there there is a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.729 
little packaging right there there is a
second<00:03:19.720> washer<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.079> there<00:03:20.200> there<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.410> go<00:03:20.530> just

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
second washer in there there you go just

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.699 
second washer in there there you go just
fell<00:03:20.920> down<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.959> yeah<00:03:23.110> that's<00:03:23.260> how<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.530> would

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
fell down so yeah that's how you would

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.590 
fell down so yeah that's how you would
get<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.400> heart<00:03:24.640> tension<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.420> just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
get the heart tension out of it is just

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.479 
get the heart tension out of it is just
by<00:03:25.720> placing<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.140> washer<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:26.980> tried<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
by placing the washer on and I tried the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.539 
by placing the washer on and I tried the
heart<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.910> tension<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:28.870> well<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.489> that

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
heart of tension as well it's not that

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.509 
heart of tension as well it's not that
it<00:03:30.790> was<00:03:30.940> crazy<00:03:31.900> hard<00:03:32.410> because<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.920> wasn't<00:03:33.340> it

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
it was crazy hard because it wasn't it

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.210 
it was crazy hard because it wasn't it
just<00:03:34.120> wasn't<00:03:34.510> mom<00:03:34.750> my<00:03:35.350> preference<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.010> mean

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
just wasn't mom my preference I mean

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.240 
just wasn't mom my preference I mean
even<00:03:36.519> though<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.269> was<00:03:37.600> at<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.079> hard<00:03:38.350> tension

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
even though it was at the hard tension

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.009 
even though it was at the hard tension
setting<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:40.239> still<00:03:40.480> had<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> pretty<00:03:40.870> good

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
setting you still had a pretty good

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.250 
setting you still had a pretty good
turning<00:03:41.799> radius<00:03:42.190> um<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:43.810> was<00:03:43.930> still<00:03:44.140> pretty

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
turning radius um it was still pretty

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.440 
turning radius um it was still pretty
comfortable<00:03:44.709> turning<00:03:44.980> whatnot<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:46.000> just

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
comfortable turning whatnot but I just

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.630 
comfortable turning whatnot but I just
out<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.930> all<00:03:47.170> three<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.560> preferred<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.160> medium

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
out of all three I preferred the medium

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.220 
out of all three I preferred the medium
now<00:03:49.060> there's<00:03:49.239> some<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.049> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
now there's some of you that like to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.310 
now there's some of you that like to
have<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.680> loose<00:03:51.480> tension<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.630> your<00:03:52.840> front<00:03:53.049> truck

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
have a loose tension on your front truck

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.560 
have a loose tension on your front truck
and<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.590> hard<00:03:53.799> tension<00:03:54.100> on<00:03:54.190> your<00:03:54.220> back<00:03:54.459> or<00:03:54.700> vice

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
and a hard tension on your back or vice

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.300 
and a hard tension on your back or vice
versa<00:03:55.870> well<00:03:56.560> that's<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.860> thing<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.130> these

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
versa well that's the thing with these

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.190 
versa well that's the thing with these
bushings<00:03:57.730> with<00:03:58.000> these<00:03:58.150> bushings<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.720> can<00:03:58.959> do

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
bushings with these bushings you can do

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.009 
bushings with these bushings you can do
all<00:03:59.500> kinds<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.850> combinations<00:04:01.060> any<00:04:01.750> type<00:04:01.989> of

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
all kinds of combinations any type of

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.630 
all kinds of combinations any type of
combination<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.829> want<00:04:03.040> really<00:04:03.280> and

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
combination that you want really and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.930 
combination that you want really and
that's<00:04:04.299> what<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.480> found<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.670> awesome<00:04:06.670> about

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
that's what I found so awesome about

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.590 
that's what I found so awesome about
these<00:04:07.360> bushings<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:09.370> having<00:04:09.760> said<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:10.060> as

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
these bushings now having said that as

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440 
these bushings now having said that as
great<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.769> these<00:04:11.950> bushings<00:04:12.400> are<00:04:12.670> there<00:04:13.150> was

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
great as these bushings are there was

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.069 
great as these bushings are there was
one<00:04:14.340> thing<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.820> was<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.950> little

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
one thing that was a little

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.570 
one thing that was a little
disappointing<00:04:20.079> or<00:04:20.410> actually<00:04:21.370> little

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
disappointing or actually little

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.380 
disappointing or actually little
frustrating<00:04:22.270> was<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:24.070> hole<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.729> the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
frustrating was the the hole in the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.620 
frustrating was the the hole in the
middle<00:04:25.599> of<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.930> bushing

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
middle of the bushing

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.250 
middle of the bushing
to<00:04:26.780> be<00:04:27.020> able<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.290> put<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.250> kingpin<00:04:29.260> was

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
to be able to put it on the kingpin was

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.760 
to be able to put it on the kingpin was
really<00:04:31.040> really<00:04:31.640> tight<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.360> was<00:04:32.770> very

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
really really tight so it was very

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.950 
really really tight so it was very
difficult<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.670> get<00:04:34.880> these<00:04:35.060> bushings<00:04:35.480> on<00:04:35.750> at

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
difficult to get these bushings on at

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.070 
difficult to get these bushings on at
first<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.590> with<00:04:37.520> them<00:04:37.730> being<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.300> small<00:04:38.690> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
first and with them being so small and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.300 
first and with them being so small and
clear<00:04:39.790> um<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.990> actually<00:04:41.990> almost<00:04:42.500> dropped<00:04:43.070> one

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
clear um I actually almost dropped one

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.420 
clear um I actually almost dropped one
of<00:04:43.400> them<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:45.080> first<00:04:45.920> thing<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.190> thought<00:04:46.370> of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
of them and I first thing I thought of

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.340 
of them and I first thing I thought of
was<00:04:46.700> if<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.120> dropped<00:04:47.510> these<00:04:47.720> bushings<00:04:48.140> on<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
was if I dropped these bushings on the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.170 
was if I dropped these bushings on the
floor<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:48.980> had<00:04:49.100> rolled<00:04:49.430> somewhere<00:04:49.910> I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
floor if they had rolled somewhere I

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.550 
floor if they had rolled somewhere I
would<00:04:50.420> have<00:04:50.480> never<00:04:50.720> found<00:04:50.990> them<00:04:51.260> because

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
would have never found them because

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.620 
would have never found them because
they're<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:51.920> small<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.580> clear<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.510> they're

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
they're so small and clear so they're

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.340 
they're so small and clear so they're
hard<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.930> see<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.400> my<00:04:55.550> recommendation<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:56.360> to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
hard to see so my recommendation to to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.490 
hard to see so my recommendation to to
know<00:04:57.530> logo<00:04:58.040> would<00:04:58.460> be<00:04:58.610> just<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.000> make<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.500> the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
know logo would be just to make the the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.830 
know logo would be just to make the the
hole<00:05:00.770> in<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.130> center<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.670> bushings<00:05:02.180> wider

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
hole in the center of the bushings wider

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.440 
hole in the center of the bushings wider
so<00:05:03.260> it's<00:05:03.410> easier<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:04.400> slide<00:05:04.640> on<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.150> off<00:05:05.240> of

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
so it's easier to slide on and off of

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.650 
so it's easier to slide on and off of
the<00:05:05.540> kingpin<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.700> think<00:05:07.700> by<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:07.940> third<00:05:08.330> time

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
the kingpin I think by the third time

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.140 
the kingpin I think by the third time
that<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.590> took<00:05:09.830> them<00:05:10.130> off<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.490> on<00:05:10.670> because<00:05:10.970> I

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
that I took them off and on because I

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.910 
that I took them off and on because I
tried<00:05:11.360> all<00:05:11.540> three<00:05:11.690> different<00:05:12.050> tensions<00:05:12.440> it

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
tried all three different tensions it

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.280 
tried all three different tensions it
was<00:05:13.070> getting<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.400> little<00:05:13.520> easier<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.300> put<00:05:15.050> on

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
was getting a little easier to put on

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.030 
was getting a little easier to put on
and<00:05:15.560> off<00:05:15.650> but<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:17.780> initial<00:05:18.080> time<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:18.980> you

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
and off but the initial time that you

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.970 
and off but the initial time that you
put<00:05:19.220> them<00:05:19.370> on<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.670> very<00:05:20.450> difficult<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.320> my

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
put them on is very difficult and my

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.470 
put them on is very difficult and my
recommendation<00:05:22.640> if<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:22.970> get<00:05:23.090> these<00:05:23.180> adjust

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
recommendation if you get these adjust

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.420 
recommendation if you get these adjust
be<00:05:23.750> careful<00:05:24.230> take<00:05:24.590> your<00:05:24.710> time<00:05:24.920> and<00:05:24.950> patience

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
be careful take your time and patience

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.160 
be careful take your time and patience
putting<00:05:25.730> these<00:05:25.820> on<00:05:26.060> because<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.930> don't<00:05:27.110> want

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
putting these on because you don't want

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.020 
putting these on because you don't want
them<00:05:27.380> dropping<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.130> falling<00:05:28.820> on<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.000> ground

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
them dropping and falling on the ground

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.090 
them dropping and falling on the ground
or<00:05:29.480> your<00:05:29.720> if<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.020> carpet<00:05:30.500> it'll<00:05:30.950> be

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
or your if you have carpet it'll be

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.940 
or your if you have carpet it'll be
almost<00:05:31.430> next<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.120> impossible<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.780> find<00:05:33.020> but

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
almost next to impossible to find but

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.080 
almost next to impossible to find but
yeah<00:05:34.360> aside<00:05:35.360> from<00:05:35.540> that<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:36.110> bushings<00:05:36.560> are

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
yeah aside from that the bushings are

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.080 
yeah aside from that the bushings are
fantastic<00:05:38.090> again<00:05:38.840> they<00:05:39.080> have<00:05:39.230> a<00:05:39.260> great

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
fantastic again they have a great

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.140 
fantastic again they have a great
comfortable<00:05:41.680> steering<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.890> turning<00:05:43.520> radius

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
comfortable steering and turning radius
