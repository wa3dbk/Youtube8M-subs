00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
and if timing is off so Rick reham is

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.310 
and if timing is off so Rick reham is
really<00:02:57.030> smart<00:02:57.299> at<00:02:57.510> putting<00:02:57.900> things<00:02:57.989> where

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
really smart at putting things where

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.190 
really smart at putting things where
they<00:02:58.500> need<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.890> as<00:02:59.519> far<00:02:59.820> as<00:03:00.000> using<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
they need to be as far as using the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.979 
they need to be as far as using the
spacing<00:03:01.620> game<00:03:01.769> against<00:03:02.310> Sonics<00:03:03.120> box<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.570> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
spacing game against Sonics box and it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.240 
spacing game against Sonics box and it
looks<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.500> are<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.829> gonna<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.220> a

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
looks like we are not gonna have a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.449 
looks like we are not gonna have a
character<00:03:05.850> change<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> guess<00:03:08.250> these

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
character change here so I guess these

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.110 
character change here so I guess these
guys<00:03:08.519> are<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.090> gonna<00:03:09.239> go<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.790> nice<00:03:11.790> mix

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
guys are just gonna go for it nice mix

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.759 
guys are just gonna go for it nice mix
up<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.450> recreant<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.079> go<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.410> critical

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
up for recreant to go for the critical

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.080 
up for recreant to go for the critical
bars<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.130> thought<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.459> critical<00:03:14.790> verse<00:03:14.910> was

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
bars I thought the critical verse was

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.119 
bars I thought the critical verse was
coming<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> he<00:03:16.049> opted<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.650> throw
