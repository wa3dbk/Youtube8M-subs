00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.390 
then I figure detangled away before I
put<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.420> foam<00:03:03.660> head<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> can

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
put it on the foam head so that I can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.150 
put it on the foam head so that I can
have<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.660> straight<00:03:07.110> as<00:03:07.230> possible<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.430 
have it as straight as possible and I
also<00:03:08.370> wanted<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.820> try<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.510> flat<00:03:09.960> as<00:03:10.230> possible

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.830 

this<00:03:36.409> is<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.709> wig<00:03:36.920> after<00:03:37.670> allowing<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.390> dry

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
this is the wig after allowing it to dry

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.220 
this is the wig after allowing it to dry
for<00:03:39.319> 24<00:03:39.920> hours<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:41.000> was<00:03:41.239> actually<00:03:41.750> dropping

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
for 24 hours it was actually dropping

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.399 
for 24 hours it was actually dropping
for<00:03:42.439> 24<00:03:42.950> hours<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:43.969> I<00:03:44.239> did<00:03:44.599> allow<00:03:44.900> an<00:03:45.109> extra

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
for 24 hours but I did allow an extra

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.319 
for 24 hours but I did allow an extra
time<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.890> dry<00:03:47.409> on<00:03:48.409> average<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.489> wig<00:03:49.700> may<00:03:49.970> take

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
time to dry on average the wig may take

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.270 
time to dry on average the wig may take
about<00:03:50.930> 12<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:52.099> 15<00:03:52.519> hours<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.939> dry<00:03:53.180> also<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.980> can

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
about 12 to 15 hours to dry also you can

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.050 
about 12 to 15 hours to dry also you can
put<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.819> fan<00:03:56.120> across<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.810> way<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.000> can

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
put a fan across the way so that you can

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.270 
put a fan across the way so that you can
dry<00:03:59.329> faster<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.989> don't<00:04:00.170> recommend<00:04:00.470> go<00:04:00.709> giant
