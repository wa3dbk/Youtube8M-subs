00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
in seed on there as well it's coming

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.719 
in seed on there as well it's coming
through<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.099> don't<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.310> how<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.640> going

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
through it I don't know how it's going

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.699 
through it I don't know how it's going
to<00:02:08.819> show<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> camera<00:02:09.599> there<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to show up on the camera there but you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.400 
to show up on the camera there but you
can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> had<00:02:12.660> none<00:02:12.870> these<00:02:13.080> were

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can see so I had none these were

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
can see so I had none these were
all<00:02:13.470> bare<00:02:13.710> rocks<00:02:14.100> they<00:02:14.670> didn't<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.150> any<00:02:15.360> on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
all bare rocks they didn't have any on

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.590 
all bare rocks they didn't have any on
them<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:18.210> see<00:02:18.390> lots<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.810> growing<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.260> there

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
them and see lots of it growing on there

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.050 
them and see lots of it growing on there
I<00:02:21.600> did<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.290> an<00:02:22.440> algae<00:02:22.920> bloom<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
I did get an algae bloom it was a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
I did get an algae bloom it was a
problem<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.690> went<00:02:24.870> away<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.290> weekend<00:02:25.770> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
problem I went away for the weekend and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.630 
problem I went away for the weekend and
I<00:02:26.880> had<00:02:27.330> someone<00:02:27.600> watching<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.080> tank<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
I had someone watching the tank and I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.970 
I had someone watching the tank and I
totally<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.870> were<00:02:30.960> leaving<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.440> forgot<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
totally when we were leaving I forgot to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.830 
totally when we were leaving I forgot to
come<00:02:32.160> back<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.820> shut<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.090> daylight<00:02:33.570> off

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
come back in and shut the daylight off

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.420 
come back in and shut the daylight off
and<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.520> stayed<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.450> like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and so it stayed on for like

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.450 
and so it stayed on for like
40-something<00:02:38.430> hours<00:02:38.880> anyway<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.220> tank

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
40-something hours anyway and the tank

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.830 
40-something hours anyway and the tank
was<00:02:41.900> fucking<00:02:42.900> horrible<00:02:43.080> when<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.590> got<00:02:43.740> back

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
was fucking horrible when I got back

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.150 
was fucking horrible when I got back
there's<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:45.990> no<00:02:46.170> better<00:02:46.350> way<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> say<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
there's really no better way to say it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.210 
there's really no better way to say it
was<00:02:47.610> red<00:02:48.210> algae<00:02:48.620> everywhere<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.830> complete

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
was red algae everywhere the complete

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.070 
was red algae everywhere the complete
bottom<00:02:50.640> was<00:02:50.850> almost<00:02:51.240> like<00:02:51.450> red<00:02:51.660> grass<00:02:53.960> so<00:02:54.960> I've

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
bottom was almost like red grass so I've

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.720 
bottom was almost like red grass so I've
been<00:02:55.170> working<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.620> cleaning<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.190> out<00:02:56.220> doing

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
been working on cleaning that out doing

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.310 
been working on cleaning that out doing
some<00:02:56.880> water<00:02:57.090> changes<00:02:57.540> interestingly<00:02:57.930> enough

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
some water changes interestingly enough

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.160 
some water changes interestingly enough
though<00:02:58.680> my<00:02:58.860> levels<00:02:59.280> did<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.670> spike<00:03:00.060> they<00:03:00.990> all

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
though my levels did not spike they all

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.100 
though my levels did not spike they all
stayed<00:03:01.530> pretty<00:03:01.860> good<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.690> was<00:03:03.810> happy<00:03:04.080> about

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
stayed pretty good so I was happy about

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.310 
stayed pretty good so I was happy about
that<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> that's<00:03:06.390> where<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:06.780> there's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
that so that's where we are now there's

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.310 
that so that's where we are now there's
some<00:03:07.530> more<00:03:07.560> little<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:09.090> ntid's<00:03:09.540> there's<00:03:10.170> not

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
some more little so ntid's there's not

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.260 
some more little so ntid's there's not
really<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.620> way<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.800> zoom<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.520> don't<00:03:11.580> think<00:03:11.820> on

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
really a way to zoom in I don't think on

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.080 
really a way to zoom in I don't think on
the<00:03:12.480> iPhone

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
the iPhone

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.740 
the iPhone
let's<00:03:15.090> trying<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:17.190> doesn't<00:03:17.520> really

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
let's trying but it doesn't really

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.610 
let's trying but it doesn't really
anyway<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> don't<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.350> see<00:03:19.500> them

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
anyway I don't know if you can see them

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.220 
anyway I don't know if you can see them
they're<00:03:19.770> orange<00:03:20.130> hair<00:03:20.370> flame<00:03:20.990> change<00:03:21.990> the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
lighting you can see everything's

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.540 
lighting you can see everything's
