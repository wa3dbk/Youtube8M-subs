we're actually in the process of making
this<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.960> cool<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.649> something

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this so it was cool it's not something

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.069 
this so it was cool it's not something
that<00:00:35.160> you're<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.550> find<00:00:36.059> anywhere<00:00:36.780> very

coming<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> trying<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.219> every<00:00:41.940> single

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
coming out and trying it every single

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
coming out and trying it every single
year<00:00:42.360> between<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> third<00:00:43.230> week<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> September

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
year between the third week of September

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
year between the third week of September
and<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> second<00:00:44.730> week<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> October<00:00:45.090> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and the second week of October it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
and the second week of October it's
crushing<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:47.879> winemakers

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
crushing time that's when winemakers

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
crushing time that's when winemakers
have<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> decide<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> pick<00:00:50.039> their<00:00:50.250> grapes

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
have to decide when to pick their grapes

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.670 
have to decide when to pick their grapes
and<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.480> important<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.230> grape<00:00:52.410> stomp

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and it's important for the grape stomp

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040 
and it's important for the grape stomp
to<00:00:52.860> occur<00:00:53.250> before<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.879> first<00:00:54.300> freeze<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to occur before the first freeze of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770 
to occur before the first freeze of the
season<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> break<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> berry<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.539> want

season want to break the berry we want
to<00:00:57.870> separate<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.710> broken<00:00:59.190> berry<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
to separate that broken berry from the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720 
to separate that broken berry from the
stem<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> grape<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.829> must<00:01:02.309> or

the the juice the the pulp and the skins

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.020 
the the juice the the pulp and the skins
we<00:01:07.200> ferment<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:09.299> ten<00:01:09.930> days<00:01:09.960> this

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
we ferment and in about ten days this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
we ferment and in about ten days this
this<00:01:12.030> wine<00:01:12.420> must<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.619> grape<00:01:14.010> juice

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this wine must will be grape juice

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550 
this wine must will be grape juice
fermented<00:01:15.060> grape<00:01:15.240> juice<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.780> we'll<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
fermented grape juice and we'll put it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.820 
fermented grape juice and we'll put it
in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> barrel<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.490> we'll<00:01:18.450> let<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.659> age<00:01:19.080> for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in the barrel and we'll let it age for

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
in the barrel and we'll let it age for
about<00:01:20.040> two<00:01:20.580> years<00:01:20.610> probably<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
about two years probably out of this

while you're in the early stages of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
while you're in the early stages of
straight<00:01:31.560> rushing<00:01:32.009> when<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.460> step<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> them

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
straight rushing when you step on them

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.800 
straight rushing when you step on them
they<00:01:33.210> pop<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:35.970> experience

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they pop so it's it's an experience

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 
they pop so it's it's an experience
people<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.500> stomping<00:01:37.979> quick<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
people are like stomping quick but you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
people are like stomping quick but you
want<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.270> stomp<00:01:39.540> slower<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
want it stomp slower because then you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
want it stomp slower because then you
can<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.890> feel<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.310> squishing<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.210> was
