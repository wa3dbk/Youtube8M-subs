 Neil Patrick Harris Set Itself It's Tasty 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.450
 there is familiar humor from the set 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.190
 so big doesn't even melt wonder how 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.690

 jokes vulgarly my rude or too 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.950

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.030
 justice and suicidal babes can 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.989
 see in our group a reference below 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.989
 Welcome 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.350
 all exhaled advertising ended let's 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 move on to serious and today i'm not 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.970
 I will tell some universes to him 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.180
 or even about something that directly concerns 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.270
 it is the emma market that I will most likely touch upon 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 the outline of the general theme namely the recent 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.030
 events in Moscow at school where 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.920
 I remind the student took and killed shot 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.959
 your geography teacher 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.980
 and then he shot the cop then 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.500
 took another hostage of his 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 classmates kept them until the arrival of his father 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.880
 who managed to persuade 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.470
 teenager surrender but speak i will 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.600
 not even about this tragic event 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.090
 definitely a tragic event i will 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.250
 talk about inadequate response to this 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 the event of the authorities namely that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.930
 The State Duma was submitted a draft bill on 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.769
 tightening up for it im products namely 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.019
 behind the games 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.870
 I do not quite understand what a moron and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.180
 mentally retarded idiot need to be 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 to link these two events apparently 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.440
 our deputies believed false information 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 provided in the media the first time when 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.610
 those on stopping were shouting that boy 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.489
 they say gamers were huge 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.900
 the amount of time spent with games and 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.380
 cruel games most important krovischa 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.600
 boobs sex abuse drugs and because 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.299
 that he went to school and did what 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.380
 he certainly made sure that those 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.950
 same media 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.450
 blackened a completely different guy 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.120
 namesake and the same name and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.430
 persistently argued that it was him 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
 here's a photo of the face of the same media 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.350
 you can certainly trust yes definitely 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.019
 the problem lies on the surface I will say one thing 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.890
 my position is tough never 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.260
 will change no film is not one game is not 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.269
 one series no theater 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.000
 staging what would be cruel and what 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.610
 dirty gone and filled with sex and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 debauchery never could 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.250
 change teen or child none 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.829
 teenager no child after playing 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.650
 some cruel game like vlog 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.380
 will not kill because this game 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.209
 it does not directly affect the psyche 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.190
 surely can be a catalyst 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.820
 but actually like any event in 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.039
 child's life 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.440
 and guilty almost always guilty 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.060
 parents and entourage let's take a look at 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480
 specific situation in Moscow 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.760
 the child came with his father's wheel 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.280
 a loaded gun I am not an expert but of course 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.100
 usually the bullets keep the side of the gun 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.080
 in general sometimes in another place it means 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.240
 that the guy knew where the gun is that it 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.639
 he could easily reach him he knew 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.770
 where are the cartridges he took them calmly 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.080
 out of the house not only many apparently 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.510
 it is no idea that just take a gun and 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.060
 shooting a person is not so easy 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.790
 psychologically not in any way 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.260
 case is corny physical you of course 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.570
 in games definitely 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.790
 hellish nagibatory and generally packs and 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.460
 kill everyone headshots from a distance of 3 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.450
 5 kilometers but in life it's different and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.520
 in order to use 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.120
 firearms need some 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.280
 skills 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.600
 which means this guy had skills I didn't 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.150
 I dare say that my point of view 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.790
 only right but so it tells me 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.560
 reason logic and critical reasoning 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.840
 what happened must be sought in the family 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.330
 and then climb anywhere but 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.270
 it's always easier to make a name for yourself 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.460
 on what happened why not throw out 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.140
 another cool bill because 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.450
 which then begin to have problems 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.890
 completely different people all the more 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.130
 guys in russia anyway all this crap 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.320
 with ratings up to sixteen 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.330
 until eighteen does not work so can 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.400
 let's be done to work 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.830
 in this case, our deputies nod at 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.510
 West say here look there are entered 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.990
 ratings and everything is fine nobody 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.880
 rebels 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.770
 let 's face it firstly 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.080
 rating there were carried on with television 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.970
 starting from the middle of the century that is this 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.080
 long practice so she is now 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.729
 working in television she 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.500
 the games really work for them 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.700
 do not work very well piracy in 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.190
 states not much not much 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.470
 common but still quite strong and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.090
 toys swing safely from everyones 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.100
 torrent trackers so ratings there 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.410
 they don't help much but they have it 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.360
 happened over the years and you want it 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.070
 Immediately we worked here yes no it 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.500
 another attempt to make a name for yourself 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.970
 tragic event on the mountain of people plus 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.530
 everything is likely to drink later 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.360
 a small budget and maybe a big one 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.830
 budget for some absolutely unnecessary 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.570
 crap style let's ban everything 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.789
 toys all this on pilitsii will settle in 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.190
 pockets of certain officials all 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.010
 just no i'm not waving red 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.140
 flag and do not call all 5 on the Maidan 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.400
 no, when I see a huge amount 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.040
 Adults like was 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.630
 smart experienced people like sheep nod 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.080
 when ems tv screens 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.210
 TVs are broadcast and the games are not harmful 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.280
 allow your children tatya volskaya 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.130
 better machines let them believe in god 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.229
 of ours and so on as if it becomes me 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.970
 disgusting sad for our people 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.110
 of the limited thinking of our people 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.360
 but nothing can be done 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.880
 most likely you did not expect to hear it 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.350
 in the next podcast but write to 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.479
 comments what do you think about this 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.270
 and how do we get out of this situation 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.100
 what does it do to prevent such a thing 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.990
 god did not happen and maybe 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.340
 really worth tightening up access to 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.080
 games though on the other hand 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.610
 but for some it is the only one 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.919
 opportunity for example to look at 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.810
 boobs and well for today all next time
