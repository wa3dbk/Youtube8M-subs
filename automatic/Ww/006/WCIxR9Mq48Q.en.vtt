00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.870 
I've never won a belt in my entire life
I've<00:01:48.869> used<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.320> salva<00:01:49.829> maneuver<00:01:50.250> I've<00:01:50.700> also

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I've used about salva maneuver I've also

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
I've used about salva maneuver I've also
done<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.450> oblique<00:01:51.990> work<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
done a lot of oblique work because I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
done a lot of oblique work because I
feel<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.579> important<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.509> able<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
feel that it's important to be able to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
feel that it's important to be able to
rotate<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> full<00:01:56.549> ranges<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> motion<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
rotate to the full ranges of motion the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
rotate to the full ranges of motion the

human body is a three dimensional system
and<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> must<00:01:59.880> train<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and you must train in a way that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
and you must train in a way that
integrates<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.130> normal<00:02:02.460> movement<00:02:02.640> path

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that your abs will get both now can you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
that your abs will get both now can you
minimize<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.670> effects<00:02:09.149> yes<00:02:09.720> even<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.319> you're

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
minimize the effects yes even if you're

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.830 
minimize the effects yes even if you're
doing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
doing

to<00:02:12.910> explain<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.540> ways<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> can

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
to explain to you ways that you can

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.830 
to explain to you ways that you can

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
possibly modify this effect of bulking

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.650 
possibly modify this effect of bulking
number<00:02:17.440> one<00:02:17.650> I'd<00:02:17.950> pull<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.330> end<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.569> your

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
number one I'd pull this the end of your

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.050 
number one I'd pull this the end of your
routine<00:02:20.500> by<00:02:21.190> doing<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> pole<00:02:21.640> overs<00:02:21.910> it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
routine by doing the pole overs it's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.910 
routine by doing the pole overs it's
gonna<00:02:22.150> give<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> more<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.260> vacuum<00:02:23.830> effect

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
gonna give you more that vacuum effect

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.190 
gonna give you more that vacuum effect
it's<00:02:24.459> gonna<00:02:24.640> suck<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.690> saw<00:02:25.840> my<00:02:25.990> video

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's gonna suck you in you saw my video

on how to get a vacuum you know that I

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.090 
on how to get a vacuum you know that I
talk<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> lot<00:02:28.330> about<00:02:28.360> pullovers<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.590> they<00:02:29.739> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
talk a lot about pullovers why they is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bring abs and a bit it's going to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.470 
bring abs and a bit it's going to
prevent<00:02:33.459> them<00:02:33.610> from<00:02:33.670> sticking<00:02:33.910> out<00:02:34.209> from<00:02:34.360> the
