another problem that needs addressing

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
another problem that needs addressing
but<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.840> another<00:01:39.870> time<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:41.370> may

but that's for another time you may

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
but that's for another time you may
notice<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.510> are<00:01:42.630> no<00:01:42.750> opponents

shooting back at me well that's because

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.280 
shooting back at me well that's because
there<00:01:47.010> aren't<00:01:47.280> any<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:47.880> against<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.510> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
CTE you limit your numbers even more

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.130 
CTE you limit your numbers even more

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
because it's on PC and the PC numbers

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
because it's on PC and the PC numbers
are<00:01:55.260> low<00:01:55.440> anyway<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.850> need<00:01:57.000> premium

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
are low anyway and then you need premium

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.080 
are low anyway and then you need premium
to<00:01:57.659> access<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> CTE<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.010> you're<00:01:59.610> limiting

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
to access the CTE so you're limiting

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
to access the CTE so you're limiting
your<00:02:00.180> numbers<00:02:00.540> down<00:02:00.720> even<00:02:01.500> further<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.520> we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
your numbers down even further so we

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
your numbers down even further so we
need<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> figure<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.210> ways<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.680> get

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
need to figure out ways also to get

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.550 
need to figure out ways also to get
players<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> CTE<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.630> right<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.900> how

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
players on the CTE because right now how

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
players on the CTE because right now how
can<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.830> test<00:02:08.189> improvement<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.909> the<00:02:08.939> game<00:02:09.299> if

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
can you test improvement on the game if

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.429 
can you test improvement on the game if
nobody<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:12.000> test<00:02:12.299> them<00:02:12.569> my

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
nobody is there to actually test them my

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.250 
nobody is there to actually test them my
first<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.250> most<00:02:14.430> logical<00:02:15.000> idea<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.569> will<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
first and most logical idea is will you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.080 
first and most logical idea is will you
open<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.860> non<00:02:17.160> premium<00:02:17.459> members

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
open it up to non premium members

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.580 
open it up to non premium members
straight<00:02:18.510> away<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.349> have<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.040> you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
straight away you have to if you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.350 
straight away you have to if you
going<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:20.950> improving<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.670> game<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.120> need

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
going to be improving the game you need

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440 
going to be improving the game you need
numbers<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.349> CTE<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.819> bottom<00:02:25.269> line

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
numbers on the CTE that is bottom line

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.960 
numbers on the CTE that is bottom line
you<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.379> numbers<00:02:26.860> I've<00:02:27.700> got<00:02:27.940> a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
you have to have numbers I've got a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.390 
you have to have numbers I've got a
couple<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.300> ideas<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.900> my<00:02:29.019> own<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.200> how<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.830> think

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
couple of ideas of my own on how I think

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
couple of ideas of my own on how I think
we<00:02:30.489> can<00:02:30.640> improve<00:02:30.910> hard<00:02:31.269> line<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:31.660> PC<00:02:32.080> members

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
we can improve hard line for PC members

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.070 
we can improve hard line for PC members
and<00:02:32.620> bear<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.190> mind<00:02:33.220> please<00:02:33.870> people<00:02:34.870> say

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
and bear this in mind please people say

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.500 
and bear this in mind please people say
the<00:02:35.260> game<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.650> failure<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.849> game<00:02:37.180> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the game is a failure the game is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.759 
the game is a failure the game is
actually<00:02:37.930> doing<00:02:38.650> well<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.690> consoles<00:02:40.690> okay<00:02:41.620> on

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
actually doing well on consoles okay on

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.910 
actually doing well on consoles okay on
next-gen<00:02:42.640> consoles<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.629> doing<00:02:44.349> really<00:02:44.379> well

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
next-gen consoles it's doing really well

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.750 
next-gen consoles it's doing really well
better<00:02:45.580> than<00:02:45.910> they<00:02:46.120> expected<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.049> fact

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
better than they expected in fact

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.369 
better than they expected in fact
unfortunately<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:50.019> low<00:02:50.349> on

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
unfortunately it's just really low on

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.100 
unfortunately it's just really low on
the<00:02:50.709> pc<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.370> there<00:02:52.090> has<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.599> reason<00:02:52.840> for

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
the pc and there has to be a reason for

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.350 
the pc and there has to be a reason for
that<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.440> mean<00:02:53.739> console<00:02:54.250> players<00:02:54.459> do<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
that I mean console players do like the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.870 
that I mean console players do like the
game<00:02:55.510> right<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.860> game<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.310> console

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
game right now is the game to console

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.259 
game right now is the game to console
friendly<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:59.650> know<00:02:59.860> but<00:03:00.819> we<00:03:01.000> need<00:03:01.030> to

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
friendly I don't know but we need to
