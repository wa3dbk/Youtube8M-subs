you my friend
now<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.730> we've<00:02:32.850> spawned<00:02:32.970> behind<00:02:33.360> me<00:02:33.510> we're

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
now that we've spawned behind me we're

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
going on a tear I think we should get

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.400 
going on a tear I think we should get
these<00:02:35.190> dogs<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.840> doing<00:02:36.840> decent<00:02:37.140> look<00:02:37.230> at<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.380> a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
these dogs in doing decent look at the a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.560 
these dogs in doing decent look at the a
da<00:02:37.620> emblem<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.880> doesn't<00:02:39.210> look<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.450> good

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
da emblem it doesn't look as good

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.730 
da emblem it doesn't look as good
unfortunately<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.230> doesn't<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.590> it's

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
unfortunately as it doesn't like it's

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
unfortunately as it doesn't like it's
too<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.130> wasn't<00:02:41.370> quite<00:02:41.460> as<00:02:41.610> much

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
too because it wasn't quite as much

in<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:51.020> they're<00:02:52.020> building<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:52.800> we<00:02:52.890> go<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
in the they're building a there we go I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.080 
in the they're building a there we go I
think<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> last<00:02:53.430> guy<00:02:53.670> was<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.910> there

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
think that's the last guy was in there

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
think that's the last guy was in there
so<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.300> good<00:02:54.620> shrine<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.770> now<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.040> call

to control the recoil this is one of the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.940 
to control the recoil this is one of the
best<00:03:07.890> think<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.730> probably<00:03:09.500> best<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:10.770> black
