00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
are just jealous because these

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
are just jealous because these

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
individuals are out there living the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
life that we wish we were living and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
life that we wish we were living and
we're<00:00:48.329> stuck<00:00:48.809> working<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> stuff

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we're stuck working and all this stuff

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.139 
we're stuck working and all this stuff
but<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.079> dispense<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
but I think if we dispense with all that

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.950 
but I think if we dispense with all that
the<00:00:54.149> fact<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.899> working<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:56.960> really

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the fact that we are working is really

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.650 
the fact that we are working is really
more<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> common<00:00:59.219> thread<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.629> I

Google and Adsense and YouTube is going
to<00:06:06.370> keep<00:06:06.580> on<00:06:06.730> trucking<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.240> way<00:06:07.360> it's<00:06:07.540> been<00:06:07.750> I

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
to keep on trucking the way it's been I

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.290 
to keep on trucking the way it's been I
think<00:06:08.950> even<00:06:09.160> if<00:06:09.280> someone<00:06:09.640> did<00:06:09.820> make<00:06:10.030> enough

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
think even if someone did make enough

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.710 
think even if someone did make enough
money<00:06:10.510> to<00:06:10.870> count<00:06:11.230> on<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.710> support<00:06:11.920> them<00:06:12.720> who

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
money to count on to support them who

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.150 
money to count on to support them who
knows<00:06:13.900> how<00:06:14.080> many<00:06:14.140> days<00:06:14.470> are<00:06:14.680> left<00:06:14.860> there's

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
knows how many days are left there's

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.920 
knows how many days are left there's
gonna<00:06:15.340> be<00:06:15.580> like<00:06:15.790> that<00:06:16.000> but<00:06:16.360> I<00:06:16.420> think<00:06:16.540> through

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
gonna be like that but I think through

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.320 
gonna be like that but I think through
monetization<00:06:17.650> that<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.010> a<00:06:18.040> way<00:06:18.280> that<00:06:18.580> you<00:06:19.150> can

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
monetization that is a way that you can

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.060 
monetization that is a way that you can
get<00:06:19.450> some<00:06:19.690> compensation<00:06:20.470> for<00:06:20.680> the<00:06:20.740> time<00:06:20.920> you

spend making videos and that's a way

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.140 
spend making videos and that's a way
