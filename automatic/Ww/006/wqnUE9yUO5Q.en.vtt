was 15 but you know I slowed down a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.920 
was 15 but you know I slowed down a
little<00:01:18.909> bit<00:01:19.090> because<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.479> was<00:01:19.600> at<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.780> point

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
little bit because I was at the point

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.140 
little bit because I was at the point
guard<00:01:20.260> position<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:21.340> now<00:01:21.549> I<00:01:21.580> play<00:01:21.850> putting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
guard position and now I play putting

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.550 
guard position and now I play putting
guards<00:01:22.390> so<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.540> really<00:01:22.750> can<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.140> know<00:01:23.260> score

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560
