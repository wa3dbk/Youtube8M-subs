some<00:01:02.510> water<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.990> then<00:01:03.230> allowed<00:01:03.560> to<00:01:03.860> start<00:01:04.309> to

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
some water and then allowed to start to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.920 
some water and then allowed to start to
germinate<00:01:04.939> that's<00:01:05.299> when<00:01:05.600> they're<00:01:05.750> most

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
germinate that's when they're most

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.720 
germinate that's when they're most
bioavailable<00:01:06.350> for<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.010> body<00:01:07.190> how<00:01:07.400> would<00:01:07.580> I

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
bioavailable for the body how would I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.970 
bioavailable for the body how would I
know<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:08.600> almond<00:01:09.170> has<00:01:09.350> germinated

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
know that this almond has germinated

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.410 
know that this almond has germinated
because<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.610> doesn't<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.000> any<00:01:11.150> little

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
because it doesn't have any little

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
because it doesn't have any little
tendrils<00:01:11.840> on<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.350> i<00:01:12.409> mean<00:01:12.530> i<00:01:12.620> would<00:01:12.740> expect

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
tendrils on it i mean i would expect

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.380 
tendrils on it i mean i would expect
that<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.340> would<00:01:13.460> know<00:01:13.730> do<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.060> see<00:01:14.240> this

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
that it would know do you see this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.720 
that it would know do you see this
little<00:01:14.450> top<00:01:14.990> here<00:01:15.500> yeah<00:01:16.130> that's<00:01:16.370> where<00:01:16.610> it

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
little top here yeah that's where it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.210 
little top here yeah that's where it
starts<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.450> little<00:01:17.720> nub<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.800> little<00:01:19.100> nub

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
starts this little nub that little nub

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.370 
starts this little nub that little nub
little<00:01:20.090> nub<00:01:20.300> that's<00:01:20.780> where<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.229> they've

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
little nub that's where it's so they've

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.960 
little nub that's where it's so they've
just<00:01:21.560> begun<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:22.070> spank<00:01:22.340> just<00:01:22.550> begun<00:01:22.790> and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
just begun to spank just begun and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.370 
just begun to spank just begun and
that's<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.360> essence<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.870> life<00:01:24.080> uh

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
yeah so how long does that take well

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.200 
yeah so how long does that take well
anywhere<00:01:27.590> from<00:01:27.950> six<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.550> twelve<00:01:28.880> hours

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
anywhere from six to twelve hours

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.610 
anywhere from six to twelve hours
depends<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.690> temperature<00:01:29.870> nothing

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
depends on the temperature nothing

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.170 
depends on the temperature nothing
depends<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.520> know<00:01:31.640> where<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.880> have<00:01:32.030> them
