00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
synthetic bones been shaped let's move

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.020 
synthetic bones been shaped let's move
on<00:00:32.559> to<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.739> next<00:00:32.770> step

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.720 

all<00:00:38.750> right<00:00:39.020> with<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.770> synthetic<00:00:40.219> bone<00:00:40.370> in<00:00:40.640> the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
all right with the synthetic bone in the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.799 
all right with the synthetic bone in the
correct<00:00:41.059> position

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.090 

right<00:00:46.809> now<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.140> secure<00:00:47.559> it<00:00:47.649> with<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.800> plate

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
right now to secure it with a plate

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.200 
right now to secure it with a plate
prepare<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.239> drill<00:00:50.670> drill<00:00:51.670> deep<00:00:51.909> enough

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
prepare the drill drill deep enough

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:03.140 
prepare the drill drill deep enough
without<00:00:52.390> touching<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:52.989> guidelines<00:00:53.409> okay

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:34.640 

how

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.110 

bring<00:01:35.650> out<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.800> plate<00:01:38.520> screws<00:01:39.520> go<00:01:39.730> in<00:01:39.880> up<00:01:40.090> to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
bring out the plate screws go in up to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:53.090 
bring out the plate screws go in up to
the<00:01:40.330> guy<00:01:40.480> got<00:01:41.230> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.670 

good<00:01:54.100> good<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:54.909> going<00:01:55.210> well<00:01:55.530> femoral<00:01:56.530> neck

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
good good it's going well femoral neck

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.490 
good good it's going well femoral neck
is<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:56.950> next<00:01:57.400> step

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.400 

this<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.190> often<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:02.630> area<00:02:02.990> has<00:02:03.170> been

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
this is often this area has been

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.340 
this is often this area has been
completely<00:02:03.950> shattered<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.900> looks<00:02:06.080> like<00:02:06.170> we

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
completely shattered it looks like we

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.020 
completely shattered it looks like we
have<00:02:06.380> no<00:02:06.620> choice<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.250> replace<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:07.940> an

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
have no choice but to replace it with an

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.240 
have no choice but to replace it with an
artificial<00:02:08.360> joint<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:09.590> let's<00:02:09.920> start<00:02:10.130> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
artificial joint right let's start this

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.220 
artificial joint right let's start this
quickly<00:02:10.550> first<00:02:11.300> we<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.660> extract<00:02:12.080> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
quickly first we have to extract the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.500 
quickly first we have to extract the
bone<00:02:12.440> fragments

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.020 

keep<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.840> with<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.050> other<00:02:18.170> pieces<00:02:18.440> too

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.000 

we<00:02:21.420> need<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.660> work<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.260> stem<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.920> be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
we need to work on it to the stem can be

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.850 
we need to work on it to the stem can be
driven<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:24.140> don't<00:02:25.140> leave<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> guideline

driven in don't leave the guideline
using<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.819> saw<00:02:27.030> isn't<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.600> using<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:28.050> scalpel

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:03:27.390 

good<00:02:34.329> good<00:02:34.810> there's<00:02:35.409> no<00:02:35.650> need<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.890> hurry

that should do it can you bring out the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.680 
that should do it can you bring out the
stem<00:03:30.200> make<00:03:30.980> sure<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.400> secure<00:03:31.520> but<00:03:32.330> don't<00:03:32.540> hit
