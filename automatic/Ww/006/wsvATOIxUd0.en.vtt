00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
push in with the marker by the way I'm

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.270 
push in with the marker by the way I'm
gonna<00:01:10.880> draw<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.420> slightly<00:01:11.990> thinner<00:01:12.380> line<00:01:12.680> but

gonna draw a slightly thinner line but
I'm<00:01:13.370> gonna<00:01:13.460> make<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:13.850> one<00:01:14.030> jaggedy<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.890> this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
I'm gonna make this one jaggedy and this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:26.830 
I'm gonna make this one jaggedy and this
is<00:01:16.040> gonna<00:01:16.220> be<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.580> brim<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.910> his<00:01:17.120> hat<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:25.840> we

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
can tell exactly what it is and this is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.899 
can tell exactly what it is and this is
gonna<00:01:37.460> overlap<00:01:37.880> since<00:01:39.100> its<00:01:40.100> cloth<00:01:40.430> cloth

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
overlaps and then I'm gonna make a

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.859 
overlaps and then I'm gonna make a
jaggedy<00:01:45.250> ball<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:49.720> draw<00:01:50.720> some

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
jaggedy ball on that and draw some

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.910

it's bait I'm basically just drawing I'm
basically<00:02:43.579> drawing<00:02:43.880> back<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.420> curve<00:02:44.690> sheet

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
basically drawing back that curve sheet

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.900 
basically drawing back that curve sheet
just<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:46.000> curve<00:02:48.040> like<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:49.730> I'm

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
just a curve like that like so I'm

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.100 
just a curve like that like so I'm
putting<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.299> everywhere<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:50.690> connecting

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
