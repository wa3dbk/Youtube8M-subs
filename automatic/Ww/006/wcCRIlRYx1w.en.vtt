00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.700
 good to all but a new video 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.650
 good the video that good that is 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.260
 I've been waiting 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.440
 testing the vital game contrast the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.240
 global offensive good save a little the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.820
 opinion the point of view and above all 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.440
 make clear some people who are 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.789
 thinking about buying themselves the best they have 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.619
 doubts first on ps3 probably ps3 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.480
 this European will probably come out the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.680
 Wednesday is valid or expected until the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.080
 Wednesday I do not know on Wednesday we want 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.910
 know what date they give what they are and how 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.620
 but good for now the date is 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.050
 Wednesday next week 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.359
 when to update the story again 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.499
 same but because we have to be the 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.539
 Wednesday because it is delayed more 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:44.989
 shameful I 'm going to do so I have 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.249
 of American history I have the one of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.249
 xbox and from American history 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 stress and canada that I think the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.460
 game to see the game appears very good 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.019
 in fact it had not been for a long time 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.269
 I tried a first-person shooter 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.159
 multiplayer is really filled me 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.150
 both by killing a person or by doing 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.710
 a good round 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.110
 with a good round the reaction to what 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.810
 better to kill two three four or even 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.690
 five that is the maximum are five against 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.369
 five the most you'll see in 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.250
 global containment offensive in consoles 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.130
 will not always be more I think not and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.590
 really good is to say first I do not see 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.229
 no difference between xbox and ps3 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.320
 since it is a PC port with which 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.979
 because they are the same two are both 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.289
 equal the one of pc is superior to the others 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.490
 two and the other moles are somewhat worse 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.490
 but in the other similar 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.550
 to say the game said it seems very 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.290
 very good especially 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.680
 I started 3 someone has doubts you can 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.950
 play with usb mouse and with usb keyboard 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.300
 Well, someone, we are used to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.220
 and such and I just want to buy for 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.170
 consoles and has played all his life with 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 mouse and keyboard as you can can 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.470
 buy a mouse that is a mouse and a 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.310
 keyboard that are 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.369
 usb compatible with pc you will have in some 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.650
 page or something nothing from May because I do not like 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.570
 I do not play with a keyboard and mouse 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.830
 I have no idea which ones can serve 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.210
 but well I guess in forums and such 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.390
 you can ask and surely you 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.170
 answer as I say many people have 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.210
 asked is better is normal 3 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 really can we can not be 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.970
 compare in fact the only one that really 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.980
 we could compare it you can not 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.770
 compare either and it would be that the 24 already 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 you all know that every 24 was born of 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 counter-strike already said infinity ward 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.980
 in fact they were very inspired and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.630
 really if I liked that the 24 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.340
 I'm going to like this game a lot more 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.810
 since it is the original not really 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.680
 as I said a long time ago 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.480
 it really is also a game that you 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 reward for playing well do not you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.010
 reward for being a pack of shit 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.230
 for changing us there are many things that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.930
 you have many, many, too many 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.390
 so many that it even scares and it's a game 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.370
 as I say for people that good does not stop 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.819
 people who really are bad or if you 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.810
 kill you can not overwhelm yourself 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.849
 being overwhelmed is foolish because 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.190
 really plays very good people I the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.620
 whores you know only if they have whores 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.510
 for the best kill one or two and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.610
 it's really hard especially I'm 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.220
 talking about blogs search and destroy 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.920
 not as competitive as he as the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.600
 another casual is a way that really 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.459
 it costs going down killing then we have to 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.170
 give away more than one eye costs less 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.780
 since he is reborn if the others are 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.910
 always appear and there are several things that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.459
 make you can not really or not 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.840
 recompense campear maybe that's what 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.360
 you can not aim although it has been possible 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.069
 I found premiere you can also point 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.200
 you do not have low spells with which you do not 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.489
 it's worth changing or nothing and what 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.600
 best of all you have a system of 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.390
 money 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.160
 depending on how the round or your team comes out 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.960
 as good as you are going to have more money 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.130
 less against more more money 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.500
 You will also be able to buy more 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.440
 grenades or grenades of any kind or 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.140
 things of any kind you will be able to 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.730
 buy which then does everything very very 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.230
 good and that really try you 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.420
 overcome that round and go with a little 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.550
 more care 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.850
 can play in several ways both 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.920
 I asarco as little by little really 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.540
 to learn from the maps first I 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.790
 I recommend going safe to learn 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.370
 the maps then already when you know by 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.320
 where are you going to make people and neither 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.910
 in turning the corners with care 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.890
 everything will turn spent when it's a long 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.680
 distance you know if you're going to be released 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.170
 Well, by far, you have more precision 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.790
 especially shoot short bursts if you 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.590
 can sometimes by video for example this 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.050
 bad little nervous and I'll get to 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.160
 finally, that's why you do not have to 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.680
 do 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.880
 but as I say then you have to take the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.620
 measure every maps you have but has 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.290
 enough weapons we also have many 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.680
 to give the game enough variety 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.419
 the sniper to the format according to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.750
 has made moderator better and others 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.630
 worse 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.070
 the best weapon for now I get the 47 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.780
 which is what I was advised by many 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.180
 people really is a weapon very subject 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.970
 very good dynamic especially allows you 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.840
 do many things and really have to say 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.950
 is the first with 33 that we have in 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.750
 consoles of this generation and really 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.150
 I thought it was a game totally 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.760
 incredible not for a garbage price 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.290
 although it is a 15 euro that is nothing or 15 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.330
 dollars that really there's nothing for 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.120
 what really offers that the really 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.740
 because it is much hilarity I 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.540
 I really do not recommend people who 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.790
 buy it if you are waiting for them 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.280
 waiting to make 20-0 games 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.110
 of 15-0 because he's not going to get it 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.060
 if you're looking for a difficult game in the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.010
 that you kill and you feel rewarded if 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.810
 with this you will get quite in the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.700
 that with each game garments and with this 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.470
 what are you going to get also in which 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.270
 play with friends who will reward 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.970
 also if you are also going to get it but 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.310
 if you look for the opposite, you do not, you do not go 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.600
 to get this game is not for you 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.240
 mates two shots of three shots 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.790
 it really is not, it's not, it's not 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.930
 nothing 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.700
 what else to say the only bad point that 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.200
 I really see how to look like a 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.830
 foolish many but for me it is 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.820
 important is that it does not have a ranking 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.680
 deserved points because I know he has 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.250
 ranking but do a little bit weird 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.690
 no ranking similar to those of white 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.640
 do not replace them 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.920
 I mean a ranking of points of 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.110
 low and such the mind is the only 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.550
 bad point because you will say many because 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.410
 angel is stupid because to me 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.000
 I really like to compete in the ranking 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.170
 really, it's something that calls me 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.290
 a lot of attention and really makes 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.630
 I have much more vision a game and I 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.310
 give more to play is not a thing is a 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.050
 incentive for me is very important not 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.640
 I really like to be among the first 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.890
 of the ranking I'm not always very 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.630
 competitive in those subjects and I take it 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.330
 very seriously really do not have a 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.550
 ranking thus low points and such in 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.700
 consoles for really better than a little 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.430
 No, but as I say, that's just my 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.870
 point of view that will be for many a 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.340
 foolish not like I say because a lot of people 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.130
 he does not have time to be all the 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.380
 day there playing and being markers 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.420
 and so with what I think that if 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.620
 you are thinking of buying some 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.720
 and really with my words or 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.250
 He has convinced me anything everything 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.530
 otherwise it has been prevented that works and 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.140
 money really for one thing who does not 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.930
 I will have fun because nothing I feel 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.430
 good and good kids nothing else this has 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.030
 been everything if we see each other in the next 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.030
 video until next time
