00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 in this video we are going to 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.510
 present how we put the ballast 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.810
 using a machine the inspiration 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 to simplify and industrialize the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 process it is obviously in a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.810
 first time to deposit the ballast 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 here we integrated it into a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.090
 container whose opening width of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 collar is slightly higher than the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.760
 width of times we consider 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.160
 obviously the voices laid down on 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.160
 their soles here cork 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.420
 the inspiration machine is composed of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.339
 three elements 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.890
 the first of course the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.580
 for us a vertical vacuum that 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.460
 we have been using for years to 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 the end the suction tip and a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 intermediate jar of recovery us 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.369
 usually used to pose the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.380
 ballast by a break in the hand with 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.729
 equalizer brush and brush 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.740
 sky that thanks to this choice it comes in 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.630
 equalizing the ballast grains 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.840
 between the sleepers so as to arrive 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.899
 just below their surface and without 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.640
 overflow or leave grains on 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.039
 shots are the inspiration is set a 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.520
 sufficient level to allow this 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.240
 work in accelerated and aspiring 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 also on the sidewalls 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.500
 to realize 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.370
 the simulation of the ballast thickness 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.780
 actually jÃ©gou constituted by the 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.780
 cork sole 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 the suction tip and realized in 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.580
 copper tubes welded to the state the mouthpiece 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.520
 he himself is tinged whose extremities 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.270
 horizontals were obstructed and its 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.430
 experienced bleeding is practiced on any 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.480
 the width of the tea is completed by 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.910
 dolphin at the spacing of the rails 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.850
 an extension tube makes it possible to fix the tube 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.390
 suction here entry into force 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.390
 it can also be attached with a collar 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.870
 between the nozzle and the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.240
 we insert an intermediate jar it is 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.720
 decided to recover the ballast 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.330
 surplus aspires and possibly 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.100
 replacing in the end by a vacuum cleaner a 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.770
 suction nozzle with a small 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.820
 brush it also helps to recover 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.910
 the small pieces broken or falling off 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.230
 convoys when cleaning the network this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.950
 which must be done obviously 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.950
 regularly 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.380
 once the ballast totally inspired 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.290
 and equalize on the tracks we proceed to 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.730
 his collage we use 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.970
 traditionally the classic mix 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.100
 of white glue diluted at a rate of two 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.410
 third of water and added a few 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.540
 drops of washing up liquid intended for 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.100
 remove the surface tension and 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.520
 to allow a better 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.360
 impregnation of the ballast grains by 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.650
 glue we proceed here by wide 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.280
 application by following the girls of 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.490
 voice and overflowing widely for 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.730
 perfectly paste the entire 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.730
 ballast 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.350
 the last operation consists of 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.300
 remove the little bubbles that can 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.790
 to raise the edges and bottom of the ballast 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.850
 with a little point we just drill 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.740
 the bubble put back the grains for 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.220
 plug the hole 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.340
 still fluid and liquid glue 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.780
 will complete the standardization and you 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.780
 will not see these traces any more 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.780
 minutes 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.270
 worried
