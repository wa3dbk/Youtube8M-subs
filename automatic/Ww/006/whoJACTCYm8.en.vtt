00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
quite a bit this gameplay was a little

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.630 
quite a bit this gameplay was a little
bit<00:00:57.239> difficult<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
bit difficult for me to get because I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.569 
bit difficult for me to get because I
couldn't<00:01:00.120> exactly<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:01.309> sometimes<00:01:02.309> if

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
couldn't exactly like sometimes if

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.939

people would wear red things and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
people would wear red things and
depending<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> background<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.750> couldn't

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
depending on the background I couldn't

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
depending on the background I couldn't
really<00:01:07.229> tell<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.650> were<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.340> sometimes

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really tell they were there so sometimes

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590

I<00:01:09.750> had<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.610> difficulty<00:01:12.030> comfort

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

I had a little bit of difficulty comfort
clubs<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.290> stuff<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> wasn't<00:01:13.920> really

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
clubs and stuff but it wasn't really

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that bad I hit this pi bond I was really

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.660 
that bad I hit this pi bond I was really
excited<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.040> why<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> jumped<00:01:17.490> off

excited I don't know why I jumped off
and<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.909> should<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.180> shot<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and I should have shot there for the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.590 
and I should have shot there for the
vibe<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.619> twice<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> didn't<00:01:21.119> happen<00:01:21.210> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
it's all good but yeah so this gameplay

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.749

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this off I was like when I hit that clip

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
this off I was like when I hit that clip
I<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.840> okay<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:43.560> for

this<00:01:43.799> anymore<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> didn't<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.360> long

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this anymore I didn't go for that long

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
this anymore I didn't go for that long
but<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.619> still<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.280> difficult

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but it was still a little bit difficult

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
but it was still a little bit difficult
for<00:01:47.850> me<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> play<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.649> just

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
for me to play like this it was just

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440

like<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.250> messing<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.850> eyes<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
like I got a headache afterwards and I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
like I got a headache afterwards and I
kind<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> felt<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.610> sick<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.180> honest

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
of the it's one of the easiest for me to

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.430 
of the it's one of the easiest for me to
hit<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.850> one<00:03:08.210> that<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:09.110> it's<00:03:09.290> the

hit but it's one that like it's the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.650 
hit but it's one that like it's the
easiest<00:03:09.740> gameplay<00:03:10.100> for<00:03:10.310> me<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.490> hit<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.270> it's

easiest gameplay for me to hit but it's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.510 
easiest gameplay for me to hit but it's
like<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.380> takes<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:12.710> bit<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.890> time<00:03:13.040> takes

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
like it takes a little bit of time takes

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.800 
like it takes a little bit of time takes
a<00:03:13.580> little<00:03:13.670> bit<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.850> time<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> got<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.660> I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
a little bit of time and I got it like I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.210 
a little bit of time and I got it like I
got<00:03:14.960> to<00:03:15.050> make<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.410> recording<00:03:15.740> for<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.070> that's

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
got to make a recording for it that's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.350 
got to make a recording for it that's
kind<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.610> difference<00:03:16.730> like<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.240> to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
kind of the difference like I have to

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.180 
kind of the difference like I have to
make<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.750> recording<00:03:18.200> for<00:03:18.710> this<00:03:18.830> type<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.010> stuff

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
make a recording for this type of stuff

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.430 
make a recording for this type of stuff
so<00:03:19.520> we're<00:03:20.480> going<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.660> draw<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.840> video<00:03:21.050> I'll

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
so we're going to draw the video I'll
