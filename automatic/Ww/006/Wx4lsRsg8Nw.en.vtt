it<00:01:19.909> is<00:01:20.119> better<00:01:20.359> than<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.689> Genesis<00:01:21.079> version

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
it is better than the Genesis version

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.739 
it is better than the Genesis version
but<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.280> Genesis<00:01:22.670> had<00:01:22.819> an<00:01:22.939> excuse<00:01:23.389> for<00:01:23.569> being

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
but the Genesis had an excuse for being

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.410 
but the Genesis had an excuse for being
worse<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.319> was<00:01:24.740> an<00:01:24.859> older<00:01:25.100> system<00:01:25.460> but<00:01:26.149> because

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
worse it was an older system but because

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.300 
worse it was an older system but because
he<00:01:26.509> was<00:01:26.569> on<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.810> 32x<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.619> was<00:01:28.009> released

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
he was on the 32x and was released

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.859 
he was on the 32x and was released
almost<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.729> year<00:01:28.909> later<00:01:29.179> than<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.479> Genesis

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
almost a year later than the Genesis

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.649 
almost a year later than the Genesis
version<00:01:30.229> one<00:01:31.039> would<00:01:31.189> expect<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.819> lot<00:01:32.179> more<00:01:32.209> than

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
version one would expect a lot more than

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.169 
version one would expect a lot more than
the<00:01:32.810> little<00:01:32.959> updates<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.679> were<00:01:33.799> added<00:01:34.179> it

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
the little updates that were added it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.620 
the little updates that were added it
really<00:01:35.479> should<00:01:35.719> have<00:01:35.749> been<00:01:35.929> a<00:01:35.990> better<00:01:36.229> player

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
really should have been a better player

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.870 
really should have been a better player
