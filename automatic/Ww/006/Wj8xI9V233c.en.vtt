00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 it is said that those who eat fine lentils 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.700
 year may have luck and money what 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.160
 wish for more 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 well I would say a nice slice of cotechino 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 but also pay the palate found 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.990
 you too 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.839
 as you may have guessed today I would like to propose you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.730
 the classic cotechino with lentils 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.840
 or a typical dish of Christmas 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.789
 year-end holidays 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 but I would like to propose it in the version 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.160
 as light as possible as simple 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.529
 we will first cook the cotechino or 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.019
 vapor therefore we will make him sweat well and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 we will renew as much fat as possible 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 sales instead we will cook later 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.149
 use in the gully lard 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.890
 let's get to work to prepare the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.710
 cotechino with lentils are 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.910
 250 grams of lentils needed 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.320
 dried a nice fresh cotechino from 600 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 grams 2 carrots about 150 grams a few 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.620
 celery costs some bay leaves 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 clearly pepper and salt a goccino of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 extra virgin olive oil 500 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 about milliliters of vegetable broth a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 spoon of tomato paste e 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 a new 2 cloves of garlic before 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 start with the preparation and two 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 words about lentils as I told you 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 during the presentation of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 ingredients or used lenses that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.450
 dried and must be cooked before cooking 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.189
 soak in cold water 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 for at least 12 hours 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.960
 so I put it in the night before 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
 soaking and after 12 hours this is the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 result 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.869
 what I did rinsed well for 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 lenses that also eliminate all 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 anti-nutritional elements that are i 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 trust me and this is the result 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 now let's get the cotechino ready 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 since it takes a little more time than 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.579
 cooking with regard to cotechino 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.950
 we said we have to cook a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.180
 steam to make me take everything in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.729
 excess fat 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.090
 but first I recommend you 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.090
 puncture the gut in this way 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.690
 because I do this for 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.220
 to prevent the cotechino skopje during 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 cooking 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.959
 if we move well into the steam pot 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.380
 we put it here then during cooking 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.840
 clearly it will also lose volumes 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.840
 we cover and cook for about three hours 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 until our cotechino is cooked 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.150
 we prepare lentils 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.489
 I have already carried on and I have 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.519
 mounted the vegetables so I cleaned for 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.560
 well the celery clearly or peeled 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.840
 the carrot cut into small pieces e 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.920
 try with the blender and this is the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 result 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.870
 many people also use it 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.050
 shallot and onion I clearly not 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 I use them we go to a small one 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.430
 casserole or in a saucepan 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.330
 from the right dimensions so that the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.700
 lenses that are not dispersed cheever 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 we are also our carrot expert 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.470
 celery we add a couple of spoons 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.320
 of extra virgin olive oil two tablespoons are 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.620
 sufficient therefore not used nor the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.840
 lard nor butter this way the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.500
 dish will still be tasty but very tasty 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.500
 lighter 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.890
 let's mix well let's get on as well 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 flames we also add a clove 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.970
 of garlic in shirt 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.720
 and tomato concentrate perhaps 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.610
 we also dissolve the concentrate of 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:47.860
 tomato adding a little broth 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:52.060
 better if warm or otherwise warm and 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.230
 brown for 2 3 minutes once 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:06.880
 we browned our base we can 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:09.220
 add the lentils and we make for 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.130
 well flavored 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.340
 now we can also cover the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.230
 lentils with vegetable broth maybe 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.350
 let's raise the flame to maintain 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.770
 however the boiling we bring therefore 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.870
 to boil just as I told you 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:34.720
 we close with the lid we will add 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:37.240
 then the salt and pepper at the end is 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.580
 an hour and a half passed and ours 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.680
 lenses that are slowly cooked and 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.690
 they absorbed all the liquid 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.420
 check often during cooking 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.890
 and if you see that the liquid is there 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.680
 dried too add you ca n't like 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.020
 I told you before we put the salt of pepper 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.400
 only at this point why add the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.190
 salt now because they are we go to 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.350
 add it before salts harden the 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.890
 pellicina the coating and each 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.890
 lentil 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.260
 perfect and now we only add in 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.840
 this phase also a leaflet of 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.350
 laurel because their tastes very much 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.570
 strong then would tend to cover the 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.190
 taste of the lenses that we have it 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.430
 let's add now five minutes earlier 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.430
 of the term you will hear the result 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.680
 let's take a look at the Skillet 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.260
 cotechino 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:45.770
 here it is, as I said, it has shrunk 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.770
 in size and volume it is almost ready 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.220
 recapitulating our cotechino 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.890
 abolished for three hours or better 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.710
 steamed for three hours 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.810
 see again where you see the little holes 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.790
 currently it would have exploded during the 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.410
 cooking in this way manages to 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.030
 stay nice compact 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.760
 now I put on my gloves because 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.250
 because I go to work it when still 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.910
 very hot to get out to remove 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.910
 easily the coating as well 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.460
 and you see that the gut is removed a lot 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.460
 easily 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.720
 I'm already cutting my affection and then 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.230
 we go immediately to serve him with ours 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.230
 lentils 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.300
 here it is our beautiful cotechino with 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.340
 lentils try it yourself a 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.590
 serve it with some potato tour 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.450
 you will just hear that delight 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.310
 in short, with this light variant 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.200
 besides luck, money is 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.630
 we should not be satisfied with the building 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.350
 not even worry about the good line 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.350
 parties to you all
