00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.260
 we'll see each other win 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.349
 a chaotic 1000 situation in one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 class flying paper planes 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.580
 there is played with the phones there are 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.579
 it is a fight and right in this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.439
 situation bursts the blank into worry 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.320
 for order and starts the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.300
 lesson with a test and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 this lesson kittler and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.149
 piece by piece ans delete 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 We spent a whole week together 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.850
 the students worked on the film 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 31 students were involved in the project 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 they've even entered four 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.560
 groups and then we have in these 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 for three days rhythmic 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.050
 material works small choreographies 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.480
 worked out few spiritual discussed 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.040
 the attitute works out the same 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 Student ice cream and student groups in the movie 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.799
 should occur 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.119
 and then we have the whole two days 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.119
 long shot is taboo 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.159
 I wanted to watch the film dance in the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.990
 set up a new school and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 create simultaneous result if that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 all involved are proud and that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.909
 has more time than one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.590
 unique performance and simultaneously 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.159
 also a bigger public 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.799
 then reached the film for me in the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 a emotional story too 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.479
 tell and a greater density too 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.989
 create 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.459
 that would be so within a week with 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.000
 students have never danced before 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.420
 have at a stage performance 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.319
 probably much more difficult 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 been 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:10.579
 he does work tomic but that means the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.579
 body gives exactly the other way senators 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 56 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 all partners our school system exists 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.430
 to a large extent from the head plastic 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.290
 Subjects of motion applications 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.319
 overall is very low 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.470
 Our schools are designed to be good 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.629
 to generate educated workforce 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.290
 What to train for less 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.230
 Submissions are creative minds themselves 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.209
 aware of their own creativity 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.209
 or actually create it as 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.030
 us for this reason I would like to than 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.439
 establish teaching because I believe 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.870
 that dance to a large extent the claim 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.159
 it does justice to creativity and more 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.280
 to bring movement to school 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.090
 Students experience themselves in dance lessons 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.080
 quite fast 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.690
 as competent as creative as 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.940
 powerful and they experience themselves and 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.620
 your classmates as creative and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.569
 learn your body as an instrument 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.709
 know with which she is incredibly great 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.709
 things can do 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.870
 pressed too late 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.070
 the feedback on the movie is scary 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.260
 Great 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 the students are very proud of it 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.230
 make this pride is the movie 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.680
 at youtube is 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.940
 They keep track of the clicks you ask 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.360
 I'm already on the next dance 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 project in the mother has become direct 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.490
 thanked her after the project week 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.410
 for your daughter to spend a whole week 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.060
 I like to go to school every day 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.490
 every day on the project 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.020
 was happy and that's exactly what they are 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.340
 moments that fascinate me as a teacher 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.080
 Students are looking forward to school students 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.910
 are looking forward to working on something 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.520
 And you are proud of the result 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.260
 and then that's the feedback from others 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.590
 People who do not participate in a project 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.800
 are just as fascinated 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.260
 many adult friends and acquaintances 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.510
 have seen this movie and say something 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.850
 we would have given 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.560
 to have such dancing and teaching and 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.680
 that shows me how many people so 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.590
 what wish and it shows at the same time 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.360
 how necessary such projects are 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.210
 do and with just such projects 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.410
 can pave the way for it side 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.410
 would be on the way 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.199
 Why
