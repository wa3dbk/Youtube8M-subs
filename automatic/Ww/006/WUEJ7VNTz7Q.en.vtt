00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.710
 haarlem welcome to these heracles today i was showing you how 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.909
 can finish a pot of ten 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.719
 by going to work with the second colors and hitting the double and then 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.789
 by grabbing the first color 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.960
 first off to the apple app you get full for disinfecting 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.320
 first time came pace newspaper and the small line with stabbing and another 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.019
 color can to the side 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 and then that woods chain on the right 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.530
 first of all 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 because you can build up color sore 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.280
 the rank and file 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.380
 stand it 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.640
 on the backside 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.830
 with the cnossen chain on the right 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.830
 at least the console had a needle in a tent 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.470
 had already paid 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.110
 so they go 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 can make 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.630
 and then we see here 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.300
 the first hole 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.500
 lierse it goes 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 and not through it can already see a little blue from the other regions 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.720
 and so that cannot be resolved between the sticks 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.510
 next to a quarter 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.560
 he pops through the loose one 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.490
 through that hole 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 just release so you have in fact 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 loose chain caught so called behind 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
 there you see stab and 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.950
 you make 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 the cluster 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.150
 those sticks 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 I'm doing well now 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.240
 some sun 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.650
 and then I stand another hero through the second and then we find again 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.780
 unloading endeavors with stabbing can be a bit out of this way 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.350
 and then we can there 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 insert the needle like this 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 the new one at the back he sits by the separate packages between the two 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 been chopsticks 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.719
 and so get her on the rest of the rich af m every time then as your arms 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.379
 could go the other way when he comes so at the end 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.099
 then turn potholder 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.179
 and then you do the same on the other side 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.759
 that is it
