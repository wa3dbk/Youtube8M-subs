00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:16.580
 but to make the homemade scrub mask 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.250
 you will need a bowl and then a 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.849
 Fork with a fork of a spoon 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.449
 and that's it and something to stir 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.949
 so I actually took a kit or 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.419
 salty for dyes to their 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.320
 files well that's inside 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.170
 you have graduations and that you 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 lets see pretty much what you 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.110
 put so to start you go 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.870
 you will need to take south 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.640
 then you can take sugar in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.370
 powder or fine semolina sugar like 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.760
 here and there I have these two hours 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.470
 times but you can also take 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.119
 you know the big pieces of sugar 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.979
 to make the chouquettes something 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:14.020
 like that so 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.020
 you put in everything then pretty much a 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:29.500
 two so you feel free to fill 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:29.500
 still well there that the spoon 3 4 5 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.479
 6 7 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 8 9 and 10 ch d as you can see in 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 did I showed you with the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.010
 spoons it's for people 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.400
 graduation companion in their bowls 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.800
 or things like that so 10 10 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.080
 spoons it's pretty much pretty much 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.440
 so that then you will need him 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.330
 the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.770
 so I took olive oil 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 Virgin 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:21.209
 so this is the mark carapelli here I 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.560
 use it kitchen so here it is 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.380
 really but really well 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.170
 so then you put that then it's okay 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.610
 actually depend on the amount of sugar 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.520
 that you have issued but generally 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.980
 for 10 spoons of sugar 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:53.390
 it takes about a month 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:59.810
 What amount of oil that's 4 and 5 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:02.940
 and then you will stir like that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:11.480
 so that will give you a kind a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.480
 kind of very consistent dough 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 we stir it up until 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.459
 the sugar is totally absorbed the oil 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.950
 so you see there for 5 5 spoons 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.750
 of oil for 10 tablespoons of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.030
 sugar 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.300
 it's really it's really 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.410
 quantities it takes to have 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.540
 a nice house scrub so at what is 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.150
 good with olive oil is that you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430
 have the fragrance with this mix with the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.570
 sugar finally it's really it's 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.960
 really great so here and I thank 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.240

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.600

 in fact I tried this scrub the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.360

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.210

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.920

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.019
 a species of packs a little bit you 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.110
 know like when you do the paws 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.990
 sandblasted it's a little bit like it looks like 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.280
 little bit of that so here is it after you 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.640

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.280

 really remove with the small grains 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.080
 hold all the little dead skin 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.850
