00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.380 

all<00:00:03.270> right<00:00:03.419> so<00:00:03.629> here's<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.110> quicker<00:00:04.350> one<00:00:04.650> on

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
all right so here's a quicker one on

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.299 
all right so here's a quicker one on
McComas<00:00:06.390> all<00:00:06.540> nitrate<00:00:07.340> and<00:00:09.559> Megatech<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.860> I'll

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
McComas all nitrate and Megatech so I'll

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.890 
McComas all nitrate and Megatech so I'll
start<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.639> Mexico<00:00:12.120> sighs<00:00:12.360> quicker<00:00:12.630> so

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
start with Mexico sighs quicker so

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.510 
start with Mexico sighs quicker so
magnetic<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.679> basically<00:00:14.809> formulated<00:00:15.809> for

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
magnetic was basically formulated for

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.240 
magnetic was basically formulated for
horses<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:18.810> used<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.230> horses<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:20.130> their

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
horses to be used on horses for their

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
horses to be used on horses for their
Mane's<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> Tails<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.660> also<00:00:21.810> found<00:00:22.230> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
Mane's and Tails and it also found it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.609 
Mane's and Tails and it also found it
was<00:00:22.650> found<00:00:22.680> soon<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.490> hoof<00:00:23.789> growth<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
was found soon from of hoof growth and

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
was found soon from of hoof growth and
basically<00:00:25.619> they've<00:00:25.830> done<00:00:26.160> humans<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.330> safe

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
basically they've done humans it's safe

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
basically they've done humans it's safe
for<00:00:27.689> human<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.019> because<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.710> basically

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
for human use because it's basically

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
for human use because it's basically
very<00:00:29.160> high<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.849> proteins<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> strengthens

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
very high in proteins so it strengthens

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
very high in proteins so it strengthens
the<00:00:31.619> hair<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.340> found<00:00:32.550> first<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> lot<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the hair and they found first a lot of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.420 
the hair and they found first a lot of
chemotherapy<00:00:33.989> patients<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:34.980> helped<00:00:35.219> them

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
chemotherapy patients it's helped them

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
chemotherapy patients it's helped them
regrow<00:00:36.270> their<00:00:36.510> hair<00:00:36.780> regrow<00:00:37.170> thicker<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
regrow their hair regrow thicker and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.440 
regrow their hair regrow thicker and
stronger<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.050> they<00:00:40.050> sell<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> websites

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
stronger so they sell it on the websites

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
stronger so they sell it on the websites
as<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.350> say<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.860> human<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.520> says<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
as also say for human use and it says so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.590 
as also say for human use and it says so
on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> bottom<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.390> well

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
on the bottom as well

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.490 
on the bottom as well
however<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:48.030> responses<00:00:48.840> things<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> people

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
however the responses things that people

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.729 
however the responses things that people
the<00:00:50.809> effects<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> are

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the effects people get from it are

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
the effects people get from it are
different<00:00:53.100> some<00:00:53.579> people<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:53.969> find<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
different some people just find a bit of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.000 
different some people just find a bit of
thickness<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.050> people<00:00:55.289> time<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> makes

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
thickness some people time that it makes

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.650 
thickness some people time that it makes
a<00:00:56.129> hair<00:00:56.309> very<00:00:56.489> hard<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.940> protein<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
a hair very hard because protein in

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
a hair very hard because protein in
their<00:00:57.809> protein<00:00:57.840> sensitive<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:59.489> people<00:00:59.730> have

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
their protein sensitive some people have

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
their protein sensitive some people have
fun<00:01:00.120> any<00:01:00.390> changes<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.289> their<00:01:01.530> hair<00:01:02.430> grows

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
fun any changes in their hair grows

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
fun any changes in their hair grows
while<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.239> people<00:01:03.359> find<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.870> increases

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
while some people find it increases

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.030 
while some people find it increases
their<00:01:04.559> shedding<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> lot<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
their shedding by a lot so you kind of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310 
their shedding by a lot so you kind of
pushing<00:01:08.520> by<00:01:08.909> trying<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> stimulate<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.110> hair

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
pushing by trying to stimulate more hair

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
pushing by trying to stimulate more hair
growth<00:01:10.350> you're<00:01:10.710> pushing<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.130> near<00:01:11.310> further

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
growth you're pushing your near further

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.020 
growth you're pushing your near further
and<00:01:12.119> faster<00:01:13.100> through<00:01:14.100> its<00:01:14.340> hair<00:01:14.549> growth<00:01:14.760> cycle

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and faster through its hair growth cycle

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
and faster through its hair growth cycle
to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> shedding<00:01:15.840> phase<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:18.140> Megatech<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to the shedding phase so so Megatech you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
to the shedding phase so so Megatech you
can<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> may<00:01:21.509> not

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
can use it if you want but it may not

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.100 
can use it if you want but it may not
make<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> difference<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.360> it's<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.689> 13

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
make a difference to you it's just a 13

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
make a difference to you it's just a 13
it's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.070> very<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.490> mean<00:01:26.549> fact<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.299> use<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's a very I mean fact I use it as a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's a very I mean fact I use it as a
protein<00:01:29.479> conditioner<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.790> did

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
protein conditioner now because I did

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
protein conditioner now because I did
find<00:01:33.119> any<00:01:33.360> difference<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.840> my<00:01:33.960> gross<00:01:34.380> braids

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
find any difference in my gross braids

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.940 
find any difference in my gross braids
or<00:01:34.890> anything<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.570> we've<00:01:37.560> talked<00:01:37.770> about

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
or anything so there we've talked about

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.679 
or anything so there we've talked about
McConnell's<00:01:38.579> online<00:01:38.850> training<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> works

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
McConnell's online training how it works

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
McConnell's online training how it works
so<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> colors<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.540> nitrates<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.890> synthetic

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so the colors all nitrates are synthetic

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.440 
so the colors all nitrates are synthetic
antifungals<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.070> they

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
antifungals and they

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.429 
antifungals and they
in<00:01:47.540> Nebraska's<00:01:48.409> common<00:01:49.780> skin<00:01:50.780> nice<00:01:51.110> and

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
in Nebraska's common skin nice and

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.390 
in Nebraska's common skin nice and
things<00:01:51.650> they<00:01:52.159> are<00:01:52.220> used<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.670> topical<00:01:53.950> new<00:01:54.950> from

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
things they are used in topical new from

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.100 
things they are used in topical new from
mucous<00:01:55.729> membranes<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.360> steering<00:01:56.750> these

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
mucous membranes and steering these

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.940 
mucous membranes and steering these
infections<00:01:58.060> there<00:01:59.060> good<00:01:59.330> oxidizing<00:02:00.170> agents

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
infections there good oxidizing agents

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.310 
infections there good oxidizing agents
and<00:02:01.070> nitrates<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.700> they<00:02:02.360> provide<00:02:02.750> oxygen<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
and nitrates so they provide oxygen to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.560 
and nitrates so they provide oxygen to
the<00:02:03.500> hair<00:02:03.799> when<00:02:04.100> using<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.490> process<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.240> hair
