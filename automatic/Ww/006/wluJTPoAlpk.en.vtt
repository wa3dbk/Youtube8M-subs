 money laundering is the process of 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.560
 hide income from activities 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.020
 illegal so that they can not 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.869
 be linked to criminal activity 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.660
 hsbc admitted the failure in the controls and 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.369
 he apologized in a statement on Tuesday 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.100
 the agreement followed a published report 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.590
 by the senate of the us at the beginning 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.930
 of this year which identifies the bank 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.120
 based in the united kingdom as a channel 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.290
 for drug lords and countries 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.149
 rogues hsbc was accused of not treating 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.760
 its subsidiary to Mexico as high risk 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.770
 despite the widespread laundering of money and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.990
 drug trafficking problems of this 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.780
 country 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.060
 circumvent the safeguards of the USA and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.850
 even allowing 25,000 transactions 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.650
 without revealing his ties to Iran and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.900
 also for providing services to some 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.640
 banks in Saudi Arabia despite 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.880
 be linked to the financing of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.260
 terrorism to the east mccray analyst of ig 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 markets says that hsbc has already allocated 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 1.5 billion to cover the fine 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.460
 well this is certainly not a good 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.200
 news but to put it that way in the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 second and third trimesters 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 hsbc had arranged between 700 and 800 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.490
 millions of dollars 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 so they had already allocated 1,500 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 millions for this and the beginning of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.690
 November they commented that they thought 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.750
 that the fine could finally be a lot 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.910
 greater so to some extent already what 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.330
 they had billed the agreement is the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.070
 third time in a decade that hsbc has 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.070
 been sanctioned by lax controls 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 and that the US authorities have 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.770
 ordered a better monitoring of the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 suspicious transactions
