00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.050 
very very old car but it looks like it
was<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:54.990> taken<00:03:55.350> care<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:56.070> mean<00:03:56.610> for<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
was well taken care of I mean for the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.480 
was well taken care of I mean for the
most<00:03:57.210> part<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:58.530> doesn't<00:03:58.740> look<00:03:58.860> dirty<00:03:59.370> or

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
most part it doesn't look dirty or

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.050 
most part it doesn't look dirty or
anything

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
anything

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.450 
anything
it's<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.290> carpets<00:04:01.680> are<00:04:01.830> very<00:04:02.010> clean<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
it's the carpets are very clean as you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.640 
it's the carpets are very clean as you
can<00:04:02.700> see<00:04:02.910> right<00:04:03.060> down<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.360> actually<00:04:03.690> just

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
can see right down there actually just

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.960 
can see right down there actually just
dump<00:04:04.950> some<00:04:05.160> stuff<00:04:05.280> out<00:04:05.550> of<00:04:05.670> here

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
dump some stuff out of here

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.020 
dump some stuff out of here
so<00:04:06.270> this<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> 1988<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.500> said<00:04:07.910> get<00:04:08.910> back

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
so this is a 1988 like I said get back

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.300 
so this is a 1988 like I said get back
in<00:04:09.150> there<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.900> never<00:04:09.990> happened

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
in there that never happened

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.210 
in there that never happened
and<00:04:12.210> I<00:04:12.270> said<00:04:12.480> 5-speed<00:04:12.900> manual<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.440> bajillion

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
and I said 5-speed manual a bajillion

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.090 
and I said 5-speed manual a bajillion
miles<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.700> play<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.920> that<00:04:17.010> was

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
miles to play and I think that was

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.180 
miles to play and I think that was
fourth<00:04:17.370> gear<00:04:17.960> so<00:04:18.960> I<00:04:19.230> mean<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.560> still<00:04:19.770> shifts

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
fourth gear so I mean it still shifts

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.910 
fourth gear so I mean it still shifts
headliner<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.330> very<00:04:21.570> crispy<00:04:21.989> it's<00:04:22.260> old<00:04:22.470> vinyl

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
headliner is very crispy it's old vinyl

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.400 
headliner is very crispy it's old vinyl
you<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.760> see<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.480> have<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.630> little<00:04:24.870> interior

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
you can see you have a little interior

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.820 
you can see you have a little interior
dome<00:04:25.530> wire<00:04:25.800> right<00:04:25.950> back<00:04:26.130> there<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.620> we'll<00:04:28.740> go

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
dome wire right back there so we'll go

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.260 
dome wire right back there so we'll go
ahead<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.340> come<00:04:29.670> around<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> hood<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
ahead and come around to the hood you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.490 
ahead and come around to the hood you
can<00:04:30.300> see<00:04:30.510> there's<00:04:30.690> lots<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.960> room<00:04:31.140> in<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.320> back

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
can see there's lots of room in the back

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.520 
can see there's lots of room in the back

far forward I'd love to see the handling
on<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:00.190> thing<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.430> bet<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.730> just<00:05:00.760> kind<00:05:01.060> of

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
on this thing I bet it just kind of

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.800 
on this thing I bet it just kind of
flips<00:05:01.360> around<00:05:01.510> like<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> big<00:05:01.930> old<00:05:02.110> boat<00:05:03.570> but<00:05:04.570> I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
flips around like a big old boat but I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.810 
flips around like a big old boat but I
mean<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.169> looks<00:05:05.410> relatively<00:05:05.919> clean<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.460> I'm

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
mean it looks relatively clean and I'm

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.340 
mean it looks relatively clean and I'm
sure<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.150> still<00:05:07.330> runs<00:05:07.570> like<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.810> champ

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
sure it still runs like a champ

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.440 
sure it still runs like a champ
even<00:05:08.980> after<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:09.400> many<00:05:09.430> miles<00:05:09.970> in<00:05:10.210> as<00:05:10.300> many

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
even after as many miles in as many

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.560 
even after as many miles in as many
years<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:11.290> uses<00:05:11.830> its<00:05:12.190> seeing<00:05:12.550> doesn't<00:05:13.450> really

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
years of uses its seeing doesn't really

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.590 
years of uses its seeing doesn't really
appear<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.020> much<00:05:14.139> rust<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:15.310> I'm<00:05:16.300> really
