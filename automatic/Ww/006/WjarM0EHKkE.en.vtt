00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 among the women, the battle was about it 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 gold between the forest and schc 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.559
 both teams started the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.630
 contest was in the eighth minute so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.900
 open in bosch via vera 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.900
 vorstenbosch 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 not much later the foresters received 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.490
 the chance to run to 2 0 with 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.970
 Fredric Matla saw purchase could have stopped 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.320
 are disguised by fcs e coli ping 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 shortly thereafter, however, it was hit 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.590
 ease at ease of rest was a new man 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.410
 from the punishment cone this they back in the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 contest 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.829
 after rest there were opportunities and both sides 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 but also due to good goalkeeper work 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.770
 it was long 218 minutes before the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 then still hit the bush 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.399
 Matla with her second in the competition 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 put the final score and that one on the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.640
 gate 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.180
 through the victory power and forest 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.850
 year champion denominator 2 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.479
 goals congratulations thank you 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.370
 you yes yes yes I had hoped 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.110
 why then did the other damage not come 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.150
 once 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 and it seemed pretty easy to look at 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.090
 you can't take me in the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.670
 problems that's right 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.680
 yes it felt like whole 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.380
 west number have had control 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.520
 so yes we have it very business together 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.580
 played with his all 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.490
 so no crazy things done 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.020
 just as seen every match and yes 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.190
 nicely done 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.550
 we fought for balls worth 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.830
 were the bosc wanted would wiki 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.420
 so I think now should do with four 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.979
 keep man's spaces very small and have them 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.930
 We have never done this season we 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.850
 have always been busy 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.310
 always want to play hockey and yes you will 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.960
 card abolished because you created 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.520
 also few this law filming on or 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.869
 see that traffic to seeing does not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.250
 wrong but bon moment that a team 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.960
 with four man's own circle 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.410
 defend there is little to create in my 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.990
 eyes 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.610
 nice ball take away what we did ourselves 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.740
 few in the turnovers 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.720
 yes they just did it smart mail times 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.450
 just the man away that we 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.709
 could not accelerate and yes you know 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 that is just a difficult match 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.550
 be they objective has never been 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.899
 recently to become our champion 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.640
 objective was not even actually 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.920
 complete only when we went to two 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.430
 three weekends just stood at the top and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.590
 actually 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.940
 contests bomb whatever it takes me 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.740
 something like that we just go for it and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.080
 They did it today and they did 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.090
 have fought card and yes what I say 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.310
 we are not behind the team 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 to walk to sit back we have 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.330
 today also just played busy yes and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.459
 you make some of the however that 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.790
 if you try then they will not always succeed 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.790
 did well
