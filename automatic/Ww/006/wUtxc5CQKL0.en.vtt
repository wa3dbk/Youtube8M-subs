00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.980
 U 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.980
 U 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:21.830
 Why do I have to make a full-fledged video shoot with my dslr? 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:25.760
 What components are needed to take a picture? Yes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.869
 One of the most necessary things is the maxillary time 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.870
 In general, now that ball head is what I know here 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:38.270
 For the camera, it's a ball head web. 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 Yes, it's not really a big problem to just shoot a still image. 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:48.440
 Usually, in the video, the screen moves to the left and right and moves up and down 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.410
 If you use a ball head like this , 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.410
 Because I'm rich, I use a lot of other brands 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.630
 U 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:14.330
 In front of the four yo , this optimized Brad 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.640
 For fish oil without CAD indeyo If you look a little bit so smoothly moving 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.200
 So there is actually a tendency 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.200
 When the camera is on birthday . 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.590
 Yes, the ball head is a bit cracky , 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 It was only a little puleojyeoseo stop by the shop to handle the motion moved so 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.110
 Softer 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:42.080
 This can be helpful when shooting video 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.900
 4 Now on the tripod for the camera , 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.540
 You can use it. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:56.000
 Yes , using a tripod that used to be a conventional still camera, 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.750
 If you change only the dslr is not heavy enough to use 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.750
 There is 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:08.030
 And if such practice two outermost profile 01 also has what hdv high 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.070
 The amateur and professional five are also slightly mobile, so the most compact 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.070
 We use it as CAD without a lot of u 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 Now , when I was shooting that kind of video of the high picture, 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.220
 I think the memory card is going to be a bit more important now. 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.300
 Because if you play something like hd now it's a bit expensive for a video car 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:38.580
 So tell what kind of memory but we recommend to use examples or memory card 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.330
 In the case of a memory image, such as a French image , 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.310
 As you said, there are 100 people who can go beyond the beginning, 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.560
 I'll be gone soon 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:54.840
 So I think you should use as many as 16 giga as possible . 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 Yes, and the body has what sd card, for example, requires small shop sd card between 11th 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 Inde most fit more on what entry-level camera, in other cases such as this daebong 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.269
 I recommend it because it is compatible . 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.190
 What I am using now is a cf card like this 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.510
 I'd like a lot to spend on the non-fortified For sd card 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:20.760
 That's what I'm putting in numbers . Oh, yeah. 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.319
 fhd In the case of projection , continue to shoot at 5 pixels, continue to large capacity 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.540
 I guess I have something to save. 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:33.230
 If you are using large, fast writing speeds , 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.230
 You can take pictures and prevent errors that may happen later 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.800
 U 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.800
