Today, many Real-KOKEkun appears around Shibuya and Harajuku.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.380
After the bubble period when the mind destruction of people was severe, they were rarely seen. 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.940
However, spiritual movement to care about oneself has become active since last year, 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.560
Real-KOKEkun can inhabit once again, an expert says.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.360

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.200
Necessary nutrient for Real-KOKEkun is bright and fun atmosphere and people's smile. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.020
Temporary,  such environment has gone in Tokyo.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.340
They inhabit only in foreign countries or the part of suburban area.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.420
In the past few years, people now focus on to spiritual wealth than material wealth. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.200
As a result, no longer look at them with disapproval nor crack down. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.440
In other words, no more make fun of Real-KOKEkun. But many smiles around Real-KOKEkun.

Nobody insults Real-KOKEkun.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.800
People in town take a photo and shake hands with Real-KOKEkun.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.560
Dr. Kokemori, people cherish their own, so the phenomenon disappears which ridicule others. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.600
We can say that?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.080
Well, 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.160
Real-KOKEkun is probably the barometer to measure the spirit level of the city of people. 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100
They might be teased when they go out to the city.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.120
Still, they will become moss by making the whole body green. 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.620
There is no distinction for them after they changed into moss. 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.340
It does not matter academic achievement nor athletic ability.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
They become moss even beyond nationality. 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.580
The environment is finally ready to welcome such Real-KOKEkun.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.680
