00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.019
 [Music] 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 the Chinese Ministry of Affairs 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.240
 exteriors practically rejects 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 daily what he perceives already as a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.700
 military threat from japan 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 Beijing recently announced that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.279
 will draw up a map of the islands in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 dispute will do it although tokio receives with 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.400
 shots to the air to the Chinese ships that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 move to the conflict zone 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 continues stagnating since September 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 when Japan decided to nationalize the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 islands unilaterally unleashing the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.089
 Chinese anger so entrenched is the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.059
 conflict that very few dare to 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.059
 rule out the possibility of a war 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.129
 This is a situation that continues in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.720
 Chinese time and Japan are playing 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
 with the possibility of conflict 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.519
 armed and it is japan who with his last 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.540
 performances is getting worse since 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.730
 time things for drift 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 climbing around the archipelago is 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.000
 constant the map that China wants to make 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.940
 of the diaoyu islands is another proof and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 the consensus here is that China should 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.030
 stay firm in your position until the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.860
 last consequences and let's come one 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 chibola the Japanese government follows 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 resorting to the army to harass 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 the Japanese ships are sending Japanese 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.900
 fighter planes when china china 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.479
 the islands with non-military aircraft 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 all this leaves very few options to the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.710
 Chinese authorities any concession 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 made from Beijing will be seen by the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.660
 public opinion as a clear sign 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 of weakness whatever Chinese may be what 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.570
 demands is to return to the status quo prior to the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 Japanese nationalization of the islands a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.850
 status quo that kept them as 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.880
 disputed territory but also without 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.310
 owner the islands diaoyu-senkaku follow 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.970
 causing tensions in China and Japan 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 both countries claim their sovereignty and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.070
 Each step they take increases the tension 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.110
 diplomatic nobody knows very well how 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.240
 This conflict can end 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 although the consensus here is that you should 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.990
 settle down as soon as possible to avoid 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.450
 greater political and economic instability 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.450
