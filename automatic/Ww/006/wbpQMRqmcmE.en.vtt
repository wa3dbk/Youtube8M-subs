rock<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.580> although<00:01:21.940> this<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.690> not<00:01:22.720> real<00:01:23.200> rock

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
rock so although this is not real rock

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.870 
rock so although this is not real rock
you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.770> see<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.009> certainly<00:01:24.280> does<00:01:24.520> have<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
you can see it certainly does have the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.710 
you can see it certainly does have the
appearance<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.390> such<00:01:25.740> nice<00:01:26.740> looking<00:01:27.720> nice

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
appearance of such nice looking nice

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.270 
appearance of such nice looking nice
looking<00:01:29.110> setup<00:01:29.439> and<00:01:29.619> what<00:01:29.710> they<00:01:29.830> did<00:01:30.040> in<00:01:30.159> this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
looking setup and what they did in this

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.429 
looking setup and what they did in this
case<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.820> they<00:01:31.390> get<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.570> simple<00:01:32.049> stamped

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
case is they get a simple stamped

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.819 
case is they get a simple stamped
concrete<00:01:32.970> beyond<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.420> three<00:01:35.200> co-op<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:35.710> they

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
concrete beyond the three co-op so they

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.440 
concrete beyond the three co-op so they
did<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.979> really<00:01:36.009> good<00:01:36.310> job<00:01:36.450> especially

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
did a really good job especially

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.260 
did a really good job especially
considering<00:01:38.259> if<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:39.070> look<00:01:39.880> at<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.240> can

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
considering if you look at it you can

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.260 
considering if you look at it you can
see<00:01:40.390> how<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.750> coping<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> lot<00:01:42.040> overhangs<00:01:42.970> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
see how the coping a lot overhangs the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.649 
see how the coping a lot overhangs the
fiberglass<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.170> that's<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.680> key<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:46.030> to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
fiberglass and that's the key to so to

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.560 
fiberglass and that's the key to so to
making<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:47.229> look<00:01:47.619> as<00:01:47.829> natural<00:01:48.040> as<00:01:48.369> possible<00:01:48.610> if

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
making it look as natural as possible if

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.050 
making it look as natural as possible if
the<00:01:49.600> rock<00:01:50.259> sits<00:01:50.530> on<00:01:50.680> top<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.159> pool<00:01:51.369> it's

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the rock sits on top of the pool it's

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.010 
the rock sits on top of the pool it's
not<00:01:52.329> nearly<00:01:52.570> going<00:01:52.840> to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
not nearly going to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.399 
not nearly going to
the<00:01:53.170> same<00:01:53.409> effect<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.929> again<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.170> have<00:01:56.289> you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
the same effect and again you have you

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.410 
the same effect and again you have you
spill<00:01:56.710> over<00:01:56.950> water<00:01:57.189> feature<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.210> see<00:01:58.359> how

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
spill over water feature and you see how

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.270 
spill over water feature and you see how
they<00:01:58.509> did<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.780> skimmer<00:01:59.049> on<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.380> end<00:01:59.590> so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
they did the skimmer on the end so

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.069 
they did the skimmer on the end so
that's<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.700> Riviera<00:02:01.539> 34<00:02:02.490> by<00:02:03.659> leezar<00:02:04.659> pools
