00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:02.420
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.090
 so here is another star 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.500
 among the most 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.989
 and we installed on it 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.509
 the co-pilot 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.489
 and since 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.489
 in the front we go now to test the navigation 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.419
 with their address 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.419
 we apprehend very paris 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.999
 in the city center 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.999
 we think it's not very, very quickly 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.610
 by train 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.140
 to calculate 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 nurseries trips 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.710
 I think it must be said that that the light roughly 4 5 minutes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 before that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 paris will find a solution 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.490
 the idea very very long 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.490
 to get going 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 so he has now found the revolution 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.960
 j 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.270
 you may be 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 the ford team will decrease 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 jean charest continues his way 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 I know 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
 this is for this test remember that the young woman 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.989
 it's no 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.199
 minsk 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.950
 the old one correctly 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 but these cuts 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.049
 the sound is that 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.049
 the only thing I love 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.959
 leclerc a good month for patients 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.959
 when launching the navigation system 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 but after he behaves like a normal gps 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.459
 this is what we are saying to you soon for new tests
