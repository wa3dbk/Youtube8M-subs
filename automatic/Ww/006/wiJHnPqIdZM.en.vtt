as much as I would love to see his

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
as much as I would love to see his
portrayal<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> Batman<00:00:39.390> Bruce<00:00:39.660> Wayne<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.110> fact

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
portrayal of Batman Bruce Wayne in fact

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
portrayal of Batman Bruce Wayne in fact
I<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:40.950> think<00:00:41.250> he<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.700> great

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I actually think he would be a great

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
I actually think he would be a great
Bruce<00:00:42.450> Wayne<00:00:42.750> yeah<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
Bruce Wayne yeah you really has that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.110 
Bruce Wayne yeah you really has that
look<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:45.590> multi-mode<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.739> billionaire<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
look of a multi-mode I billionaire so I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
look of a multi-mode I billionaire so I
think<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.719> could<00:00:48.840> pull<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> Bruce<00:00:49.649> Wayne

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
think you could pull off the Bruce Wayne

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.090 
think you could pull off the Bruce Wayne
persona<00:00:50.809> but<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> Batman<00:00:52.379> persona<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
persona but the Batman persona is the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.529 
persona but the Batman persona is the
one<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> problem<00:00:54.149> with

one that I kind of have a problem with

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.439

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because Ben Affleck has had a long

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.229 
because Ben Affleck has had a long
history<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:58.109> being<00:00:58.859> part<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> box-office

he never really pulls in an audience

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.120 
he never really pulls in an audience
during<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> summer<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.020> saying<00:01:46.350> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
during the summer was what I'm saying so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.940 
during the summer was what I'm saying so
it's<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> weird<00:01:48.329> choice<00:01:48.950> considering

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it's kind of a weird choice considering

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's kind of a weird choice considering
his<00:01:50.430> track<00:01:50.820> record<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:52.040> blockbuster<00:01:53.040> star

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
his track record as a blockbuster star

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
his track record as a blockbuster star
he<00:01:53.399> never<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.360> great<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:55.530> did

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
he never really was a great one he did

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.990 
he never really was a great one he did
better<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.880> part<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.640> awards<00:01:59.640> crowd

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
better more as part of the awards crowd

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.719 
better more as part of the awards crowd
you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:01.950> does<00:02:02.159> better<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you know and I think he does better as a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
you know and I think he does better as a
director<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.780> does<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.380> actor<00:02:04.799> not

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
director that he does as an actor not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.480 
director that he does as an actor not
saying<00:02:05.250> he's<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> bad<00:02:05.549> actor<00:02:06.210> my

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
saying he's a bad actor my

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.749 
saying he's a bad actor my
jus<00:02:06.700> but<00:02:07.270> his<00:02:07.780> craft<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.380> more<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.860> directing

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
jus but his craft is more of directing
