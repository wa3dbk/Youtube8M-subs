I've<00:03:16.200> ever<00:03:16.409> seen<00:03:16.650> our<00:03:16.829> life<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.079> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
I've ever seen our life so you have to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.569 
I've ever seen our life so you have to
kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.799> of<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.040> way<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.400> not

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
kind of think of it that way it's not

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.180 
kind of think of it that way it's not
the<00:03:20.730> most<00:03:21.290> amazing<00:03:22.290> artwork<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.799> design<00:03:23.040> that

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the most amazing artwork in design that

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.319 
the most amazing artwork in design that
could<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.609> bit<00:03:23.760> better<00:03:23.940> but

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
could be a little bit better but

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.750 
could be a little bit better but
originality<00:03:25.260> wise<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.950> storyline<00:03:26.430> wise<00:03:26.579> I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
originality wise and storyline wise I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.129 
originality wise and storyline wise I
think<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.030> just<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.209> beautiful<00:03:27.329> application

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
think it's just a beautiful application

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.430 
think it's just a beautiful application
and<00:03:28.799> again<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.160> whole<00:03:29.720> idea<00:03:30.720> behind<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.290> is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and again the whole idea behind it is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.740 
and again the whole idea behind it is
the<00:03:31.500> stars<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.790> having<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.329> great<00:03:33.450> adventure

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
the stars and having a great adventure

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750 
the stars and having a great adventure
and<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.169> power<00:03:34.379> of<00:03:34.500> imagination<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.459> also

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and the power of imagination and also

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.909 
and the power of imagination and also
positive<00:03:36.269> reinforcement<00:03:36.870> which<00:03:36.959> are<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
definitely think that they did a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.839 
definitely think that they did a
wonderful<00:03:48.900> job<00:03:49.139> with<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.620> storyline<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
wonderful job with the storyline and

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.879 
wonderful job with the storyline and
with<00:03:51.060> keeping<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.510> very<00:03:51.709> positive<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.799> very

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
with keeping it very positive and very

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.879 
with keeping it very positive and very
child<00:03:53.370> appropriate<00:03:53.989> as<00:03:54.989> well<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.530> scope<00:03:55.799> of

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
child appropriate as well this scope of

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:56.720 
child appropriate as well this scope of
things<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.160> could<00:03:56.220> use<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> little<00:03:56.549> bit

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
things that could use a little bit

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.680 
things that could use a little bit
improved<00:03:57.000> by<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.269> think<00:03:57.389> they<00:03:57.510> could<00:03:57.660> a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
improved by just think they could a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.289 
improved by just think they could a
little<00:03:58.139> better<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.530> animation<00:03:59.010> maybe

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
little better with the animation maybe

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.879 
little better with the animation maybe
and<00:04:00.299> since<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:00.870> do<00:04:00.959> expect<00:04:01.199> so<00:04:01.650> much<00:04:01.829> from
