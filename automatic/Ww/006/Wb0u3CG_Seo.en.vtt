skull<00:00:09.389> texture<00:00:10.290> theory<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.010> guess<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.340> could

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
skull texture theory I guess you could

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.430 
skull texture theory I guess you could
call<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.030> lot<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> people<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.929> recently

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
call it a lot of people have recently

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.799 
call it a lot of people have recently
been<00:00:13.620> speculating<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.150> Bonnie

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
been speculating that in the Bonnie

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.820 
been speculating that in the Bonnie
animatronic<00:00:17.119> endoskeleton<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.300> old<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.869> I'm

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
animatronic endoskeleton the old one I'm

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.080 
animatronic endoskeleton the old one I'm
gonna<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.100> gonna<00:00:20.160> clarify<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.820> because

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
gonna I'm gonna clarify that because

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.580 
gonna I'm gonna clarify that because
it's<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> only<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.080> without<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.350> face

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
it's it's the only one without a face

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
it's it's the only one without a face
you<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> clear<00:00:23.430> shot<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:24.000> his

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you can get a clear shot of his

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
you can get a clear shot of his
endoskeleton<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.740> body<00:00:25.949> without<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.250> face

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
endoskeleton so the body without a face

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.970 
endoskeleton so the body without a face
so<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> old<00:00:27.570> bonnie<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.109> lot<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> people<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
so the old bonnie a lot of people in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.650 
so the old bonnie a lot of people in
speculating<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> texture<00:00:30.390> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
speculating that there's a texture in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
speculating that there's a texture in
his<00:00:30.779> endoskeleton<00:00:31.650> metal<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.850> looks<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
his endoskeleton metal that looks like a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510 
his endoskeleton metal that looks like a
skull<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.170> during<00:00:34.559> his<00:00:34.680> jump<00:00:35.040> scare<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
skull and it's during his jump scare and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.680 
skull and it's during his jump scare and
i'll<00:00:35.610> show<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> picture<00:00:36.390> somebody

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
i'll show you the picture somebody

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.340 
i'll show you the picture somebody
tweeted<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> mean<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.320> circled<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:39.350> it's

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
tweeted I mean he circled it and it's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.069 
tweeted I mean he circled it and it's
not<00:00:40.940> true<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.809> saying<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
not true like I'm not saying the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.979 
not true like I'm not saying the
pictures<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:44.100> real<00:00:44.460> cuz<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
pictures not real cuz it is it's in the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.000 
pictures not real cuz it is it's in the
game<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> whole<00:00:49.020> skull<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> it's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
game but the whole skull thing it's it's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
game but the whole skull thing it's it's
not<00:00:50.190> real<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:50.940> real<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.809> are

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
not real it's not real and there are

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
not real it's not real and there are
many<00:00:52.110> pictures<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> prove<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> wrong<00:00:53.070> I'm

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
many pictures to prove it wrong I'm

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.619 
many pictures to prove it wrong I'm
gonna<00:00:53.430> show<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.640> guys<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> screen

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
gonna show you guys I'm on the screen

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.810 
gonna show you guys I'm on the screen
now<00:00:54.840> there's<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.920> Bonnie<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> vent

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now there's some of Bonnie in the vent

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
now there's some of Bonnie in the vent
that's<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.960> proves<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.469> they're

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that's that that proves that they're

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
that's that that proves that they're
like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> textures<00:00:59.460> different<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.059> another

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like the textures different it's another

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750 
like the textures different it's another
close-up<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:01.109> Bonnie<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
close-up of Bonnie and you can see that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
close-up of Bonnie and you can see that
there's<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.120> skull<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.930> his<00:01:03.989> face<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.920> mean<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there's no skull on his face I mean it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
there's no skull on his face I mean it
kind<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.489> does<00:01:05.670> look<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> skull<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
kind of does look like a skull in the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
kind of does look like a skull in the
end<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> place<00:01:07.590> where<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.909> place<00:01:09.119> where

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
end the place where in the place where

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
end the place where in the place where
the<00:01:10.260> guys<00:01:10.409> circled<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.430> shot

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the guys circled it in the first shot

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.039 
the guys circled it in the first shot
but<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> next<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.810> where

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
but if you look at the next one where

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
but if you look at the next one where
Bonnie's<00:01:16.409> actually<00:01:16.830> standing<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.159> front<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Bonnie's actually standing in front of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
Bonnie's actually standing in front of
your<00:01:17.610> desk<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.630> he<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> when<00:01:19.590> he<00:01:19.650> makes

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
your desk when he kind of when he makes

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.980 
your desk when he kind of when he makes
his<00:01:19.920> way<00:01:20.040> into<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.400> room<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.570> clearly

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
his way into your room you can clearly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.190 
his way into your room you can clearly
see<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.710> his<00:01:22.860> face<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:24.030> texture<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
see on his face there is no texture that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
see on his face there is no texture that
looks<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> skull<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.060> kind

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
looks like a skull at all it's just kind

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.760 
looks like a skull at all it's just kind
of<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.530> picture

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of it's a it's a very good picture

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.719 
of it's a it's a very good picture
actually<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.310> debunk<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.880> theory<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.270> well

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
actually to debunk this theory as well

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.010 
actually to debunk this theory as well
and<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.390> no<00:01:33.570> texture

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and you can see that there's no texture

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
and you can see that there's no texture
that<00:01:34.140> makes<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> skull<00:01:35.159> face<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.640> anything

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that makes out a skull face or anything

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
that makes out a skull face or anything
like<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.920> about

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
like that and if you really think about

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
like that and if you really think about
it<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.340> relevance<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.570> have

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
trick I don't really know if it's even a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.550 
trick I don't really know if it's even a
theory<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.700> either<00:02:40.000> way<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:41.260> wanted<00:02:41.410> ring
