00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
century French mathematician Abraham

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.670 
century French mathematician Abraham
tomorrow<00:00:14.700> he's<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> friend<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.690> Isaac<00:00:16.199> Newton's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
tomorrow he's a friend of Isaac Newton's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.560 
tomorrow he's a friend of Isaac Newton's
so<00:00:17.190> basically<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.119> thing<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.390> need<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
so basically the first thing we need to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.550 
so basically the first thing we need to
do<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.050> convert<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.100> into<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:21.170> sine<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
do is convert this one into a sine and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
do is convert this one into a sine and
cosine<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.580> scientist<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.660> bounded<00:00:25.410> by<00:00:26.599> plus

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
cosine but scientist is bounded by plus

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720 
cosine but scientist is bounded by plus
1<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.230> minus<00:00:28.260> 1<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.039> first<00:00:29.369> thing<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.609> going

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
1 and minus 1 so first thing we're going

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.110 
1 and minus 1 so first thing we're going
to<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> gonna<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.800> take<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.880> 8th

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
to do is gonna to take one to the 8th

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
to do is gonna to take one to the 8th
and<00:00:33.440> then<00:00:34.440> 2<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> 8th<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.550> reason<00:00:35.850> I'm

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and then 2 to the 8th the reason I'm

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.470 
and then 2 to the 8th the reason I'm
doing<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.590> gotta<00:00:37.829> convert

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
doing this one is I gotta convert

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.740 
doing this one is I gotta convert
radical<00:00:39.480> 3<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> minus<00:00:40.320> 1<00:00:40.770> into<00:00:41.670> sine<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
radical 3 and minus 1 into sine and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.600 
radical 3 and minus 1 into sine and
cosines<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> value<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:47.690> recognized<00:00:48.690> by

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
cosines the value can be recognized by

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.930 
cosines the value can be recognized by
those<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.940> okay<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> did<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.940> rolled

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
those two okay so what I did is I rolled

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
those two okay so what I did is I rolled
this<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.510> inside<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.210> exponential

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this one inside because the exponential

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.930 
this one inside because the exponential
matches<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.370> relatively

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
matches okay from here it's relatively

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.740 
matches okay from here it's relatively
easy<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.870> first<00:01:01.170> term<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.770> cosine<00:01:02.609> function

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
easy the first term is a cosine function

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.890 
easy the first term is a cosine function
cosine<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.110> negative<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:05.090> Quadrant<00:01:06.090> 2<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.630> 3

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
cosine is negative in Quadrant 2 and 3

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
cosine is negative in Quadrant 2 and 3
sine<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.010> positive<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:09.710> Quadrant<00:01:10.710> 1<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.549> 2

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sine is positive in Quadrant 1 and 2

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.679 
sine is positive in Quadrant 1 and 2
ok<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.900> obviously<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> quadrant<00:01:15.390> 2

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
ok so obviously I have a quadrant 2

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
ok so obviously I have a quadrant 2
angle<00:01:16.189> here<00:01:17.189> okay<00:01:17.970> cosine<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> 1/2<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:21.259> my

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
angle here okay cosine is 1/2 so my

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
angle here okay cosine is 1/2 so my
angle<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.360> PI<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.390> 2<00:01:24.890> plus<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.369> 30-degree

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
angle is PI over 2 plus a 30-degree

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200 
angle is PI over 2 plus a 30-degree
which<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> PI<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.110> 6<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.250> basically<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
which is PI over 6 so basically I have a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:39.050 
which is PI over 6 so basically I have a
7<00:01:31.140> PI<00:01:31.350> over<00:01:32.600> 3<00:01:33.600> 4<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> 4<00:01:34.829> 5<00:01:35.040> 6<00:01:37.670> 3<00:01:38.670> yeah<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
7 PI over 3 4 I have a 4 5 6 3 yeah I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460 
7 PI over 3 4 I have a 4 5 6 3 yeah I
have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> 4<00:01:39.600> PI<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:39.990> 6

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
have a 4 PI over 6

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
have a 4 PI over 6
ok<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.009> let's<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.549> started<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> 2<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
ok so let's get started you go to 2 to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.789 
ok so let's get started you go to 2 to
the<00:01:43.350> 8th<00:01:44.840> cosine<00:01:45.890> 4<00:01:46.890> PI<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.610> 6<00:01:49.159> plus<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.659> sine<00:01:51.799> 4

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the 8th cosine 4 PI over 6 plus I sine 4

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.370 
the 8th cosine 4 PI over 6 plus I sine 4
PI<00:01:53.100> over<00:01:53.520> 6<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> 8th<00:01:55.619> okay<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.909> here's<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
PI over 6 to the 8th okay now here's the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
PI over 6 to the 8th okay now here's the
theorem<00:01:58.380> comes<00:01:59.149> along<00:02:00.149> 0<00:02:01.079> 2<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> 8th<00:02:02.310> leave

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
theorem comes along 0 2 to the 8th leave

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.800 
theorem comes along 0 2 to the 8th leave
it<00:02:03.299> alone<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.530> cosine<00:02:05.159> 8<00:02:06.030> times

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it alone and then I have cosine 8 times

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.179 
it alone and then I have cosine 8 times
4<00:02:07.259> PI<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.890> 6<00:02:08.310> plus<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.619> sine

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.979 

8<00:02:15.189> times<00:02:15.760> 4<00:02:16.299> PI<00:02:16.569> over<00:02:17.019> 6<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.730> 8<00:02:19.000> gets

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
8 times 4 PI over 6 so this 8 gets

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.550 
8 times 4 PI over 6 so this 8 gets
absorbed<00:02:20.290> inside<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.430> sine<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.329> cosine<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
absorbed inside the sine and cosine so

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
absorbed inside the sine and cosine so
if<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.010> about<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.790> pretty

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
if you think about it this is pretty

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.360 
if you think about it this is pretty
clever<00:02:25.709> 2<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> 8th<00:02:28.260> ok<00:02:29.260> let's<00:02:29.829> take<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.129> look

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
clever 2 to the 8th ok let's take a look

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.339 
clever 2 to the 8th ok let's take a look
at<00:02:30.519> where<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.269> cosine<00:02:31.780> angle<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:33.000> 32<00:02:34.000> pi

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
at where this cosine angle is 32 pi

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.520 
at where this cosine angle is 32 pi
divided<00:02:35.349> by<00:02:35.379> 6<00:02:35.799> it's<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.760> equal<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.239> 5<00:02:38.170> PI

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
divided by 6 it's really equal to 5 PI

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.069 
divided by 6 it's really equal to 5 PI
plus<00:02:40.530> PI<00:02:41.530> over<00:02:41.890> 3<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.829> let's<00:02:44.829> divide<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.400> by<00:02:46.079> 2

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
plus PI over 3 so let's divide it by 2

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.520 
plus PI over 3 so let's divide it by 2
here<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:47.560> you'll<00:02:47.739> see<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.159> is<00:02:48.370> 16<00:02:48.909> PI<00:02:49.230> over<00:02:50.230> 3

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
here and you'll see this is 16 PI over 3

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.520 
here and you'll see this is 16 PI over 3
so<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.799> have<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.129> 16<00:02:51.639> PI<00:02:51.819> over<00:02:52.150> 3<00:02:52.420> over<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.690> all

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
so I have a 16 PI over 3 over here all

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.879 
so I have a 16 PI over 3 over here all
right

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
right

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.509 
right
this<00:02:54.459> angle<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.950> third<00:02:57.220> quadrant

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
this angle is in the third quadrant

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.819 
this angle is in the third quadrant
because<00:02:57.970> every<00:02:58.510> 2<00:02:58.690> pi<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:58.959> go<00:02:59.200> around<00:02:59.349> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
because every 2 pi you go around and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.649 
because every 2 pi you go around and
then<00:03:00.310> come<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.819> PI<00:03:01.000> again<00:03:01.359> you're<00:03:01.540> going

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
then come to the PI again you're going

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.379 
then come to the PI again you're going
to<00:03:01.720> go<00:03:01.989> another<00:03:02.349> 60<00:03:02.889> degrees<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.730> here's<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
to go another 60 degrees so here's the

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.890 
to go another 60 degrees so here's the
angle<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.750> quadrant<00:03:08.739> 3<00:03:09.069> both<00:03:10.060> scientist

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
angle and this quadrant 3 both scientist

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.770 
angle and this quadrant 3 both scientist
on<00:03:11.109> your<00:03:11.290> negative<00:03:11.829> ok<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.730> have<00:03:13.060> negative

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
on your negative ok so I have negative

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.059 
on your negative ok so I have negative
1/2<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.829> one<00:03:15.069> plus<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.079> radical<00:03:17.079> 3<00:03:17.680> over<00:03:17.889> 2

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
1/2 for this one plus I radical 3 over 2

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.430 
1/2 for this one plus I radical 3 over 2
with<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.879> negative<00:03:19.000> sorry

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.020 

since<00:03:23.440> there's<00:03:23.709> 2<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.190> 8th<00:03:24.340> I'm<00:03:24.699> going<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
since there's 2 to the 8th I'm going to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.030 
since there's 2 to the 8th I'm going to
use<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.449> it's<00:03:25.690> minus<00:03:26.019> 2<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> seventh

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
use that it's minus 2 to the seventh

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.599 
use that it's minus 2 to the seventh
plus<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.949> with<00:03:29.949> a<00:03:29.980> minus<00:03:30.400> sign

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
plus I with a minus sign

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.449 
plus I with a minus sign
twist<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.599> seventh<00:03:32.049> radical<00:03:32.829> 3<00:03:35.129> 2<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
twist the seventh radical 3 2 to the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.610 
twist the seventh radical 3 2 to the
seventh<00:03:36.879> happen<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> minus<00:03:38.109> 128<00:03:39.359> minus

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
seventh happen to be a minus 128 minus

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.490 
seventh happen to be a minus 128 minus
128<00:03:42.389> radical<00:03:43.389> 3<00:03:45.419> right<00:03:46.419> so<00:03:46.840> that's<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.349> answer

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
128 radical 3 right so that's the answer

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.089 
128 radical 3 right so that's the answer
