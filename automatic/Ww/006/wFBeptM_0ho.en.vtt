 pages 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.529
 well today I'm going to make orange air what 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.420
 try to show your orange the 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 Sistine soya and water 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.320
 to make the orange air we go to a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 container high and wide we are going to catch 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.840
 catch an orange juice the strained and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 clean all the impurities at once and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.340
 now we miss that container in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.860
 this case we are going to the same amount of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 juice than water because there was only 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.820
 I would add a meat and I do not think I would 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.449
 is too strong is also worth 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.410
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410
 soy lecithin 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.390
 we add and at the beginning we're going to beat 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.949
 average speed with the mouth of the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.949
 crusher in the background 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.510
 why 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.510
 I 'm going with the ingredients 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 once the neighbor with the orange and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 Water 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 it has dissolved we start to foam 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.570
 as we tilt the blender a little bit and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
 we add air 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.530
 from above 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.659
 also like this 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.090
 until a foam is formed by the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.369
 surface 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.030
 the function that the soybean office has 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.030
 in these recipes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.700
 as you see after having beaten it 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 there's been a lot of foam 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.380
 consistent we just take 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 if you try it 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.210
 and that a foam with orange flavor 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.450
 truth is very good now we are going to 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.489
 proceed to the presentation of the plate 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.720
 As you can see we have taken a plate 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.569
 we have done a bit of zest 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.640
 orange and two teaspoons and nothing if 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.250
 we have orange flavored foam or 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.430
 also called orange air I hope 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.430
 I wish you like it
