 hello this is the overflow and in the video today some tips on how to wrap gifts 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.000
 in a simple and creative way. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:47.510
 the materials of this video are kraft paper, laminated paper, scissors, stickers, string, double-sided tape, alphabet ruler, 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 crayons and crayons 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 to leave the finish better I use double-sided tape, instead of durex. 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 I used four interleaved paper ribbons to embellish and also pasted with double-sided tape 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 for this gift I used laminated paper, which you find in any stationery as 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 school article. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 to spruce I used these ball stickers, 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 which are sold to close invitation envelope. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.780
 and another string to tie and ready. 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.080
 and to facilitate you can cut several small pieces of double-sided tape before 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.080
 to start wrapping the present 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.440
 I used the alphabet rule to customize the gift, you can write the name of the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.440
 person or a message. 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.710
 as it was a child's gift, I put wax chalk so she could have fun 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.710
 also with the gift wrapping. 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.720
 In this one I used the technique of video, envelope folding. 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.080
 to decorate this I used these stars in origami and pasted with double-sided tape. 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:59.150
 this child's slate I used a simple paper and the pompom of tissue paper to decorate. 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:22.069
