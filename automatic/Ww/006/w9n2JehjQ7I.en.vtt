it's<00:00:11.320> been<00:00:11.500> a<00:00:11.530> year<00:00:11.590> since<00:00:11.980> we<00:00:12.129> last<00:00:12.160> talked

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
it's been a year since we last talked

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.220 
it's been a year since we last talked
about<00:00:12.759> game<00:00:12.969> compulsion<00:00:13.330> I<00:00:13.599> think<00:00:13.990> it's<00:00:14.080> time

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
about game compulsion I think it's time

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.260 
about game compulsion I think it's time
we<00:00:14.289> look<00:00:14.530> at<00:00:14.650> it<00:00:14.769> again<00:00:14.980> in<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.730> last<00:00:15.879> year<00:00:16.240> a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
we look at it again in the last year a

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.700 
we look at it again in the last year a
number<00:00:16.600> of<00:00:16.690> you<00:00:16.810> have<00:00:16.930> written<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.289> us<00:00:17.350> talking

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
number of you have written to us talking

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.650 
number of you have written to us talking
about<00:00:17.860> your<00:00:18.130> own<00:00:18.250> experiences<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.150> James<00:00:19.510> has

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
about your own experiences and James has

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.269 
about your own experiences and James has
had<00:00:19.750> several<00:00:20.050> people<00:00:20.439> both<00:00:20.740> friends<00:00:21.160> and

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
had several people both friends and

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.009 
had several people both friends and
students<00:00:21.730> asked<00:00:21.910> for<00:00:22.269> help<00:00:22.449> getting<00:00:22.599> back<00:00:22.750> to

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
students asked for help getting back to

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.630 
students asked for help getting back to
the<00:00:23.109> world<00:00:23.289> we've<00:00:23.800> learned<00:00:24.039> a<00:00:24.160> lot<00:00:24.279> from<00:00:24.340> these

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
the world we've learned a lot from these

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.040 
the world we've learned a lot from these
interactions<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.359> I<00:00:25.570> think<00:00:25.750> it's<00:00:25.869> time<00:00:26.019> we

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
interactions and I think it's time we

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.509 
interactions and I think it's time we
talk<00:00:26.320> about<00:00:26.439> what<00:00:26.769> we<00:00:26.859> think<00:00:27.099> are<00:00:27.220> some<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.429> the

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
talk about what we think are some of the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.160 
talk about what we think are some of the
root<00:00:27.699> causes<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.359> compulsion<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:29.019> many

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
root causes of the compulsion that many

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.749 
root causes of the compulsion that many
of<00:00:29.289> us<00:00:29.349> wrestle<00:00:29.710> with<00:00:29.859> because<00:00:30.339> the<00:00:30.490> more<00:00:30.640> we

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
of us wrestle with because the more we

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.249 
of us wrestle with because the more we
learn<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:30.970> more<00:00:31.240> we<00:00:31.480> realize<00:00:31.839> that<00:00:32.050> there's<00:00:32.200> a

learn the more we realize that there's a

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.590 
learn the more we realize that there's a
larger<00:00:32.650> issue<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:33.100> sense<00:00:33.490> of<00:00:33.640> being<00:00:34.000> lost<00:00:34.300> a

I<00:00:37.840> believe<00:00:38.379> that<00:00:38.559> game<00:00:38.710> compulsion<00:00:39.129> is<00:00:39.370> the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
I believe that game compulsion is the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.950 
I believe that game compulsion is the
result<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.850> many<00:00:40.000> things<00:00:40.300> but<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.629> thing<00:00:40.840> I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
result of many things but the thing I

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.689 
result of many things but the thing I

rarely hear all the studies talk about

rarely hear all the studies talk about
