go ahead and open up the utility as you
guys<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.040> it's<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> different

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
guys can see and it's all in a different

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
guys can see and it's all in a different
language<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> can't<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
language so you can't really you know

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
language so you can't really you know
understand<00:01:40.680> exactly<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> says<00:01:41.850> just

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
understand exactly what it says just

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
understand exactly what it says just
make<00:01:42.210> sure<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> does<00:01:42.930> detect<00:01:43.409> your

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
make sure that it does detect your

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.810 
make sure that it does detect your
device<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.009> guys<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.579> right<00:01:44.790> there

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
device as you guys can see right there

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
device as you guys can see right there
make<00:01:45.630> sure<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> detects<00:01:46.380> your<00:01:46.530> device

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
make sure that it detects your device

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
make sure that it detects your device
and<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:47.939> box<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and then there's this little box so you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
and then there's this little box so you
can<00:01:48.479> uncheck<00:01:49.340> uncheck<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> box<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
can uncheck uncheck that box because it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.420 
can uncheck uncheck that box because it
will<00:01:51.380> install<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.680> bunch<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> crap<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
will install a bunch of crap that you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
will install a bunch of crap that you
probably<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.180> device<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
probably don't want on your device so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
probably don't want on your device so
then<00:01:55.530> once<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.219> done<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.659> can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.170 
an open springboard page as you guys can
see<00:02:47.480> there<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.590> Pangu<00:02:49.040> application<00:02:50.030> right

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
see there is the Pangu application right

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.670 
see there is the Pangu application right
there<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.569> go<00:02:50.630> ahead<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.840> open<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.500> up

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
there we can go ahead and open this up

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.490 
there we can go ahead and open this up
and<00:02:51.890> like<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.850> said<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.480> does<00:02:53.750> not<00:02:54.050> install

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and like I said this does not install

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.710 
and like I said this does not install
Cydia<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.550> basically<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.150> device<00:02:56.420> is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
Cydia so basically your device is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.890 
Cydia so basically your device is
jailbroken<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.010> are<00:02:58.370> allowed<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.780> know

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
to access the file systems via SSH again

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.080 
to access the file systems via SSH again
there's<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.220> no<00:03:04.400> Cydia<00:03:04.819> there's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
there's going to be no Cydia there's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.270 
there's going to be no Cydia there's
nothing<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.569> do<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.200> point<00:03:06.319> you

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
nothing you can do at this point you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.330

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
will have to install Cydia manually and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.430
