00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
think it's just a poem that I wrote for

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.609 
think it's just a poem that I wrote for
my<00:01:02.829> grandma<00:01:03.340> Mary<00:01:03.460> whenever<00:01:03.880> she<00:01:04.089> passed<00:01:04.300> away

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
my grandma Mary whenever she passed away

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.870 
my grandma Mary whenever she passed away
so<00:01:05.619> we<00:01:05.770> hung<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.070> up<00:01:06.130> there<00:01:06.460> because<00:01:06.700> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
so we hung that up there because it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.710 
so we hung that up there because it
looks<00:01:06.910> perfect

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
looks perfect

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.230 
looks perfect
we<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.470> have<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:09.040> lot<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.490> natural<00:01:09.940> colors

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
we just have a lot of natural colors

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.580

going on in here

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.830
