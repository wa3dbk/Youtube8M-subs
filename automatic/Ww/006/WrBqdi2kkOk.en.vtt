this<00:01:24.270> car<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.659> actually<00:01:24.810> capable<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.500> given

this car is actually capable of given

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.789 
this car is actually capable of given
that<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.549> 1.6<00:01:27.210> liter<00:01:27.390> motor<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.960> produces

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that this 1.6 liter motor is produces

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.910 
that this 1.6 liter motor is produces
about<00:01:28.950> 120<00:01:29.579> horsepower<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:31.500> quite

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
about 120 horsepower and is quite

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.749 
about 120 horsepower and is quite
sprightly<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.790> nature<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.770> reason<00:01:35.130> why<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
sprightly in nature the reason why the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
sprightly in nature the reason why the
handling<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> mark<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
handling is not up to the mark is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
handling is not up to the mark is
because<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> suspension<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> softer

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
because the suspension is on the softer

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
because the suspension is on the softer
side<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> good<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.409> ride<00:01:40.560> quality<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
side so it is good for ride quality but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
side so it is good for ride quality but
not<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.880> overall<00:01:42.210> dynamics<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.979> engine

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
not good for overall dynamics the engine

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
not good for overall dynamics the engine
like<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.700> mentioned<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> quite<00:01:46.049> sprightly

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
like I just mentioned is quite sprightly

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.880 
like I just mentioned is quite sprightly
by<00:01:46.619> nature<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> hit<00:01:48.600> 0<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> 100<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.470> about

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
by nature you can hit 0 to 100 in about

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
by nature you can hit 0 to 100 in about
11<00:01:50.220> seconds<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.970> goes<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> top<00:01:51.750> speed

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
11 seconds and it goes on to a top speed

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.740 
11 seconds and it goes on to a top speed
just<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.670> shot<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> 190<00:01:54.390> km/h

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
just a little shot of 190 km/h

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.620 
just a little shot of 190 km/h
the<00:01:56.500> car<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.860> reasonably<00:01:57.340> fuel-efficient<00:01:58.180> we

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
the car is reasonably fuel-efficient we

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.140 
the car is reasonably fuel-efficient we
got<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.900> figure<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.320> about<00:01:59.410> 11<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.040> 11.5<00:02:00.670> kpl

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
got a figure of about 11 to 11.5 kpl

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.790 
got a figure of about 11 to 11.5 kpl
overall<00:02:01.510> which<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.080> not<00:02:02.230> too<00:02:02.380> bad

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
overall which is not too bad

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.460
