00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello my name is niclas schmidt 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.629
 and on this dvd you want the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.150
 main tactical motives nearby 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 to introduce defense 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.849
 many of these motives become theirs 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.660
 probably already known to be 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.619
 example that quality at top price 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.480
 one of the best known and most frequent on 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.269
 basking in the social city 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.609
 at all but I think that many 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 may not motivate like that yet 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 are known and my goal on this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.260
 dvd is it to show him when this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.180
 victims are attached and how to get it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.550
 prepared and which criteria met 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 have to be 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.020
 and I structured it that way 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.050
 Of course sacrifice for white and sacrifice for 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.329
 black and with every sacrifice I have yes 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.960
 First of all, a sample game where I am 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.570
 to introduce the tatmotiv europe 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.579
 and then there are several 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.230
 Examples 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 Practical examples where you yourself 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.079
 asked where you own the best trains 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 need to find 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.600
 he is an interactive dvd which means 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.549
 that they themselves work a lot 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.070
 have to 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.229
 Normally it's always the case with dvds 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 Viewed one allows to sprinkle and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.409
 can be very passive then but at this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.570
 it is active on this dvd that me 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.320
 important that they become active themselves 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.630
 I suppose I hope that you have money 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 for this dvd have spent by therefore 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 probably get the maximum out 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.000
 They really want to and do 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 best if you try yourself 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.930
 to solve the problem and problems 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 to solve 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 and I know it even from myself to 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.890
 solve any tasks or n-tv de 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.070
 Do not look very fast then 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.299
 to say yes here that she's good at that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.220
 will work out somehow playing 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 easy, but I'll beat it 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 in fact, that they imagine 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.469
 they would actually be a partie 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.640
 play and there would have to ask 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.290
 I really dare this now 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.439
 victim to play by that really in 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.800
 play a real tournament game 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.780
 and so maybe about 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.350
 then suddenly imagine in one 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.760
 competition 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 to be nation and both I gave up 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.110
 I'll say it later 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.250
 that if I say it is absolutely maximum 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.480
 and if they want to get out 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.010
 maybe have a little more time 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.930
 then I would even suggest that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.550
 they get a board out of it all 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.370
 Build up to rest 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.140
 this sets the competitive situation 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.810
 simulate and then try the office too 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.950
 that would be the best 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.460
 could know 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.800
 yes i believe so much of us we can 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.540
 then start directly and I wish 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.540
 Have fun with this dvd
