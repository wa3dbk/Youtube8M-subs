hawk<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.959> think<00:03:06.319> people<00:03:06.950> will<00:03:07.069> stop<00:03:07.430> playing

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.140 
hawk so I think people will stop playing
stock<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.230> level<00:03:09.560> cap<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.920> too<00:03:10.100> low<00:03:10.340> so

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
stock it's the level cap is too low so

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.900 
stock it's the level cap is too low so
what<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.690> believe<00:03:12.049> they<00:03:12.829> should<00:03:12.890> do<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.459> make<00:03:13.880> a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
what I believe they should do is make a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.560 
what I believe they should do is make a
 system<00:03:15.019> liking<00:03:15.380> call<00:03:16.250> duty<00:03:16.519> or<00:03:16.910> make

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
 system liking call duty or make

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.349 
 system liking call duty or make
