00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
what I mean by pan travel is once you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.010

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
gets to a level position that pan should

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.350 
gets to a level position that pan should
not<00:01:36.380> be<00:01:36.500> able<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:36.680> travel<00:01:36.950> below<00:01:37.400> level<00:01:38.060> like

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
to move the trap frame a little bit this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.130 
to move the trap frame a little bit this
way<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.370> will<00:02:34.520> pull<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.940> dog<00:02:35.240> further

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
way and that will pull that dog further

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.530 
way and that will pull that dog further
out<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.580> pan<00:02:37.880> drops<00:02:38.270> down

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
out so that when that pan drops down

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.020 
out so that when that pan drops down
below<00:02:38.900> level<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.680> will<00:02:39.830> go<00:02:39.980> off<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.850> we're<00:02:41.000> just

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
below level it will go off so we're just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
below level it will go off so we're just
going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.270> put<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:41.810> here<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.290> we're

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
going to put this in here and we're

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220 
going to put this in here and we're
going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.490> give<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.300> bit<00:02:44.480> about

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
going to give it just a little bit about

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.860 
going to give it just a little bit about
tweak<00:02:45.620> not<00:02:46.460> much<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.790> all<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.780> we're

tweak not much at all and then we're

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.500 
tweak not much at all and then we're
going<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.020> double<00:02:48.290> check<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:49.270> so<00:02:50.270> we'll<00:02:50.420> open

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510

all we really want is for that trap pan
to<00:03:00.800> go<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> level<00:03:01.930> once<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.110> level<00:03:04.000> that's

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
to go to level once it's level that's

that is we'll put earth anchors in the
ground<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.260> certain<00:03:27.500> locations<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.310> know

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
ground in certain locations that I know

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.850 
ground in certain locations that I know
are<00:03:28.730> key<00:03:28.940> set<00:03:29.209> locations<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.590> we'll<00:03:30.739> use

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
are key set locations and then we'll use

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.220 
are key set locations and then we'll use
a<00:03:30.890> quick<00:03:31.250> link<00:03:31.489> like<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.880> D<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> screw<00:03:33.050> on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
a quick link like this D with a screw on

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.160 
a quick link like this D with a screw on
it<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:33.680> can<00:03:33.830> just<00:03:34.010> screw<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
it that we can just screw on to the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.600 
it that we can just screw on to the
earth<00:03:36.200> anchor<00:03:36.650> loop<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.040> then<00:03:37.130> screwed<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
earth anchor loop and then screwed on to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.220 
earth anchor loop and then screwed on to
the<00:03:37.700> trap<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.630> let<00:03:38.720> me<00:03:38.810> show<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.140> real

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
the trap so let me show you that real

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.140 
the trap so let me show you that real
quick<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.770> what<00:03:45.950> I've<00:03:46.070> got<00:03:46.340> here<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.640> I've<00:03:46.910> got

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
quick so what I've got here is I've got

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.009 
quick so what I've got here is I've got
this<00:03:48.100> link<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.480> hook<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.750> link

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
this link and I can just hook that link

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.610 
this link and I can just hook that link
into<00:03:51.320> my<00:03:51.470> earth<00:03:51.590> anchor<00:03:53.050> hook<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.200> piece<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.530> my

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
into my earth anchor hook a piece of my

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.890 
into my earth anchor hook a piece of my
trap<00:03:54.890> chain<00:03:55.130> into<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.519> link<00:03:55.820> or<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.600> loop

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
trap chain into that link or this loop

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.949 
trap chain into that link or this loop
it<00:03:57.050> doesn't<00:03:57.290> really<00:03:57.380> matter

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
it doesn't really matter

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.570 
it doesn't really matter
tighten<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.050> quick<00:04:00.320> snap<00:04:00.590> went<00:04:00.860> down<00:04:01.100> and

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
tighten that quick snap went down and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.509 
tighten that quick snap went down and
now<00:04:02.120> I'm<00:04:02.540> set<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.620> I've<00:04:03.709> got<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:03.890> new<00:04:04.040> trap<00:04:04.340> in

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
now I'm set and I've got a new trap in

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.220 
now I'm set and I've got a new trap in
there<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.209> get<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.570> trap<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:05.959> gets

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
there so if I get a trap that gets

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.690 
there so if I get a trap that gets
messed<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.709> or<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:06.920> get<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.070> trap<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.430> gets<00:04:07.580> all

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
messed up or I get a trap that gets all

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.310 
messed up or I get a trap that gets all
bloody<00:04:08.060> or<00:04:08.570> something<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.019> that
