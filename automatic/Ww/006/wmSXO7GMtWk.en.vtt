 the idea of ​​ice skating in 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.770
 boost a skating rink on 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.860
 ice here in Lima was born to see that others 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.040
 countries and their main capitals this 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.000
 they have a track and we had no 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 we could stay behind 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.580
 the lack of experience will no longer be 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.770
 excuse not put on skates and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.990
 try to take a few steps in the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.899
 This is how the instructor explains it 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.520
 main definitely when one already 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.789
 has a basic knowledge about 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.039
 wheels is the base to be able to 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.960
 start ice skating 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.049
 but definitely us 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.030
 We need someone to guide us 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.740
 special technique and it's a learning 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 gradual and progressive as in any 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.830
 another sport from when before doing 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.380
 when ice skating practices 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.330
 in the little one I have been practicing this 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 but in the jockey it's been a while since 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.220
 I come is the first day after years 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 Well, it came once here and it's not that 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.850
 the practice but if I come to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.850
 have fun with your friends 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.730
 I am practicing first 5 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.629
 some young people already see this sport 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.030
 artistic as a passion and invest 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.689
 Long hours on the track to learn 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.430
 various routines they show us a 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.430
 little security with two machines 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.409
 the skating itself I practice it already go 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.900
 to be 30 years old I for you not since 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.090
 It was too small to start with the theme 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 of skating on wheels and then we went 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.379
 changing a bit in some trips to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 I had the opportunity to participate in 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.700
 ice skating and little by little I went 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.349
 introducing more to this sport and little 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.859
 little by little I got better at the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.859
 discipline 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.110
 you learn more dedication and effort if you 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.150
 You may see difficult at the beginning but 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.810
 when one practices often, more is done 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 easy learning 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.180
 the public also knows that falls and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.180
 blows are parts of this experience 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.569
 ice lampard also offers classes for 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.239

 how to get up well from a fall 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.380
 with fall and everything we see that skating 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.010
 on ice is not as complicated as 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.010
 It seems 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.870
