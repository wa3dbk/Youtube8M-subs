00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just quit and keep hitting test run and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.230 
just quit and keep hitting test run and
it<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.030> start<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:25.760> and<00:01:26.760> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.910> get<00:01:27.120> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
too competitively but what I liked about

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.430 
too competitively but what I liked about
this<00:01:44.190> game<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.790> war<00:01:45.450> factor<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.260> my

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
this game was the war factor in my

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.760 
this game was the war factor in my
opinion<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.100> best<00:01:47.190> I've<00:01:47.640> seen<00:01:48.770> I've

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770

played a lot of the newer games and I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.640 
played a lot of the newer games and I
just<00:01:52.020> didn't<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.390> strategy<00:01:54.390> war<00:01:54.870> here's

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650

just didn't like the strategy war here's
my<00:01:55.800> computer<00:01:56.190> getting<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.400> little<00:01:56.520> lag<00:01:56.790> down

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
my computer getting a little lag down

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.510 
my computer getting a little lag down
and<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.440> my<00:01:58.710> computer<00:01:58.950> my

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and it's really not my computer my

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.270 
and it's really not my computer my
computer<00:01:59.550> can<00:02:00.030> take<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.900> lot<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.470> newer

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
computer can take a lot of the newer

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.790 
computer can take a lot of the newer
games<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:03.630> something<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.260> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> code

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
games it's something to do with the code

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.109 
games it's something to do with the code
in<00:02:04.830> this

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
in this

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.960 
in this
adding<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.150> lot<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.299> rays<00:02:07.750> or<00:02:08.229> whistling<00:02:08.979> but<00:02:09.280> it

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
adding a lot of rays or whistling but it

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.680 
adding a lot of rays or whistling but it
just<00:02:10.240> massively<00:02:11.110> long<00:02:11.410> knocks<00:02:11.920> down<00:02:12.190> anything

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just massively long knocks down anything

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.339 
just massively long knocks down anything
it<00:02:13.690> doesn't<00:02:13.870> matter

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.140 

get<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.189> faster<00:02:18.609> servers

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
get up the faster servers

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.800 
get up the faster servers
is<00:02:20.209> going<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.510> be<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:23.540> thing<00:02:23.780> about

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
is going to be like this the thing about

this game now I'd loved this game
walking<00:02:26.360> often<00:02:26.930> online<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.459> got

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
walking often online is that it's got

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.369 
walking often online is that it's got
that<00:02:28.939> whole<00:02:29.590> network<00:02:30.590> code<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.110> now<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.260> is

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
that whole network code and now it is

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.880 
that whole network code and now it is
logical<00:02:33.650> off<00:02:33.980> route<00:02:34.310> errs<00:02:34.519> at<00:02:34.790> home<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.590> you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
logical off route errs at home and you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.979 
logical off route errs at home and you
have<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.129> add<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:37.400> EMT<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.209> plus<00:02:38.810> some

pyres<00:05:00.210> -<00:05:00.419> they<00:05:00.539> changed<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:00.990> much<00:05:01.199> stuff<00:05:01.470> that

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
pyres - they changed so much stuff that

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.399 
pyres - they changed so much stuff that
just<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.580> didn't<00:05:03.090> leave<00:05:03.360> me<00:05:03.599> with<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.050> same

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
just it didn't leave me with that same

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.860 
just it didn't leave me with that same
feeling<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.430> an<00:05:05.669> offensive<00:05:06.360> game<00:05:06.569> you're

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
feeling this is an offensive game you're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.180 
feeling this is an offensive game you're
supposed<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.229> attack<00:05:07.560> more<00:05:08.550> than<00:05:08.610> defend<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
supposed to attack more than defend and

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.710 
supposed to attack more than defend and
I<00:05:11.250> really<00:05:11.550> don't<00:05:11.669> like<00:05:11.849> those<00:05:12.000> catapults<00:05:12.569> when

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
I really don't like those catapults when

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.450 
I really don't like those catapults when
people<00:05:12.960> get<00:05:13.139> them<00:05:13.229> but<00:05:13.409> you<00:05:13.560> know<00:05:13.680> this<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
people get them but you know this is the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.140 
people get them but you know this is the
legions<00:05:14.789> floor<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.120> guess<00:05:15.330> they<00:05:16.940> bring<00:05:17.940> all

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
legions floor I guess they bring all

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.680 
legions floor I guess they bring all
those<00:05:18.330> units<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:19.639> got<00:05:20.639> pretty<00:05:20.879> ticked<00:05:21.240> off<00:05:21.449> when

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
those units I got pretty ticked off when

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.879 
those units I got pretty ticked off when
I<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:21.900> playing<00:05:22.169> this<00:05:22.319> a<00:05:22.380> couple<00:05:22.680> times

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
I was playing this a couple times

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.279 
I was playing this a couple times
through<00:05:23.419> reason<00:05:24.419> being<00:05:24.569> because<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:25.080> didn't

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
through reason being because I didn't

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.960 
through reason being because I didn't
have<00:05:25.409> enough<00:05:25.590> units<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.009> take<00:05:26.220> those<00:05:26.430> towers

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
have enough units to take those towers

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.960 
have enough units to take those towers
