00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to ligerz easy 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.970
 kitchen today like ham mozzarella 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:15.509
 from the ladberger four women we 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:18.390
 in the future 90 grams of mozzarella 20 grams 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.869
 ham I have to ham myself 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.600
 Taken 80 grams of tomato you can 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.939
 I take normal big formats 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.140
 but the colorful little tomatoes because of that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 I have the weight and something 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 chives 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.160
 many are in need of salad 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 a lot so once olive oil balsamic 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.390
 dressing 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 if someone believes in something sweet 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 stevia or some sugar salt and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.300
 I already have pepper in the Saarland 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 washed 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.430
 Now I'll show you how to do such a thing 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 such makes ham in the piece 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:08.060
 the whole thing is converted here then 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.500
 Let's take chive and tie that 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.510
 together 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 I already have our German 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.369
 prepared as they look 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.409
 I have training for two teaspoons 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.020
 balsamic vinegar and a teaspoon 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.030
 olive oil and a little thicker 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 mixed together and I do that now 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:41.180
 about the salad over it we can now 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.180
 the whole michelle 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:51.890
 the level sometimes not so good 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:58.850
 I 'll take my hands when pulling 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 the salad a little at this time no 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:07.540
 already the tomatoes cut this fair 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.020
 It would not like to have the tomato knife 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.020
 it's much faster 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.620
 Of course that does not take long 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.780
 snip and take the salad wash 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.380
 even a few minutes away but stop 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.980
 not so long then I'm going to mine 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.060
 mozzarella then come then come 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.060
 tomatoes on it 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:25.860
 and like some basil and leaflets 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.860
 already finished is good appetite 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.269
