00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.700
 since I like the power of my weight has been very reluctant network layouts 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 Associations I tried the Jucker name from Dark Knight with scars 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.829
 Represent plasticine 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.149
 I have documented the individual steps for you 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.900
 In the first step 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.740
 yes that's the canvas b Wettstein few kinds of plasticine with your fingers 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.239
 placed next to the corners of the mouth and smoothed out 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.229
 where some more plasticine has been applied, you can already see a few 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.229
 nice phone 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.089
 then with the spatula a little more space is carried up 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 pulled out nicely smooth again and the cut was frayed a little bit 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.350
 who has this name 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.370
 and every German wearing this place honors Dix for longer 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.700
 or La Text also that Platini give 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.519
 Fulda with 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.570
 they have really kept their shape 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 then you really do not forgo it 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.920
 Following rarely performed with Aqua make-up white primed 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.150
 It would be best for him a sponge or fingers that it is at this 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 Do not really care how neat it is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.070
 in the next step 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 but then gets him something deep by initially offered once made 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 some black contours then reinforce the impression of depth 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 Actually, I wanted to put an end to it just to design the names I have 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.860
 But then you want to make up the whole face 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.789
 So the far right now comes and the eyes are closed 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.809
 I have some strokes with the vegetables immediately Wallander later 

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.020
 Bella later best 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.600
 I fingered a few loaves of color around the hubs with my fingers 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 made there to prepare for later blurring 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.730
 I did not like the forehead wrinkles, so I asked them again 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.080
 gutted and primed white again 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.310
 rehabilitates something tricky so that the negative trend does not wash out effect 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.970
 gets 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.430
 the face is briefly sprayed with water 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.570
 either you spritz a bit with the hands in the face and 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.069
 one takes a partner or is such a pistol for blood 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.959
 and then dry with the help of a film before the aqua make-up really does 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.239
 starts to run 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.429
 Ennity work appeared depressed 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.069
 For the forehead wrinkles, just open the eyes wide with some of the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.029
 Developing wrinkles with a fine brush can only take a lot of water 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.559
 very little black 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.559
 this will result in a more natural wrinkle distribution 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.329
 I was partial to parts might have liked one more 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.809
 TÃ¼rker alternative viewed 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.139
 I wish you a great weekend and a 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:41.939
 Happy Halloween
