00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.790
 owl owl club slave 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.639
 so let's talk a little about the car for 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.929
 championship formula f is gorgeous 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.610
 technical invention 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.290
 and we are very happy to participate in this 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.000
 championship as it represents 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.170
 platform for new technology 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.930
 breakthrough 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.369
 what is special about this car before 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.980
 itâ€™s all completely electric 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 racing car and this is serious 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.630
 racing car it accelerates from 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.220
 zero to hundred in less than 3 seconds on 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 racing tires pilot or 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.270
 this is a very fast car 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.410
 maximum speed of about two hundred 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.930
 forty kilometers per hour 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.090
 the car is equipped with an electric motor whose 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.250
 area at the base you can tell the shadow 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.989
 that swing this motor size 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.039
 about a piece of paper which you 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.379
 you insert into the printer 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.629
 it rotates at a speed of 20 thousand 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.270
 rpm develops power in 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.789
 270 horsepower at maximum 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.949
 battery mode in one word 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.809
 the car just flies especially in urban 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.090
 conditions in which will be held 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.920
 race highway completely carbon 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.420
 fiber manufactured by the dollar company 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 has a relatively small 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 aerodynamic drag 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.890
 moderate tire downforce is near 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.150
 in size to passenger car tires 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.950
 245 4018 on the front axle and 305 4018 on 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.360
 rear axle 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.310
 these tires work at relatively 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.480
 low pressure in hot condition 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 about 1.7 tank we can achieve this 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.590
 because it hurts give a moderate presser 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.090
 force and no powerful vertical loads 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.950
 that give other types of racing fois 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.180
 but at the same time for us it means 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.070
 what needs to be achieved 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 exceptional level of mechanical 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.960
 clutch tires and work with enough 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.300
 low pressure and it hurts gets 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.190
 extra advantage since he 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.870
 able to instantly take torque 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.730
 moment from the electric motor what 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.430
 comes from 0 and revolutions per minute 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.190
 so hurts shoots from the spot and 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 precisely reduced pressure and design 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.630
 Tires give this opportunity 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.280
 grab torque sore 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 produces very interesting 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.830
 futuristic sound 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.260
 do you hear the engine or can say 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.660
 motor you hear the gearbox and you 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.520
 actually hearing silence for the first time in 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 world racing series we really 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.120
 delighted with what we are 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.610
 participants of this event 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.200
 formulas e gives us the opportunity to derive 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.060
 electric cars on battery 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 power supplies and tires 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.030
 designed for them to the highest 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.380
 level 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.330
 it is in an urban environment with 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 landscaped areas for 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.560
 uses in which electrical 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.470
 cars were created need to see 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.360
 with your own eyes and this race and the race cars themselves 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 resembling spaceships for 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.390
 interplanetary travel they use 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.570
 the most advanced slain technology 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.570
 perfection
