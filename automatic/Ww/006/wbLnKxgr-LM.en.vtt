00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
leaf on a wall by mistake so this is how

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.469 
leaf on a wall by mistake so this is how
fast<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.770> break<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> don't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
fast they can break but if you don't
break<00:01:33.720> them<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.799> something

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
break them they should look something

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
there but it's quite okay so this is how

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340 
there but it's quite okay so this is how

video<00:01:54.119> i'll<00:01:54.600> add<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> description<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
video i'll add it in the description of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
video i'll add it in the description of
this<00:01:56.310> video<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.299> how<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> pseudo

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
this video so you can see how the pseudo

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
this video so you can see how the pseudo
bulbs<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.229> look<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.520> fully

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
bulbs will look like when they fully

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.810 
bulbs will look like when they fully
mature<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> summertime<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.369> keep<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
mature now in the summertime I keep this

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
mature now in the summertime I keep this
orchid<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> bright<00:02:03.600> location<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.350> no

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
orchid in a bright location but no

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.700 
orchid in a bright location but no
direct<00:02:05.520> Sun<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.320> burn<00:02:07.500> leaves

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
direct Sun because it can burn leaves

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.460 
direct Sun because it can burn leaves
pretty<00:02:08.340> pretty<00:02:08.700> fast<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.330> no<00:02:09.780> direct<00:02:10.259> Sun

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pretty pretty fast so no direct Sun

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.610 
pretty pretty fast so no direct Sun
quite<00:02:10.950> at<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.790> bright<00:02:12.209> low<00:02:12.989> key

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
quite at all just a bright low key

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770 
quite at all just a bright low key
I<00:02:13.650> water<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.189> as<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:15.030> media<00:02:15.299> approaches

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I water it as the media approaches

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.589 
I water it as the media approaches
dryness<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.500> don't<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.310> let<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.909> super

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
dryness I don't really let it go super

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.440 
dryness I don't really let it go super
dry<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.769> watering<00:02:20.220> day<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
dry right now it is watering day it is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
dry right now it is watering day it is
becoming<00:02:21.810> quite<00:02:22.049> dry<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:22.829> need<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.250> water

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
becoming quite dry so I need to water

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.420 
becoming quite dry so I need to water
this<00:02:23.700> orchid<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:25.140> fertilize<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:26.010> along

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this orchid and I fertilize it along

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
this orchid and I fertilize it along
with<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.790> other<00:02:27.000> orchids<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:27.840> about<00:02:28.079> every<00:02:28.379> two

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
with my other orchids so about every two

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.009 
with my other orchids so about every two
weeks<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.159> give<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.030> first<00:02:30.209> fertilized

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
weeks I give it the first fertilized

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
weeks I give it the first fertilized
water<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> use<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.159> my<00:02:32.370> other<00:02:32.670> orchids

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
water that I use with my other orchids

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.050 
water that I use with my other orchids
and<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:34.110> decided<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.680> keep<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:34.980> hanging<00:02:35.579> simply

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
and I decided to keep it hanging simply

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.089 
and I decided to keep it hanging simply
because<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:36.780> such<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.019> big<00:02:37.290> baby<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.950> it

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
because it is such a big baby that it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.670 
because it is such a big baby that it
takes<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.519> too<00:02:39.030> much<00:02:39.060> space<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.260> that's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
takes up too much space so that's that's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.339 
takes up too much space so that's that's
why<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> hanged<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.879> but<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.420> don't<00:02:42.629> have<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.200> do

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
why I hanged it but you don't have to do

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.750 
why I hanged it but you don't have to do
this<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.829> want<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:44.069> keep<00:02:44.189> it<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.579> pot

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
this if you want to keep it in the pot

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.089 
this if you want to keep it in the pot
and<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.390> space<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:46.680> keep<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
and you have the space you can keep it

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.000 
and you have the space you can keep it
in<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.310> pot<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.260> play<00:02:49.470> yoni<00:02:49.709> this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
in the pot so this is the play yoni this

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.339 
in the pot so this is the play yoni this
is<00:02:50.159> how<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.670> doing<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.629> think<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:52.049> doing

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
is how it's doing I think it's doing

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.759 
is how it's doing I think it's doing
quite<00:02:52.650> well<00:02:52.709> looks<00:02:53.430> quite<00:02:53.849> nice<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.590> yeah<00:02:55.590> I'm

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
quite well looks quite nice and yeah I'm

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.000 
quite well looks quite nice and yeah I'm
hoping<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.370> by<00:02:56.609> fall<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.409> new

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
hoping that by fall I will have a new

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.479 
hoping that by fall I will have a new
batch<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> nice<00:03:00.239> plump<00:03:00.780> pseudobulbs<00:03:01.620> also<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
batch of nice plump pseudobulbs also the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.520 
batch of nice plump pseudobulbs also the
roots<00:03:02.670> are<00:03:02.849> growing<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.450> crazy<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:04.200> circuit

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
roots are growing like crazy the circuit

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.979 
roots are growing like crazy the circuit
can<00:03:04.739> produce<00:03:04.950> new<00:03:05.340> growth<00:03:05.609> from<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.120> top<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.629> a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
can produce new growth from the top of a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.530 
can produce new growth from the top of a
pseudo<00:03:07.290> bulb<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.769> well<00:03:08.069> as<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:08.970> see<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
pseudo bulb as well as you can see the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.930 
pseudo bulb as well as you can see the
pseudo<00:03:10.079> bulbs<00:03:10.379> that<00:03:10.440> are<00:03:10.620> sprouting<00:03:11.430> now<00:03:11.609> from

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
pseudo bulbs that are sprouting now from

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.930 
pseudo bulbs that are sprouting now from
the<00:03:12.090> top<00:03:12.269> are<00:03:12.590> tinier<00:03:13.590> actually<00:03:14.370> than<00:03:14.909> the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the top are tinier actually than the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.689 
the top are tinier actually than the
ones<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.569> sprouted<00:03:15.959> from<00:03:16.379> one<00:03:16.590> side<00:03:16.950> so

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
ones that sprouted from one side so

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.530 
ones that sprouted from one side so
hopefully<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.180> see<00:03:18.329> here<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
hopefully you can see here this is the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.670 
hopefully you can see here this is the
difference<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.049> pseudo<00:03:22.349> bulb<00:03:22.470> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
difference this is a pseudo bulb that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.069 
difference this is a pseudo bulb that
came<00:03:22.949> from<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.459> side<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.150> these<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
came from one side and these are the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.990 
came from one side and these are the
pseudobulbs<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.709> come<00:03:25.889> from<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.220> top<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.849> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
pseudobulbs that come from the top of a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.970 
pseudobulbs that come from the top of a
pseudo<00:03:27.239> bulb<00:03:27.419> this<00:03:28.049> is<00:03:28.199> how<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.379> roots<00:03:28.739> look

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
pseudo bulb this is how the roots look

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.789 
pseudo bulb this is how the roots look
like<00:03:29.250> actually<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:29.849> pot<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.359> full<00:03:30.930> full<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
like actually the pot is full full of

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.640 
like actually the pot is full full of
these<00:03:32.010> roots<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.669> do<00:03:33.060> have<00:03:33.299> quite<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.049> big

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
these roots they do have quite a big

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.890 
these roots they do have quite a big
root<00:03:34.889> system<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:35.760> necessarily<00:03:36.419> very<00:03:36.569> long

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
root system not necessarily very long

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.390 
root system not necessarily very long
but<00:03:37.260> quite<00:03:38.359> extensive<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.829> yeah<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.069> is<00:03:41.129> how

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
but quite extensive and yeah this is how

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.759 
but quite extensive and yeah this is how
the<00:03:41.459> play<00:03:41.879> ona<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.180> doing<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.840> seems<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.680> an
