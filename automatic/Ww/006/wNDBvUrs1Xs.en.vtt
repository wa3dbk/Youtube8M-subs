00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.589
 well 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.710
 for me it's going really well and 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:21.280
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.090
 tutorial them how to film so that's going 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.910
 to be his ipad his iphone and his ipod 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 5 all this under es7 es8 personally 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.789
 I'm on ipad r our there is 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.309
 someone who told me in the aisne in 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.379
 the message that he could not do it for 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.239
 ipad r of water I'm going to show him 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.440
 how to do it and then if there is any 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.219
 others who are in the same case 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.399
 ben this tutorial surely help you so 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.839
 so to start it will have to be 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.819
 stall on safari and so I got myself 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.579
 put on google there for for sure you 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:00.999
 show you are going all you are going to type 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.270
 and moved for ios 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:09.150
 that's how you go in the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.260
 first and drill this point is concrete 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.930
 and there you will arrive on a page 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 like that so there you will arrive on 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.310
 the console joystick and you do 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.840
 install so I 've already installed 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.020
 make him cancel and there you do 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.290
 so install once that to do 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.740
 there after and it will settle down so 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.920
 you come back in the menu here is you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.710
 going to your icon but then so the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.330
 for you to see you see well and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.420
 there you have you have your icon 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.670
 so here it may be that in fact the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.370
 problem that is going to be is that when 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.680
 you're going m it's not going to charge so 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:57.490
 me it makes me me well 25 x 30 x and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.440
 a moment there is an update to us 8 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.420

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.760
 the holidays and I tried again after and there 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500
 it works and nokia so I do not know 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.180
 after you if it's going to work from the first 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.190
 that's it, you 're going to try it all again 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.720
 time and you try you tried to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.400
 reinstall to restart 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.740
 here everything is after a while it's okay 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.140
 well walk you wait the first 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.830
 the next update is 2 apple 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.560
 which often corrects the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.940
 the applications or is the update 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.410
 2 of this set this application what so 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.000
 you go on and that's it to you 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.030
 and there you have several tips from 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.290
 stuff that serves us a little nothing 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.150
 we what interested us it's going to be 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.830
 to hirak beta and cabbage cheek can be 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.170
 weird because it's not too well known yet 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.590
 so here's after you go click by 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.720
 example on at y is you do install 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 here and after that will load on your 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.420
 menu of your device and you do 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.610
 the same for which you want 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.459
 use and after you come on the last 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.170
 main after I showed you not a 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.790
 once that settle these two you 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.020
 choose one or two me 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.680
 personally and rich skirt or because 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.720
 that there 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.040
 I can record except that after this 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.959
 I can not put them in 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.060
 photos that may I do not know why 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.850
 so I prefer playing I know 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.970
 much more at a quality not too much 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.190
 disgusting and give up in super simple 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.220
 use 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.630
 here after you go in your settings 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.120
 you have in general accessibility 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.880
 you go down all the way down she attends 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.350
 assistive touch all the way down so the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.980
 third we start from hunger and 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.010
 made you activated this is the button that 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.989
 is that is essential to record 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.910
 your videos I do not know why it's 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.380
 who want to put it 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.320
 and here you go once that's me 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.760
 go in there you go as you 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.489
 have installed then the orientation video 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.769
 it depends me I read all that like that 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.420
 because he rejects me I do not use it 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.440
 so after if you want to put your 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.549
 apple button 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.729
 on the left it's left I think and at 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.560
 right it's wright 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.370
 So here I am going to leave 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.450
 f after you make cash 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.470
 you put to 30 that's bitrate you 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.080
 put to six thousand and one record audio that 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.600
 you put or not if you want it 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.610
 record your voice and we'll see you 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.930

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.530
 record your voice down you have to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.880
 activate like that now so now 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.240
 we will go to cabbage so there is less 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.000

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.380

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.780
 not because I'm trying 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.820
 to record with software 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.610

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.700

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.840
 your video no when you named 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.680
 your video for example the test number 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.560
 one and you will start the video so 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.150
