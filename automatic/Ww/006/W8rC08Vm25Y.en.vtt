 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.830
 weave bracelets like this without 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.830
 Fasteksov obtained purely from paracord 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:22.189
 Here I have here a few 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.949
 here are bracelets of different textures and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.460
 colors here somehow it will be all 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.460
 to look 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 need to push 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.960
 one 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.600
 here somehow so it will look what 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.760
 such type of weaving is good that fasteks 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.269
 may break sooner or later but here 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.649
 it will be forever and you can also leave 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:12.310
 little stock and when the hand will grow 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:17.600
 You can increase here all look like 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 you need to weave such bracelets and so you 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.679
 for this we need we need 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.299
 somewhere around 60 centimeters of paracord also 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.360
 we will need 3 meters of paracord if 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.560
 you want to make a bracelet of two colors 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.009
 you have to solder it like this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.009
 we also need scissors and 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.009
 lighter 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.900
 take a short pro court and do here 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.900
 such a loop 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.060
 we do it like a lock 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.160
 do not delay we just need to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.840
 adjust 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:14.020
 what is your wrist world i need 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.830
 16 centimeters she's about 17 to do 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.830
 to lock long 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.550
 asylum do not delay then you can 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.819
 adjust further means just peace 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.819
 here 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:46.390
 here is this record if you double then 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 put in the middle and start doing 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 coil 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.739
 turns on the bottom 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.670
 and we get black 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.739
 on top of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.730
 we need to follow in order not jumped 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.730
 small piece of paracord 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.370
 learn we just start doing ordinary 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.680
 cobra 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:38.350
 only in ordinary cabaret is all nonsense 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.350
 on fixed and here it turns out not 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.599
 keep it all right 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.819
 we need to leave instead of here 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.409
 what to thread this one 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.889
 some lock when pulling and now take 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:03.849
 here is this piece of this paracord and 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.599
 we pass through the bottom and continue to weave 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.599
 carpets 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.180
 this method is insane insanely convenient m order 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.710
 that Fasteks can break this one 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.710
 loop on the eternal 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.050
 on 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.130
 let's show you again 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:00.270
 green, take off then on top 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:06.790
 black and black and bolts here in this 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:09.570
 then this loop undertakings 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.920
 let's show it to us again 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.960
 regularity is that paracord which 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:22.740
 always sticking up this one we 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.740
 we get down and this wise him here 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.780
 I will disconnect and turn on as when 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.840
 will finish 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.320
 on the trail and show you how to finish it 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320
 solder 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.550
 here i'm done let's cut the tips and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.139
 for catching all the lighter 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.530
 that somehow we did it all 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.530
 it turns out 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.629
 so here it will all look on hand 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:38.699
 you can cut off these 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:41.250
 the tips make them shorter but they have 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.979
 some supporting role will be interrupted by 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.879
 hand on threaded put on IT 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:54.030
 tips and then with a lever like 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:58.460
 pull this lock and start up here 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.460
 this is a bundle here 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.470
 something like this all thanks for watching 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.470
 see you bye
