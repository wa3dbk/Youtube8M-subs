00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
all right so we're gonna take a look at

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.960 
all right so we're gonna take a look at
a<00:00:03.240> simple<00:00:03.659> way<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.810> replace<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.740> string<00:00:05.339> value

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
a simple way to replace a string value

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.970 
a simple way to replace a string value
inside<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.600> text<00:00:06.899> file<00:00:07.080> using<00:00:07.470> PowerShell

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
inside of a text file using PowerShell

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.040 
inside of a text file using PowerShell
so<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.910> file<00:00:09.179> here<00:00:09.480> called<00:00:09.510> garden

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
so I have this file here called garden

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.230 
so I have this file here called garden
dot<00:00:10.200> txt<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.920> planted<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.460> bunch<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.730> potatoes

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
dot txt I planted a bunch of potatoes

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.940 
dot txt I planted a bunch of potatoes
and<00:00:12.480> now<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.380> there's<00:00:13.710> onions

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and now I see that there's onions

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.799 
and now I see that there's onions
growing<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> guy<00:00:15.450> crossed

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
growing in it I think the guy crossed

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.330 
growing in it I think the guy crossed
the<00:00:15.960> street<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.470> planted<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.160> when<00:00:17.310> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the street when planted them when I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.519 
the street when planted them when I
wasn't<00:00:17.580> looking<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.539> whatever<00:00:18.690> reason<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
wasn't looking for whatever reason I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.200 
wasn't looking for whatever reason I
have<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.070> change<00:00:20.310> them<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:20.970> want

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
have to change them because I don't want

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
have to change them because I don't want
onions<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.840> we're<00:00:22.289> gonna<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.619> PowerShell

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
onions so we're gonna come to PowerShell

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
onions so we're gonna come to PowerShell
and<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.519> gonna<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.269> change<00:00:24.960> those

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and we're gonna use it to change those

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
and we're gonna use it to change those
onions<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> potatoes<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.210> first<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.660> need<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.799 
supply it the location of my garden and
then<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.230> pass<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.399> content<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
then I'm gonna pass the content of that

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
then I'm gonna pass the content of that
garden<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.440> an<00:00:38.040> object<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.030> each

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
garden as an object to the for each

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.709 
garden as an object to the for each
object<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.309> using<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.430> special<00:00:41.910> variable

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
object and using this special variable

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.020 
object and using this special variable
I'm<00:00:42.930> gonna<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.980> each<00:00:44.190> iterate<00:00:44.820> through

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I'm gonna have for each iterate through

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
I'm gonna have for each iterate through
each<00:00:45.239> line<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.020> object<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.190> using

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
each line of that object and then using

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.680 
each line of that object and then using
the<00:00:48.149> replace<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> search<00:00:50.910> for

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the replace I will have it search for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
the replace I will have it search for
these<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.949> string<00:00:53.309> value<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> replace<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
these this string value and replace it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
these this string value and replace it
with<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.710> string<00:00:56.100> value<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.390> see

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
with this string value so you can see

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
with this string value so you can see
they're<00:00:57.690> separated<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> comma<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.430> once

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
they're separated by a comma now once

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
they're separated by a comma now once
I've<00:01:00.120> changed<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.960> these<00:01:01.590> values<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I've changed all these values and it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.520 
I've changed all these values and it's
finished<00:01:02.910> iterating<00:01:03.539> through<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> file<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
finished iterating through that file I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000 
finished iterating through that file I
need<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.280> create<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.240> file<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.290> replace<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
need to create a file or replace the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
need to create a file or replace the
contents<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.909> original<00:01:09.360> file<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
contents of my original file but it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
contents of my original file but it's
always<00:01:10.170> good<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> test<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.130> stuff<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.670> first

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
always good to test this stuff out first

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.380 
always good to test this stuff out first
so<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.299> supplying<00:01:13.049> set<00:01:13.650> content<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.520> different

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so I'm supplying set content a different

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
so I'm supplying set content a different
file<00:01:15.630> name<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.770> using<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> force

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
file name and I'm using the force

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
file name and I'm using the force
because<00:01:17.869> well<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
because well I just like to use the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
because well I just like to use the
force<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.240> once<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.080> run<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:24.530> we<00:01:25.530> open<00:01:25.830> up

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
force so once we run this and we open up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
force so once we run this and we open up
clean<00:01:26.250> garden<00:01:26.670> you'll<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
clean garden you'll see that all of the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
clean garden you'll see that all of the
onions<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.220> been<00:01:29.369> replaced<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.850> potatoes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
onions have been replaced with potatoes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.910 
onions have been replaced with potatoes
which<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.259> great<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> big

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
which is great and it's not not a big

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
which is great and it's not not a big

bunch of fields and those fields are way

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
bunch of fields and those fields are way
bigger<00:01:47.820> than<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> garden<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.689> there's<00:01:49.200> lots<00:01:49.590> of

day<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.450> throwing<00:01:57.840> onions<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.500> garden<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
day just throwing onions in my garden I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.709 
day just throwing onions in my garden I
don't<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.369> what's<00:01:59.549> wrong<00:01:59.759> with<00:01:59.820> him<00:02:00.119> but

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
don't know what's wrong with him but

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.230 
don't know what's wrong with him but
either<00:02:00.930> way<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.380> got<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> replace<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
either way I got to replace them so I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
either way I got to replace them so I
can<00:02:04.049> use<00:02:04.170> PowerShell<00:02:04.530> again<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.369> need<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
can use PowerShell again I just need to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.839 
can use PowerShell again I just need to
add<00:02:05.759> another<00:02:06.329> loop<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.610> first

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
add another loop so like in the first

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.699 
add another loop so like in the first
example<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.810> were<00:02:09.959> looping<00:02:10.440> through

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
example where we were looping through

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.630 
example where we were looping through
each<00:02:11.009> line<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.840> that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
each line of that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.520 
each line of that
objects<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.090> case<00:02:15.299> we<00:02:15.540> need<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.720> create<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
objects in this case we need to create a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.039 
objects in this case we need to create a
new<00:02:16.769> object<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.580> contains<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
new object that contains all of the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.710 
new object that contains all of the
files<00:02:19.409> that<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.220> iterate<00:02:20.640> through<00:02:20.849> so

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
files that we want to iterate through so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720 
files that we want to iterate through so
what<00:02:22.080> we're<00:02:22.200> doing<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> we're<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.430> using

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
what we're doing here is we're now using

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.420 
what we're doing here is we're now using
get<00:02:24.480> child<00:02:24.840> item<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.830> same<00:02:26.040> way<00:02:26.220> we

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
get child item much in the same way we

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
get child item much in the same way we
use<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.819> get<00:02:27.000> content<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.780> get<00:02:28.019> child<00:02:28.379> item

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
use to get content and get child item

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.539 
use to get content and get child item
we'll<00:02:29.310> grab<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.390> files<00:02:31.159> inside<00:02:32.159> of

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
we'll grab all of the files inside of

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.300 
we'll grab all of the files inside of
the<00:02:33.000> folder<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:33.780> supply<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:35.040> I'm

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the folder that I supply it then I'm

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.369 
the folder that I supply it then I'm
sending<00:02:35.670> all<00:02:35.940> those<00:02:36.239> files<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.200> each

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
sending all those files to the for each

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.550 
sending all those files to the for each
object<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> once<00:02:38.849> again<00:02:39.170> we're<00:02:40.170> using<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
object and once again we're using the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.550 
object and once again we're using the
current<00:02:41.310> pipeline<00:02:41.730> item<00:02:42.269> variable<00:02:42.840> but

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
current pipeline item variable but

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
current pipeline item variable but
because<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.400> current<00:02:44.640> pipeline<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:45.299> item

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
because this current pipeline it item

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.309 
because this current pipeline it item
variable<00:02:46.230> represents<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.129> item<00:02:47.879> within<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.589 

file<00:02:52.319> list<00:02:52.739> object<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.670> has<00:02:53.910> different

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
file list object it has different

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.809 
file list object it has different
properties<00:02:54.870> from<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> file<00:02:55.890> list<00:02:56.160> object<00:02:56.640> so

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
properties from that file list object so

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.220 
properties from that file list object so
what<00:02:57.239> we<00:02:57.359> can<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.900> use<00:02:58.079> this<00:02:58.500> dot<00:02:59.099> full<00:02:59.430> name

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
what we can do is use this dot full name

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.780 
what we can do is use this dot full name
parameter<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.769> full<00:03:02.040> path<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
parameter to get the full path to the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.789 
parameter to get the full path to the
file<00:03:03.150> name<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.290> setting<00:03:04.560> this

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
file name so then I'm setting this

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.970 
file name so then I'm setting this
variable<00:03:05.549> with<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> full<00:03:06.420> path<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.500> file

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
variable with the full path to that file

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.520 
variable with the full path to that file
name<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.970> we're<00:03:09.150> looking<00:03:09.299> at<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:09.840> then

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
name that we're looking at and then

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
name that we're looking at and then
we're<00:03:10.920> using<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.400> same<00:03:11.640> code<00:03:11.909> that<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.239> used

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
we're using the same code that we used

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.479 
we're using the same code that we used
above<00:03:12.780> we're<00:03:13.590> taking<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.609> full<00:03:15.829> or<00:03:16.829> we're

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
above we're taking the full or we're

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.640 
above we're taking the full or we're
looking<00:03:17.639> at<00:03:17.910> content<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.630> after<00:03:19.470> we've

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
looking at content and after we've

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.849 
looking at content and after we've
gotten<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.040> content<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.540> file<00:03:22.019> we're

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
gotten the content of that file we're

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.159 
gotten the content of that file we're
passing<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:24.060> each<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.599> we're<00:03:25.079> doing

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
passing it to for each and we're doing

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.979 
passing it to for each and we're doing
the<00:03:25.650> same<00:03:25.760> same<00:03:26.760> structure<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:27.569> then<00:03:27.780> we're

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the same same structure here then we're

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.539 
the same same structure here then we're
setting<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.380> content<00:03:29.480> back<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.379> file<00:03:31.680> so

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
setting the content back to that file so

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.589 
setting the content back to that file so
it<00:03:32.879> iterates<00:03:33.769> once<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.069> grabs<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.970> first<00:03:36.180> file

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
it iterates once it grabs the first file

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.979 
it iterates once it grabs the first file
and<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:38.430> replaces<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.329> content<00:03:39.840> in

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
and then it replaces all the content in

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
and then it replaces all the content in
that<00:03:40.200> file<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.829> then<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.519> goes<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.730> gets<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
that file and then it goes and gets the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.720 
that file and then it goes and gets the
second<00:03:42.690> file<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.799> replaces<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
second file and then replaces the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.509 
second file and then replaces the
content<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> second<00:03:45.720> file<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.340> run

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
content in the second file so we can run

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.150 
content in the second file so we can run
this<00:03:47.699> now<00:03:47.940> let<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:48.989> comment<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:50.129> out<00:03:52.160> so

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
this now let me just comment this out so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.009 
this now let me just comment this out so
I've<00:03:53.280> run<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.669> now<00:03:53.910> let's<00:03:54.120> open<00:03:54.299> up<00:03:54.569> the

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
I've run that now let's open up the

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.170 
I've run that now let's open up the
field<00:03:55.319> again<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.329> as<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.359> can<00:03:57.750> see<00:03:58.459> all<00:03:59.459> of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
field again and as you can see all of

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.830 
field again and as you can see all of
the<00:04:00.870> onions<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.849> all<00:04:02.849> my<00:04:03.030> fields<00:04:03.329> have<00:04:03.690> been

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
the onions and all my fields have been

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.930 
the onions and all my fields have been
replaced<00:04:04.319> with<00:04:04.530> potatoes<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.760> how

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
replaced with potatoes so that is how

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.170 
replaced with potatoes so that is how
you<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:07.260> use<00:04:07.290> powershell<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.819> little<00:04:09.060> bit

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
you can use powershell and a little bit

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.479 
you can use powershell and a little bit
of<00:04:09.269> looping<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.930> change<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.530> string<00:04:10.739> value<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
of looping to change a string value in

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.509 
of looping to change a string value in
either<00:04:11.910> one<00:04:12.239> file<00:04:12.599> or<00:04:12.900> multiple<00:04:13.650> files<00:04:14.220> within

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
either one file or multiple files within

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.550 
either one file or multiple files within
a<00:04:14.699> directory<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:16.079> that's<00:04:16.229> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
a directory so that's it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.070 
a directory so that's it
