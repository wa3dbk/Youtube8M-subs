chick<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.610> feel<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.150> if<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.930> wore<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
right outfit I can rock it so it's this

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.410 
right outfit I can rock it so it's this
black<00:02:27.670> fox<00:02:28.670> fur<00:02:29.060> jacket<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.299> part<00:02:32.299> of<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
black fox fur jacket and part of the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.410 
black fox fur jacket and part of the
reason<00:02:32.450> why<00:02:32.690> buy<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.350> was<00:02:33.799> undecided<00:02:34.420> but

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
reason why buy it I was undecided but

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.900 
reason why buy it I was undecided but
the<00:02:35.600> price<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.870> twenty-five<00:02:36.290> dollars<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.519> i

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
the price is twenty-five dollars so i

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.550
