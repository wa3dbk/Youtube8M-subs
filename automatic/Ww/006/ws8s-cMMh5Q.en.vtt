00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.760

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.680
 the first one that appears 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.000
 it's going to look like this the first one I'm going to say 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.720
 can install 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.880
 and they will give 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.830
 I 'm going to upload the author's page 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.040
 the band of this green bar and they are already 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.110
 will start the upton download and good 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.860
 when they have already downloaded apt 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.829
 she is an apt idea 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.140
 and here they will look in the magnifying glass 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.170
 the name of the game 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.170
 what is resident evil alive 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.159
 but it is in 4 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.560
 good we will give you to look 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.560
 in other repositories 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.909
 well here I 'm going to load this 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.820
 in the in position number 5 will be 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.230
 the game that is to be here we are going to 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.100
 appear two images that will do 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:49.570
 almost the same but the first says 10.122 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.820
 downloads and the second says one thousand 401 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.760
 downloads when they're going to give the first 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.790
 who has loved more downloads grow 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.770
 Level 4 low ford and will install him 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.350
 says what operation you want to do 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.380
 save or open I will give to open 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.800
 in my case and you are going to say this in 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.880
 save the same thing, they will give you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.330
 execute and if you want to download it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.209
 or download it for if you want 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.970
 they install and they want to reinstall it 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.590
 to play it again one in this case 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.590
 I will give it to open or execute 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 and will ask them if they want to install it 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.750
 they will give it to accept well I will no longer 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.079
 I'm going to do it because I already have the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.049
 application the game 1 now very 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.400
 important those in those who already 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.349
 I have loaded the game 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.849
 at the beginning it will seem that 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.550
 they need to download the data 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.010
 traditional 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.470
 and they're going to tell you that if we take 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.110
 about three minutes needs to be 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.800
 connected to a wifi network when this is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.800
 the intro of the game 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.320
 well I 'm going to jump 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.930
 with a game is totally in English 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.599
 when these are the modes of history 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.599
 I'll give you the first 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.930
 will load the game 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.770
 Well, I'm going to show you some 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.450
 tips 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.970
 like this is the whole story the same 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.720
 I can read it because it's in English 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.720
 I'm going to jump all 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.480
 will teach us how to play what we 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.480
 we move with this we aim and shoot 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.890
 I'm far away you can not see it but 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.530
 there is a good zombie here in our 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.660
 from our left side our side 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.600
 top left is going to see a small 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.820
 as a map 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.720
 and something very important was right the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.790
 they are going to move towards this side 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.470
 like two three times and it's going to look like 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.760
 this 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.240
 here he doubles the coins of his 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.360
 stability many things do it for 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.830
 example is 5 and they will give you play 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.910
 when it is in English they will give you and 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.390
 that they stay like that in orange 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.920
 they can already when they see a zombie 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.020
 example this that is here point the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.880
 look and it will be blue and zombie 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.390
 it's going to be frozen and they can 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.390
 shoot him 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.659
 good this 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.650
 this is one day I also left the look 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.650
 it will stay in blue 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.469
 good 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.469
 Well, I think this has been all 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.620
 here is the scioli itself 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.170
 if it is to measure I do not aim and it 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.970
 it stays frozen it stays that way blue it 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.400
 freeze and we can shoot him in the 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.229
 face 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.330
 it does not matter anywhere on the body 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.259
 place by in is going to be the same as it is in 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.259
 the face of the chest 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:57.310
 Well, I think this has been all 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.310
 for today and if they grab 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.920
 I'm going to remove the stairs wait for me 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.320
 to teach them how 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.270
 what am I going to do good here 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.060
 like there we killed a zombie we are going to 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.969
 to be these things we're going to grab and 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.509
 it will be 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.939
 this bullets I guess they're going to 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.759
 multiply by 10 what we have just 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:25.489
 do the tips that I saw them for example 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:29.230
 this the coins if for example they are 100 

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:32.710
 they will multiply by 5 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.260
 and they already have more money and more things 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.340
 they will multiply and they will not die 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.470
 so easily 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.760
 when he looks at her and as I told you 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.630
 is going to put to freeze the zombies 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.630
 you n 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.440
 wilson and as a good medium 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.040
 Well, I think this has been all 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.180
 For today 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:15.789
 I hope you liked it. 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.789
 from lehman and it's up and subscribe 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.510
