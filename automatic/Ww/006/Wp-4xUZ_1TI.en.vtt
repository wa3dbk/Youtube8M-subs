00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it but you could lay a plastic wrap or

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.320 
it but you could lay a plastic wrap or
wax<00:02:10.470> paper<00:02:10.739> down<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.819> your<00:02:11.970> counter

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
wax paper down on your counter

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
wax paper down on your counter
I'm<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.050> gonna<00:02:13.200> flip<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:15.320> like<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:18.980> she's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'm just gonna flip it out like so she's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:32.450 
I'm just gonna flip it out like so she's
resourceful<00:02:20.930> okay<00:02:30.260> rolling<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.370> just

gonna roll it out let's pizza this is

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.670 
gonna roll it out let's pizza this is
weird<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.350> me<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.370> kind<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.730> weird

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
weird for me it is it's kind of weird

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.650 
weird for me it is it's kind of weird
I've<00:02:41.580> tried<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> whole<00:02:42.180> bunch<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> different

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
I've tried a whole bunch of different

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.270 
I've tried a whole bunch of different
paleo<00:02:43.230> marinades<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.270> um<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.840> has<00:02:46.040> been<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
paleo marinades and um this has been the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
paleo marinades and um this has been the
most<00:02:47.550> paleo<00:02:48.030> friendly<00:02:48.210> weight<00:02:56.960> we'll<00:02:57.960> get<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
most paleo friendly weight we'll get a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.460 
most paleo friendly weight we'll get a
close-up<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.770> meat<00:03:03.140> okay<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.350> you're

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
close-up of the meat okay and you're

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920 
close-up of the meat okay and you're
rolling<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> I'd<00:03:05.670> say<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.750> want

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
rolling it out to I'd say like you want

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.430 
rolling it out to I'd say like you want
less<00:03:07.200> than<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> quarter<00:03:07.800> inch<00:03:07.830> thick<00:03:09.440> somewhere

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
less than a quarter inch thick somewhere

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.940 
less than a quarter inch thick somewhere
between<00:03:10.560> 1/8<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.160> 1/4<00:03:11.370> inch<00:03:12.230> okay<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.830> when

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
between 1/8 and 1/4 inch okay so when

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.080 
between 1/8 and 1/4 inch okay so when
you're<00:03:14.070> done<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.520> got<00:03:14.670> something<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.060> looks

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you're done you got something that looks

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.370 
you're done you got something that looks
like<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.780> take<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> glass

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
like this and then I just take a glass

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.050 
like this and then I just take a glass
cutter<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.890> start<00:03:26.250> slicing<00:03:27.140> into<00:03:28.140> strips

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
cutter and I start slicing into strips

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.280 
cutter and I start slicing into strips
again<00:03:30.680> not<00:03:31.680> rocket<00:03:32.070> science<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.670> sizes

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
again not rocket science with the sizes

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.699 
again not rocket science with the sizes
so<00:03:34.290> whatever<00:03:34.530> works<00:03:36.350> you're<00:03:37.350> any<00:03:37.500> pieces

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
so whatever works you're any pieces

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.870 
so whatever works you're any pieces
aren't<00:03:38.040> gonna<00:03:38.130> be<00:03:38.310> as<00:03:38.400> pretty

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.350 

okay<00:03:47.370> now<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.450> pretty<00:03:49.690> much<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:51.240> in<00:03:52.240> your

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
okay now that is pretty much it in your

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.260 
okay now that is pretty much it in your
dehydrator<00:03:52.510> or<00:03:53.430> your<00:03:54.430> oven<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.180> know

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
dehydrator or your oven and you know

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.390 
dehydrator or your oven and you know
what<00:03:55.480> since<00:03:56.440> I've<00:03:56.560> never<00:03:56.800> done<00:03:57.070> it<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
what since I've never done it in the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.660 
what since I've never done it in the
oven<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.790> think<00:03:58.240> it's<00:03:58.530> 75<00:03:59.530> until<00:04:00.040> it's<00:04:00.190> done<00:04:00.430> but

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
oven I think it's 75 until it's done but

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:10.230 
oven I think it's 75 until it's done but
you<00:04:00.880> may<00:04:01.180> want<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:09.400> over<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:09.970> cut<00:04:10.210> it

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
you may want to just over it and cut it

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.900 
you may want to just over it and cut it
again<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.750> you're<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:10.990> literally<00:04:11.910> picking

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
again and you're just literally picking

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.430 
again and you're just literally picking
up<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.270> strips<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:15.160> laying<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.580> into<00:04:16.440> your

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
up the strips and laying it into your

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.260 
up the strips and laying it into your
dehydrator<00:04:17.560> that's<00:04:18.520> not<00:04:18.640> right<00:04:18.760> okay<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.030> I'm

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
dehydrator that's not right okay so I'm

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:26.670 
dehydrator that's not right okay so I'm
gonna<00:04:19.510> show<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.810> one<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:26.320> was<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.590> one

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
gonna show you that one it was that one

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.940 
gonna show you that one it was that one
prettier<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:28.330> little<00:04:29.110> bit<00:04:29.230> more<00:04:29.380> please<00:04:29.650> put

that one yeah I'll show you the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.090 
that one yeah I'll show you the
thickness<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.480> roughly<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.410> thickness<00:04:39.010> I

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
thickness to roughly the thickness I

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.220 
thickness to roughly the thickness I
mean<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.340> not<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:40.480> not<00:04:40.600> terribly<00:04:40.960> thick

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
mean it's not it's not terribly thick

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.800 
mean it's not it's not terribly thick
it's<00:04:41.920> not<00:04:42.070> too<00:04:42.250> thin<00:04:42.490> or<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.420> make<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.690> too

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
it's not too thin or it you make it too

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.030 
it's not too thin or it you make it too
thin<00:04:44.020> it's<00:04:44.140> gonna<00:04:44.260> be<00:04:44.440> brittle<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.830> break

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
thin it's gonna be brittle and break

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.090 
thin it's gonna be brittle and break
apart<00:04:50.520> tastes<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.790> delicious<00:04:51.910> too<00:04:52.770> good<00:04:53.770> grief

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
apart tastes so delicious too good grief

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.220 
apart tastes so delicious too good grief
it's<00:04:54.340> good<00:04:54.700> okay<00:04:55.210> so<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.420> just<00:04:55.450> lay<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.810> out<00:04:55.930> I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
it's good okay so you just lay it out I

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.070 
it's good okay so you just lay it out I
have<00:04:57.010> four<00:04:57.250> tiers<00:04:57.730> on<00:04:57.970> my<00:04:58.150> dehydrator<00:04:58.390> five<00:04:59.050> I

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
have four tiers on my dehydrator five I

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.110 
have four tiers on my dehydrator five I
think<00:04:59.380> if<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.530> count<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> bottom<00:05:00.130> one<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.820> I

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
think if I count the bottom one so I

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.810 
think if I count the bottom one so I
don't<00:05:01.570> need<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.170> worry<00:05:02.920> about<00:05:02.950> space<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.610> spread

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
don't need to worry about space I spread

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.140 
don't need to worry about space I spread
it<00:05:03.940> out<00:05:04.000> pretty<00:05:04.180> good<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:05.880> you're<00:05:06.880> gonna<00:05:06.970> do

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
it out pretty good and you're gonna do

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.230 
it out pretty good and you're gonna do
that<00:05:07.270> on<00:05:07.780> each<00:05:08.110> layer<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:09.580> then<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:10.120> are

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
that on each layer and then you are

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.360 
that on each layer and then you are
gonna<00:05:10.390> pop<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.870> into<00:05:11.080> your<00:05:11.320> dehydrator<00:05:12.070> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
gonna pop it into your dehydrator and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.400 
gonna pop it into your dehydrator and
it's<00:05:12.760> been<00:05:12.940> taking<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.480> think<00:05:13.720> about<00:05:13.930> four

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
it's been taking I think about four

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.250 
it's been taking I think about four
hours<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:15.220> mine<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:16.180> have<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.600> test<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.200> a

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
hours in mine you have to test it a

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.280 
hours in mine you have to test it a
little<00:05:17.440> bit<00:05:17.590> when<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:18.010> done<00:05:18.280> it's<00:05:19.150> going<00:05:19.870> to

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
little bit when it's done it's going to

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.950 
little bit when it's done it's going to
be<00:05:20.500> not<00:05:21.220> overly<00:05:21.820> -<00:05:22.060> it's<00:05:22.210> still<00:05:22.390> gonna<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:22.750> a

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
be not overly - it's still gonna have a

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.990 
be not overly - it's still gonna have a
little<00:05:23.110> bit<00:05:23.290> of<00:05:23.320> softness<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.920> it<00:05:23.950> one<00:05:24.850> of<00:05:24.940> the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
little bit of softness to it one of the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.250 
little bit of softness to it one of the
ways<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.360> check<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.870> as<00:05:26.290> its<00:05:27.780> dehydrating<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
ways to check is as its dehydrating the

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.110 
ways to check is as its dehydrating the
fats<00:05:29.830> will<00:05:30.250> come<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.640> top<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:31.030> you'll
