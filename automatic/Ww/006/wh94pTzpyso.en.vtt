filter<00:00:05.120> tour<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.150> guess<00:00:07.040> so<00:00:09.110> with<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.320> watch<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
filter tour I guess so with this watch I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.910 
filter tour I guess so with this watch I
filter<00:00:11.040> I'm<00:00:11.340> able<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.849> get<00:00:12.840> at<00:00:13.139> least<00:00:13.170> 300

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920

my aquarium this this this wet dry
filter<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.350> very<00:00:22.740> simple<00:00:23.130> home<00:00:23.939> done<00:00:24.619> well

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
filter is very simple home done well

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.810 
filter is very simple home done well
excluding<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> fact<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.599> plastic<00:00:28.820> like

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
excluding the fact that the plastic like

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
excluding the fact that the plastic like
the<00:00:29.849> container<00:00:30.269> itself<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> older<00:00:31.320> query

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the container itself was the older query

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.810 
the container itself was the older query
in<00:00:31.650> my<00:00:31.769> head<00:00:32.360> um<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.649> had<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.489> little

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
in my head um I had to do really little

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.110 
in my head um I had to do really little
to<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> excluding<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.050> had<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> drill<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> hole<00:00:38.129> as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to it excluding I had to drill a hole as

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.220 
to it excluding I had to drill a hole as
you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.960> through<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you can see right there through the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.900 
you can see right there through the
acrylic<00:00:40.920> um<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.879> had

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
acrylic um and that was all that I had

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
acrylic um and that was all that I had
to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.920> quiet<00:00:47.250> any

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to do and that was really quiet any

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.110 
to do and that was really quiet any
machinery<00:00:48.079> though<00:00:49.079> unless<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.879> have

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
machinery though unless you don't have

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
machinery though unless you don't have
like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> specific<00:00:52.320> cutout<00:00:53.059> plumbing<00:00:54.059> you're

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like a specific cutout plumbing you're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
like a specific cutout plumbing you're
going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> need<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> software<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.649> then

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
going to need a software that and then

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
going to need a software that and then
just<00:00:56.430> glue<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.699> PVC<00:00:59.699> together<00:01:01.489> okay<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.969> well

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
just glue the PVC together okay so well

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.450 
just glue the PVC together okay so well
because<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.909> planted<00:01:06.450> tank<00:01:06.450> i<00:01:07.460> also

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
because i have a planted tank i also

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
because i have a planted tank i also
bought<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.299> summer<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:10.939> carbon<00:01:11.939> dioxide<00:01:13.640> tank

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
bought this summer a carbon dioxide tank

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.929 
bought this summer a carbon dioxide tank
right<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.259> five<00:01:19.549> five<00:01:20.549> pound

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
bought this on three months ago four

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.819 
bought this on three months ago four
months<00:01:39.000> ago<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.680> as<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.329> this<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.570> my

months ago and as you can see this is my
internal<00:01:43.829> pressure<00:01:44.130> gauge<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.350> has<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> lot

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
internal pressure gauge it has a lot

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
internal pressure gauge it has a lot
left<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> carbon<00:01:49.350> dioxide<00:01:49.380> left

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
left it has a lot of carbon dioxide left

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
left it has a lot of carbon dioxide left
as<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.689> bubble

permit for a second right here like one
Mississippi<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:55.829> Mississippi<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.490> guess<00:01:56.729> like

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
Mississippi two Mississippi i guess like

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.200 
Mississippi two Mississippi i guess like
one<00:01:57.030> bottle<00:01:57.329> per<00:01:57.360> second<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.280> i<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
one bottle per second and i take this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.190 
one bottle per second and i take this
and<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.600> directly<00:02:01.140> inject<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:03.200> pump

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and I directly inject this into my pump

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039 
and I directly inject this into my pump
right<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.820> into<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
right here I put it like right into the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.160 
right here I put it like right into the
vents<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.099> water<00:02:08.369> comes<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
vents that water comes in and then the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.839 
vents that water comes in and then the
bubbles<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.679> crushed<00:02:11.039> by<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> impeller

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
bubbles get crushed by the impeller

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.600 
bubbles get crushed by the impeller
inside

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
inside

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the return watch with water and then the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.090 
the return watch with water and then the
little<00:02:19.510> bubbles<00:02:19.840> will<00:02:20.260> come<00:02:20.440> out<00:02:20.620> through<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
little bubbles will come out through the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.630 
little bubbles will come out through the
tubing<00:02:21.490> right<00:02:21.730> here<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.380> into<00:02:23.380> my<00:02:23.640> planted

tubing right here and into my planted
tank<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.180> here<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:27.750> don't<00:02:28.750> think<00:02:29.410> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
tank right here I don't think that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.570 
tank right here I don't think that
anyone<00:02:30.160> should<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.700> doing<00:02:31.030> do<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.660> yourself
