base defense video so right away we can

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.379 
base defense video so right away we can
see<00:00:11.880> Town<00:00:12.330> Hall<00:00:12.480> 6<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> upgrading<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> 7<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
see Town Hall 6 is upgrading to 7 so we

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.529 
see Town Hall 6 is upgrading to 7 so we
got<00:00:15.509> our<00:00:15.630> Archer<00:00:15.960> tower<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.500> maxed<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.190> our

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
got our Archer tower here maxed out our

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.519 
got our Archer tower here maxed out our
cannon<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.869> also<00:00:19.109> maxed<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.289> got<00:00:22.410> our

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
cannon here also maxed out so we got our

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.859 
cannon here also maxed out so we got our
two<00:00:22.920> archers<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> top<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.150> our<00:00:24.330> single

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
two archers at the top with our single

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
two archers at the top with our single
cannon<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.710> cordoned<00:00:26.310> off<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.730> see

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
cannon they are cordoned off you can see

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
cannon they are cordoned off you can see
they<00:00:27.150> cover<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.779> portion<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.470> base<00:00:28.740> so

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
they cover a good portion of our base so

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
they cover a good portion of our base so
we<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.730> our<00:00:29.910> wizard<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> middle<00:00:30.869> also

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
we have our wizard in the middle also

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160 
we have our wizard in the middle also
maxed<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.969> our<00:00:33.000> wizard<00:00:33.390> tower<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.780> setups

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
maxed out so our wizard tower is setups

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.190 
maxed out so our wizard tower is setups
near<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.770> gold<00:00:35.340> mine<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.270> gold<00:00:36.480> mines<00:00:36.750> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
near the gold mine the gold mines so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
near the gold mine the gold mines so
that<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.980> anyone<00:00:38.280> sends<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.910> goblins<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that if anyone sends just goblins on the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.229 
that if anyone sends just goblins on the
outside<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> base<00:00:40.760> it'll<00:00:41.760> protect<00:00:41.879> our

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
outside of the base it'll protect our

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
outside of the base it'll protect our
gold<00:00:42.510> lines<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.320> our<00:00:43.500> mortars<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
gold lines so we have our mortars on the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
gold lines so we have our mortars on the
middle<00:00:44.520> both<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.329> maxed<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.840> as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
middle both of them are maxed out as

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.590 
middle both of them are maxed out as
well<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> our<00:00:47.640> mortars<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.450> well

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
well so our mortars are pretty well

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
well so our mortars are pretty well
protected<00:00:48.780> our<00:00:49.379> air<00:00:49.770> defense<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.700> well

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
protected our air defense is also well

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
protected our air defense is also well
protected<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> centralized<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.710> that's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
protected and centralized I think that's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
protected and centralized I think that's
one<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> key<00:00:53.840> things<00:00:54.840> about<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.170> base<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
one of the key things about this base is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.189 
one of the key things about this base is
having<00:00:55.949> centralized<00:00:56.550> air<00:00:56.820> defense<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
having centralized air defense a lot of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
having centralized air defense a lot of
people<00:00:58.410> put<00:00:58.559> their<00:00:58.710> air<00:00:58.829> defense<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
people put their air defense on the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
people put their air defense on the
outside<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.329> easy<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
outside and then easy to take out and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.990 
outside and then easy to take out and
then<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.100> smashed<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:04.640> giant<00:01:05.640> healer

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
then you get smashed with giant healer

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
then you get smashed with giant healer
or<00:01:06.299> dragons<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.159> only<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.400> one

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
or dragons so I know we only have one

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
or dragons so I know we only have one
air<00:01:09.090> defense<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> level<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.590> think

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
air defense at this level but I think

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.440 
air defense at this level but I think
it's<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> good<00:01:11.640> idea<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
it's a good idea to have it in the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
it's a good idea to have it in the
middle<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.500> traps<00:01:13.920> set<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
middle so we got traps set up on the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.390 
middle so we got traps set up on the
bottom<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.570> both<00:01:15.869> two<00:01:16.590> spring<00:01:16.890> traps<00:01:17.159> set

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
bottom here so both two spring traps set

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.330 
bottom here so both two spring traps set
on<00:01:17.610> both<00:01:17.909> sides<00:01:18.409> we<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.500> four<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> our<00:01:20.100> bombs

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
on both sides we have four of our bombs

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
on both sides we have four of our bombs
put<00:01:20.700> against<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> Archer<00:01:21.780> tower<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> then

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
put against that Archer tower and then

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
put against that Archer tower and then
we<00:01:22.979> also<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.369> spring<00:01:23.670> traps<00:01:23.939> between<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
we also have spring traps between the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.499 
we also have spring traps between the
archer<00:01:25.110> tower<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.680> mortars<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.150> where<00:01:27.360> those

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
archer tower and mortars now where those

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
archer tower and mortars now where those
spring<00:01:27.930> traps<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> against

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
spring traps are there on the against

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859 
spring traps are there on the against
the<00:01:29.460> wall<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> pretty<00:01:30.420> good<00:01:30.570> spot<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the wall and that's a pretty good spot I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
the wall and that's a pretty good spot I
found<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.740> seems<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
found because that seems to be one of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700 
found because that seems to be one of
the<00:01:32.640> paths<00:01:32.960> Giants<00:01:33.960> take<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.560> get

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the paths Giants take when they get

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
the paths Giants take when they get
through<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> middle<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.420> also<00:01:36.600> have

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
through to the middle so we also have

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
through to the middle so we also have
builder<00:01:37.110> Hut's<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> we've<00:01:37.710> put<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
builder Hut's that we've put in the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.760 
builder Hut's that we've put in the
corners<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> prevent<00:01:39.360> people<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
corners to prevent people from on

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
corners to prevent people from on
representing<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.340> base<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.229> take<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
representing our base so if we take a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
representing our base so if we take a
look<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> last<00:01:43.950> three<00:01:44.189> replays<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:45.030> have

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
look at the last three replays we have

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
look at the last three replays we have
two<00:01:45.479> wins<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.140> loss<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.130> we'll<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.340> ahead

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
two wins and one loss so we'll go ahead

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
two wins and one loss so we'll go ahead
and<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> first<00:01:48.649> defensive<00:01:49.649> win<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> right

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and do the first defensive win so right

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620 
and do the first defensive win so right
away<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.740> guy<00:01:52.920> wants<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> take<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:53.820> air

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
away this guy wants to take out our air

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.209 
away this guy wants to take out our air
defense<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.170> he<00:01:55.259> drops<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.649> two<00:01:55.920> lightning

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
defense so he drops with two lightning

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.149 
defense so he drops with two lightning
spells<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.640> our<00:01:56.759> air<00:01:56.880> defense<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.159> doesn't

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
spells on our air defense and doesn't

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.580 
spells on our air defense and doesn't
doesn't<00:01:59.939> take<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.509> does<00:02:00.750> quite<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> bit

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
doesn't take it out but does quite a bit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
doesn't take it out but does quite a bit
of<00:02:01.680> damage<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:03.180> guy's<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> go

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of damage so this guy's going to go

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.999 
of damage so this guy's going to go
through<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> bottom<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> base<00:02:04.770> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
through the bottom of the base that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.590 
through the bottom of the base that
seems<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> where<00:02:05.790> most<00:02:06.060> people<00:02:06.360> went

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
seems to be where most people went

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.400 
seems to be where most people went
through<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.649> setup<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.229> why<00:02:10.379> I

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
through on this setup so that's why I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
through on this setup so that's why I
like<00:02:10.800> having<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> traps<00:02:11.489> set<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> bottom

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
like having the traps set at the bottom

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.309 
like having the traps set at the bottom
because<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> lot<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.720> people<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> go

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
because a lot of people like to go

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.850 
because a lot of people like to go
through<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
through the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360 
through the
bottom<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.190> base<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.830> his

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
bottom of this base so you can see his

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.890 
bottom of this base so you can see his
Giants<00:02:17.820> are<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.390> cannons

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
Giants are going to go for my cannons

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140 
Giants are going to go for my cannons
there's<00:02:19.290> three<00:02:19.650> Giants<00:02:20.070> gone<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:20.850> two

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
there's three Giants gone there's two

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.190 
there's three Giants gone there's two
more<00:02:21.330> Giants<00:02:21.780> gone

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
more Giants gone

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.230 
more Giants gone
so<00:02:22.770> right<00:02:22.950> away<00:02:23.070> five<00:02:23.520> Giants<00:02:23.970> were<00:02:24.060> just

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
so right away five Giants were just

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.580 
so right away five Giants were just
taken<00:02:24.510> out<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.750> spring<00:02:24.990> traps<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.470> though

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
taken out with spring traps so though

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.340 
taken out with spring traps so though
they're<00:02:25.890> very<00:02:26.250> effective<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.910> use<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> he's

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
they're very effective to use so he's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.230 
they're very effective to use so he's
going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> drop<00:02:28.740> his<00:02:28.890> healer<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.400> help<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.760> but

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
going to drop his healer to help out but

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
going to drop his healer to help out but
he<00:02:31.020> didn't<00:02:31.290> take<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> air<00:02:31.740> defense<00:02:32.040> he's

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
he didn't take out the air defense he's

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.350 
he didn't take out the air defense he's
going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.430> lose<00:02:32.580> his<00:02:32.700> healer<00:02:33.000> pretty<00:02:33.240> much

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to lose his healer pretty much

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.380 
going to lose his healer pretty much
right<00:02:33.540> away<00:02:34.130> our<00:02:35.130> clan<00:02:35.640> castle<00:02:36.000> troops<00:02:36.030> are

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
right away our clan castle troops are

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.620 
right away our clan castle troops are
helping<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.080> well<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.300> base

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
helping out as well now this base

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.710 
helping out as well now this base
doesn't<00:02:40.020> protect<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.040> elixir<00:02:41.430> storages<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
doesn't protect the elixir storages that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.150 
doesn't protect the elixir storages that
well<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.290> more<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.560> trophy<00:02:43.830> hunting

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
well this is more of a trophy hunting

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.910 
well this is more of a trophy hunting
base<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:45.270> can<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:45.930> 1350

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
base you can see that I'm at 1350

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.540 
base you can see that I'm at 1350
trophies<00:02:47.340> which<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.450> pretty<00:02:48.810> high<00:02:49.050> for

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
trophies which is pretty high for

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.060 
trophies which is pretty high for
townhall<00:02:50.550> six<00:02:51.110> most<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> bases<00:02:52.739> at<00:02:52.890> this

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
townhall six most of the bases at this

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.150 
townhall six most of the bases at this
level<00:02:53.280> are<00:02:53.520> town<00:02:53.820> L<00:02:53.970> 7<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.420> 8<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.890> get

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
level are town L 7 and 8 so I get

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 
level are town L 7 and 8 so I get
attacked<00:02:56.790> by<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> lot<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.360> Town<00:02:57.570> Hall<00:02:57.750> 7s<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
attacked by a lot of Town Hall 7s and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.040 
attacked by a lot of Town Hall 7s and
Town<00:02:58.500> Hall<00:02:58.680> 8<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.360> base<00:03:00.570> does<00:03:00.780> pretty

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
Town Hall 8 so this base does pretty

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.570 
Town Hall 8 so this base does pretty
well<00:03:01.170> considering<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.010> you're<00:03:02.340> being

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
well considering that you're being

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610 
well considering that you're being
attacked<00:03:02.880> by<00:03:03.030> level<00:03:03.420> 4<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.720> level<00:03:04.050> 5<00:03:04.260> troops

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
attacked by level 4 and level 5 troops

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.170 
attacked by level 4 and level 5 troops
very<00:03:05.010> frequently<00:03:07.040> all<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.850> let's<00:03:09.030> look

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
very frequently all right so let's look

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.870 
very frequently all right so let's look
at<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.600> other<00:03:09.900> replay<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.800> see<00:03:14.070> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
at the other replay so you can see that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
at the other replay so you can see that
the<00:03:15.720> replay<00:03:16.380> with<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.640> 100%<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.510> was<00:03:18.720> with

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the replay with that I 100% it was with

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.710 
the replay with that I 100% it was with
dragons<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.700> base<00:03:20.910> obviously<00:03:21.269> can't

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
dragons so this base obviously can't

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.570 
dragons so this base obviously can't
hold<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.110> too<00:03:22.320> well<00:03:22.350> against<00:03:22.890> like<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.100> dragon

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
hold up too well against like a dragon

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.150 
hold up too well against like a dragon
attack<00:03:23.850> one<00:03:24.810> only<00:03:25.260> one<00:03:25.440> air<00:03:25.620> defense<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.100> if

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
attack one only one air defense and if

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.560 
attack one only one air defense and if
it<00:03:26.280> gets<00:03:26.430> taken<00:03:26.610> out<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.150> you're<00:03:27.299> pretty

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
it gets taken out then you're pretty

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.280 
it gets taken out then you're pretty
much<00:03:27.750> volatile<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.620> getting<00:03:28.860> hundred<00:03:29.100> percent

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
much volatile to getting hundred percent

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.420 
much volatile to getting hundred percent
so<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.620> guy's<00:03:31.799> going<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.070> go<00:03:32.130> through<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
so this guy's going to go through the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.539 
so this guy's going to go through the
bottom<00:03:32.580> again<00:03:33.110> found<00:03:34.110> most<00:03:34.440> people<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:35.130> like

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.710 
bottom again found most people like like
to<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.760> through<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.000> bottom<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> base<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
to go through the bottom of the base it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.570 
to go through the bottom of the base it
seems<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.530> guess<00:03:37.830> an<00:03:37.980> easier<00:03:38.310> place<00:03:38.549> to

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
seems to be I guess an easier place to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.520 
seems to be I guess an easier place to
go<00:03:38.850> through<00:03:39.150> although<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.140> where<00:03:40.350> all<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
go through although that's where all the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.270 
go through although that's where all the
traps<00:03:40.799> are<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.900> definitely<00:03:43.860> does<00:03:44.040> it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
traps are so it definitely does it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.890 
traps are so it definitely does it
protects<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> base<00:03:45.209> very<00:03:45.450> well<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.810> these

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
protects the base very well so these

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.600 
protects the base very well so these
guys<00:03:49.110> are<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> go<00:03:49.530> through<00:03:49.860> trigger

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
guys are going to go through trigger

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.990 
guys are going to go through trigger
those<00:03:50.820> bombs<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.660> our<00:03:51.959> clan<00:03:52.230> castle<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.850> he's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
those bombs and our clan castle so he's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.449 
those bombs and our clan castle so he's
going<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.209> lose<00:03:54.420> Giants<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.350> both<00:03:55.620> sides<00:03:55.950> so

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
going to lose Giants on both sides so

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.690 
going to lose Giants on both sides so
there<00:03:56.760> goes<00:03:56.940> both<00:03:57.239> Giants<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> he's<00:03:59.489> going<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
there goes both Giants so he's going to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.729 
there goes both Giants so he's going to
spam<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> lot<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.750> archers<00:04:01.049> at<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.290> bottom<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
spam a lot of archers at the bottom so

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.979 
spam a lot of archers at the bottom so
they've<00:04:01.950> got<00:04:02.519> two<00:04:02.790> mortars<00:04:03.209> firing<00:04:03.510> at<00:04:03.780> them

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
they've got two mortars firing at them

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.750 
they've got two mortars firing at them
pretty<00:04:04.260> consistently<00:04:04.890> now<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.310> his<00:04:05.430> Giants

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
pretty consistently now that his Giants

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.300 
pretty consistently now that his Giants
are<00:04:05.850> pretty<00:04:06.030> much<00:04:06.180> gone<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> he's<00:04:08.160> going<00:04:08.250> to

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
are pretty much gone so he's going to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.490 
are pretty much gone so he's going to
try<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.670> drop<00:04:08.880> some<00:04:09.090> balloons<00:04:09.480> but<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.350> air

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
try and drop some balloons but the air

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.080 
try and drop some balloons but the air
defense<00:04:10.860> hasn't<00:04:11.070> been<00:04:11.310> taken<00:04:11.640> out<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.940> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
defense hasn't been taken out so that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.440 
defense hasn't been taken out so that
was<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.239> bit<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.660> bit<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.410> foolish<00:04:13.650> move<00:04:14.450> it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
was a bit of a bit of a foolish move it

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.030 
was a bit of a bit of a foolish move it
looks<00:04:15.600> like<00:04:15.750> he<00:04:15.900> misplaced<00:04:16.320> his<00:04:16.590> lightning

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
looks like he misplaced his lightning

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.289 
looks like he misplaced his lightning
spell<00:04:17.280> there<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.519> think<00:04:17.669> he<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:17.940> trying<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.180> go

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
spell there I think he was trying to go

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.979 
spell there I think he was trying to go
for<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.540> air<00:04:18.690> defense

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
for that air defense

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.860 
for that air defense
so<00:04:21.530> there<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.949> go<00:04:22.130> those<00:04:22.759> two<00:04:23.180> traps<00:04:23.479> boom

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
so there you go those two traps boom

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.870 
so there you go those two traps boom
gone<00:04:24.199> again<00:04:24.560> that's<00:04:25.250> why<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.550> having<00:04:25.669> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
gone again that's why I like having the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.779 
gone again that's why I like having the
traps<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.330> inside<00:04:27.550> seems<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.699> the

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
traps on the inside seems like the

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.150 
traps on the inside seems like the
Giants<00:04:29.180> travel<00:04:29.539> on<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.960> inside<00:04:30.349> path<00:04:30.650> there

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.770 

but<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.250> can<00:04:34.400> see<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.789> those<00:04:35.090> two<00:04:35.120> replays

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
but you can see that those two replays

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.499 
but you can see that those two replays
were<00:04:36.110> pretty<00:04:36.830> good<00:04:36.979> defensive<00:04:37.490> wins<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:38.360> one

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
were pretty good defensive wins the one

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.200 
were pretty good defensive wins the one
defense<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.349> was<00:04:39.710> lost<00:04:40.069> was<00:04:40.639> right<00:04:41.030> after

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
defense that was lost was right after

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.809 
defense that was lost was right after
that<00:04:41.419> last<00:04:42.229> attack<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:42.919> all<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.250> spring<00:04:43.520> traps

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
that last attack so all the spring traps

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.300 
that last attack so all the spring traps
were<00:04:44.030> taken<00:04:44.630> away<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.650> when<00:04:45.800> all<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.039> spring

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
were taken away so when all the spring

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.589 
were taken away so when all the spring
traps<00:04:46.550> are<00:04:46.699> gone<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.150> base<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.569> very

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
traps are gone the base is very

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.610 
traps are gone the base is very
vulnerable<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:48.650> if<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.860> leave<00:04:49.250> if<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:50.180> don't

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
vulnerable so if you leave if you don't

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.870 
vulnerable so if you leave if you don't
update<00:04:51.620> those<00:04:52.009> spring<00:04:52.250> traps<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.669> very

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
update those spring traps is very

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.969 
update those spring traps is very
vulnerable<00:04:53.090> this<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> good<00:04:54.380> base<00:04:54.590> defense

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
vulnerable this is a good base defense

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.260 
vulnerable this is a good base defense
in<00:04:55.130> my<00:04:55.250> opinion<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.699> don't<00:04:55.729> know<00:04:55.940> if<00:04:56.000> it's<00:04:56.120> the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
in my opinion I don't know if it's the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.939 
in my opinion I don't know if it's the
best<00:04:56.479> base<00:04:56.810> defense<00:04:57.199> but<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.500> was<00:04:57.620> working

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
best base defense but it was working

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.310 
best base defense but it was working
really<00:04:58.130> well<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.430> me<00:04:58.789> I<00:04:58.940> would<00:04:59.900> recommend

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
really well for me I would recommend

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.560 
really well for me I would recommend
using<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.680> town<00:05:00.889> all<00:05:01.070> six<00:05:01.310> I'm<00:05:01.490> pretty<00:05:02.270> high<00:05:02.419> in

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
using a town all six I'm pretty high in

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.879 
using a town all six I'm pretty high in
the<00:05:02.660> trophies<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.110> imagine<00:05:03.470> this<00:05:03.590> would<00:05:03.740> do

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
the trophies I imagine this would do

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.830 
the trophies I imagine this would do
really<00:05:04.340> really<00:05:04.610> well<00:05:04.759> at<00:05:05.150> about<00:05:05.330> 11<00:05:05.660> under

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
really really well at about 11 under

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.839 
really really well at about 11 under
these<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:06.800> right<00:05:07.039> that's<00:05:07.280> pretty<00:05:07.400> much<00:05:07.610> going

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
these all right that's pretty much going

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.520 
these all right that's pretty much going
