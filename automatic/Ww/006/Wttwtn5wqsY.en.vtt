00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
with this airplane which i think is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.260 
with this airplane which i think is
really<00:01:49.020> cool<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.880> either

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
really cool is that you can either

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.120 
really cool is that you can either
install<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> traditional<00:01:52.649> tail<00:01:52.890> dragger

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
install the traditional tail dragger

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
install the traditional tail dragger
landing<00:01:53.579> gear<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
landing gear or you can go with the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.109 
landing gear or you can go with the
water<00:01:55.290> floats<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.579> thought<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.000> be

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
water floats and I thought it would be

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
water floats and I thought it would be
more<00:01:57.299> fun<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> try<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> floats<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.350> first<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
more fun to try the floats out first and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
more fun to try the floats out first and
make<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> water<00:01:59.579> plane<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.450> while<00:02:00.659> we're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
make this a water plane and while we're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
make this a water plane and while we're
on<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.930> subject<00:02:01.079> take<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
on that subject take a look at the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
on that subject take a look at the
floats<00:02:02.670> itself<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.079> have

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
floats itself on the back you have

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.959 
floats itself on the back you have
working<00:02:04.740> water<00:02:05.100> rudders<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> airplane

a<00:03:44.980> little<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.489> weight<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.879> it<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.349> it's

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
a little bit of weight to it so it's

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.059 
a little bit of weight to it so it's
handling<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.920> very<00:03:47.980> well<00:03:48.340> right<00:03:48.640> now<00:03:49.980> what<00:03:50.980> do

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
handling it very well right now what do

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.300 
handling it very well right now what do
you<00:03:51.129> think<00:03:51.220> any<00:03:51.519> like<00:03:51.849> it<00:03:52.030> hmm<00:03:52.870> okay<00:03:55.349> now<00:03:56.349> we

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
you think any like it hmm okay now we

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.770 
you think any like it hmm okay now we
got<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.670> floats<00:03:57.879> on<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> airplane<00:03:58.569> with<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
got the floats on the airplane with the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.619 
got the floats on the airplane with the
working<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.290> water<00:03:59.530> rudders<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:01.450> should

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
working of water rudders so this should

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.059 
working of water rudders so this should
be<00:04:01.659> a<00:04:01.780> fun<00:04:02.019> airplane<00:04:02.379> on<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.560> water<00:04:02.799> but<00:04:03.040> you

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
be a fun airplane on the water but you

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.789 
be a fun airplane on the water but you
know<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.420> fun's<00:04:04.659> in<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.930> air<00:04:05.049> check<00:04:05.409> that<00:04:05.650> out

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
know the fun's in the air check that out

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.589 
know the fun's in the air check that out
nice<00:04:06.730> loop

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.449 

we're<00:04:10.080> having<00:04:10.319> fun<00:04:10.470> over<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.980> water<00:04:11.189> right

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
we're having fun over the water right

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.869 
we're having fun over the water right
yeah<00:04:12.650> we<00:04:13.650> don't<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.069> go<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.489> for<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
yeah we don't have to go in for the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.310 
yeah we don't have to go in for the
plane<00:04:15.090> that's<00:04:15.450> exactly<00:04:16.079> right

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
plane that's exactly right

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.710 
plane that's exactly right
no<00:04:16.949> I<00:04:16.979> didn't<00:04:17.370> bring<00:04:17.459> my<00:04:17.639> waders<00:04:17.820> today<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.570> my

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
no I didn't bring my waders today or my

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.800 

there's<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.640> slow<00:04:26.060> lazy<00:04:26.570> roll<00:04:28.360> which<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.540> pretty

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
there's a slow lazy roll which is pretty

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.500 
there's a slow lazy roll which is pretty
good<00:04:30.080> for<00:04:30.140> airplane<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:31.010> floats<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.730> in<00:04:32.120> a

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
good for airplane with floats on it in a

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.680 
good for airplane with floats on it in a
10<00:04:32.690> mile<00:04:32.900> an<00:04:32.930> hour<00:04:33.110> wind<00:04:34.150> now<00:04:35.150> I'm<00:04:35.360> not<00:04:35.540> going

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
10 mile an hour wind now I'm not going

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.090 
10 mile an hour wind now I'm not going
to<00:04:35.750> try<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:35.960> being<00:04:36.260> crazy<00:04:36.470> like<00:04:36.770> inverted

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
to try it being crazy like inverted

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.770 
to try it being crazy like inverted
flying<00:04:37.550> with<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.850> airplane<00:04:38.180> because<00:04:38.420> it's

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
flying with the airplane because it's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.420 
flying with the airplane because it's
just<00:04:38.990> it's<00:04:39.380> not<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> good<00:04:40.010> day<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:40.250> that

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
just it's not a good day for that

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.850 
just it's not a good day for that
besides<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.270> don't<00:04:41.360> see<00:04:41.650> airplanes<00:04:42.650> with

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
besides you don't see airplanes with

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.490 
besides you don't see airplanes with
clothes<00:04:43.130> on<00:04:43.660> we're<00:04:44.660> going<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.960> inverted<00:04:45.320> over

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
clothes on we're going to inverted over

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.470 
clothes on we're going to inverted over
the<00:04:45.590> water<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:46.430> check<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:46.940> out<00:04:47.120> I've<00:04:47.330> got

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
the water but check that out I've got

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.710 
the water but check that out I've got
the<00:04:47.630> flaps<00:04:47.960> on<00:04:48.610> look<00:04:49.610> how<00:04:49.760> slow<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.360> coming

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
the flaps on look how slow it's coming

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.510 
the flaps on look how slow it's coming
in

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.189 

perfect<00:04:57.440> alright<00:04:59.810> that<00:05:00.810> was<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:00.990> long

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
perfect alright that was a long

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.240 
perfect alright that was a long
touch-and-go<00:05:02.389> how<00:05:03.389> about<00:05:03.690> that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
touch-and-go how about that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.040 
touch-and-go how about that
okay<00:05:05.250> flight<00:05:05.490> times<00:05:05.759> on<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.030> battery<00:05:06.389> are

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
okay flight times on the battery are

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.270 
okay flight times on the battery are
probably<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.800> be<00:05:07.860> around<00:05:08.160> the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
probably going to be around the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.029 
probably going to be around the
eight-minute<00:05:08.699> mark<00:05:08.849> as<00:05:09.710> always<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.919> know<00:05:11.009> I

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
eight-minute mark as always you know I

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.040 
eight-minute mark as always you know I
tell<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.639> to<00:05:12.000> fly<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.599> first<00:05:12.810> time

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
tell you to to fly it for the first time

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.980 
tell you to to fly it for the first time
for<00:05:13.380> less<00:05:13.680> than<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.009> and<00:05:14.599> use<00:05:15.599> a<00:05:15.630> battery

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
for less than that and use a battery

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.629 
for less than that and use a battery
checker<00:05:16.259> to<00:05:16.470> gauge<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.889> power<00:05:17.099> on<00:05:17.310> your<00:05:17.460> berry

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
checker to gauge the power on your berry

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.170 
checker to gauge the power on your berry
to<00:05:17.910> see<00:05:18.090> your<00:05:18.780> flight<00:05:18.990> time<00:05:19.259> to<00:05:19.410> correct<00:05:19.740> and

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
to see your flight time to correct and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.610 
to see your flight time to correct and
as<00:05:21.180> far<00:05:21.360> as<00:05:21.419> this<00:05:21.630> airplane<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.080> concerned<00:05:22.440> for

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
as far as this airplane is concerned for

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.770 
as far as this airplane is concerned for
the<00:05:22.680> flyer<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.250> think<00:05:23.970> it's<00:05:24.120> more<00:05:24.240> intended<00:05:24.630> for

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
the flyer I think it's more intended for

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.960 
the flyer I think it's more intended for
the<00:05:24.870> intermediate<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.530> advanced<00:05:25.860> fliers<00:05:26.220> a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
the intermediate and advanced fliers a

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.210 
the intermediate and advanced fliers a
novice<00:05:27.690> could<00:05:27.960> possibly<00:05:28.440> fly<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.800> airplane

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
novice could possibly fly this airplane

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.600 
novice could possibly fly this airplane
with<00:05:30.210> some<00:05:30.419> flight<00:05:30.659> sim<00:05:30.930> training<00:05:31.349> or<00:05:31.830> if<00:05:32.310> you

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
with some flight sim training or if you

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.460 
with some flight sim training or if you
have<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.849> high<00:05:33.389> wing<00:05:33.599> trainer<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:34.050> ailerons

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
have a high wing trainer with ailerons

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.809 
have a high wing trainer with ailerons
like<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.430> sensei

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.870 

you<00:05:38.819> could<00:05:39.000> probably<00:05:39.180> try<00:05:39.630> this<00:05:39.810> airplane<00:05:40.199> out

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
you could probably try this airplane out

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.430 
you could probably try this airplane out
ok<00:05:41.880> well<00:05:42.000> I<00:05:42.330> think<00:05:42.479> I've<00:05:42.750> had<00:05:42.870> enough<00:05:42.930> fun<00:05:43.229> with

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
ok well I think I've had enough fun with

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.600 
ok well I think I've had enough fun with
the<00:05:43.530> candy<00:05:43.860> let's<00:05:44.789> bring<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.090> on<00:05:45.150> in<00:05:46.550> what<00:05:47.550> do

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
the candy let's bring it on in what do

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.850 
the candy let's bring it on in what do
you<00:05:47.669> think<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:48.120> like<00:05:48.630> when<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:48.900> land<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.259> on<00:05:49.440> the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
you think I like when you land it on the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.430 
you think I like when you land it on the
water

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
water

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.310 
water
Wow<00:05:51.980> windy<00:05:52.610> yeah<00:05:53.330> check<00:05:53.810> that<00:05:53.840> out

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:19.320 

nothing<00:05:57.320> in
