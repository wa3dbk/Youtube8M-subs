00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello what if German present it from another community do not pay offense 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.649
 i the the lic 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.309
 I'm not the poll on him joseph alfonso siciliana 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.309
 Sicilian defense variant Najdorf 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.739
 I know I spent a lot of time between my last video 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.519
 and before you start this decent life app this video of yours 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.060
 If you wanted to devote to rum and sing sing stop poking 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.650
 who died between 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.720
 interview between the first video and this 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.950
 well yes more preambles we are going to 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.090
 we are going to the English attack that think about it to give de lara the variant najdorf 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.790
 so then we have the 4 c5 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.819
 at 8 3 out of 6 out of four 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.280
 Sepor de cuatro went through four 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.409
 went through six 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.640
 cavazos others already six that surely and start thinking 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.620
 all this we only see the first video 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.390
 we remember because it was played to prevent 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 in pozuelo felem does not fear either 5 80 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.240
 on a flight the previous day we saw the variants would be with the g5 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.550
 so this video or are you just with 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.700
 the moves and the english cta begins 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.020
 bishop 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.180
 3 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.310
 p the idea of ​​fire 3 this but that single piece 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.350
 and now because they are lending that is now very powerful 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 that go from a7 to g 1 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 and the one that will do from h6 pasta euros 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.390
 d is also displayed from the center cluster 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.960
 it also protects it ends solid in defense where four before possible 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.360
 attacks 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.150
 everything is played on c5 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.390
 the idea of ​​5 2% on serve can not give the deadly check of April 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 in five before they started ar if the space of the center by the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.920
 heras 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.660
 and the idea is to take out the cellar or flight 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.300
 that is this 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.150
 percent and 4 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.350
 the cava are all removed 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870
 aa of three 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.620
 and then play 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.369
 bishops 6 yes with the idea of ​​continuing attacking sópot a méndez a rosaura 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.059
 feet 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.969
 m3 a play that 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.219
 it does not seem so important but it is 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.599
 when the idea behind this play what now we can not think in total 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.760
 our coso 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.790
 I expressed iss 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.000
 can not jump four to attack was the end 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.200
 as I said then that the idea f3 is to keep the pil stable 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.589
 in n 3 that does not have any 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.729
 attacking moment 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.029
 alfie 7 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.539
 development in one piece 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.539
 i lady fingers 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.899
 the mother idea or will now position the way in the same col in the same and 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:48.949
 Now I want to say 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.959
 exerting pressure on the possible outbreak rock january 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.509
 white king 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.589
 and also preparing it surrounds 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.399
 the castling the net 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.539
 the hero has anyway provoked 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.789
 for franco r do not give noel happens to us if we have to 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.349
 it scares us for this attack 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.329
 and the white one closed karen in rock in laredo 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.540
 everything was time that this tower and nothing else to have a good one in a good 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.910
 percent in a good column by putting pressure on something of a 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.459
 time 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 cavazos de siete develop pesos 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.239
 i think 4 a classic movement 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.040
 in of the Sicilian defense when he benevolent procopal franco r the idea is 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.640
 start takargo we played with the white pawns under franco r 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.970
 begin to exercise feel pressure on the pieces that we are placed as per 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.519
 example consort 6 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.119
 and in a possible case such in the fil 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.819
 d the 6 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.949
 the idea is on the part of the then counter 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.379
 this initiative 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.379
 when the 5 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.430
 almost opened me up and this tower could very well be very very dangerous being 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.319
 here 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.829
 the game albeit with 3 5 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.829
 threatened all that but January a good move 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.509
 d 4 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.629
 now the costs of being threatened 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.909
 what is the idea behind four tries to set a trap January because that 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.259
 money plays 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.629
 trails plays 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.639
 percent 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.099
 that's why they say 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.240
 that is not good 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.199
 because after 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.300
 b for c3 the hero only attacks 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.499
 employs and white prosol attacks 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.509
 by the threatened amate 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.890
 and santi in case you want to take our beloved 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.259
 mmm the white to be in check 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.740
 in this way the initiative is lost that has no plans for 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.710
 press 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.499
 that's why later because of then 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.699
 the white plays cavazos to prevent 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.230
 in order to continue operating 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.180
 our case that has pressed 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.189
 and then it is removed 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.319
 and now we also have an interesting variant because the best for the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.490
 white juar in four 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.310
 trying to continue exercising peer pressure on the noa on the flank 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.479
 king 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.330
 you do not eat 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.240
 in we promise who sees 4 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.169
 because it creates a very good variant to generate stress 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.889
 we take for four 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.409
 and now he is the one who has no sense 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.159
 because the mistress who attacked 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.249
 and now the pawn of five tactically little four hour time 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.050
 just times attacking until the end these of the tambo tendedera white 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.429
 in 3 for that reason the plants are not usually eaten they are not usually eaten 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.469
 this toll this plan 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.270
 in four 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.009
 well after 13 4 that the best move 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.869
 although well 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.839
 and now on this side it is already completely matched 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.810
 bonus this english door 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.869
 I hope you associate them sink I hope you will 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:08.710
 been useful 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.960
 percent and be aware of my next video I am a very game 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.029
 interesting 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.779
 will deliver master the prosperous 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.830
 against the miguel people 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.219
 good I hope of loas have enjoyed 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:22.269
 i feb 8
