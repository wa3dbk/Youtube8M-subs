00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.440
 Hello, today I will try to capture the story mutap Diego 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520
 Confessions on the 5th floor are the same as on the 104th floor. 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 I did. 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:19.970
 In the case of the 100th floor, CLEO and VELIKA appeared, 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.550
 This is because they attack your dog or using a so-called haneunge play 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.850
 I can only proceed safely by 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:34.060
 And it 's a state attack like poisoning, burns and petrified ice 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.060
 I think it's good to use spikes because they come in a lot . 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.790
 In the first stage, we will talk to the gang, 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.790
 Doegoyo state laws need to be created 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.910
 I mean, you're a little low on your strength. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.910
 Oh , I wrote poetry to make it all unnecessary. 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.950
 Right now, before the second phase, Lena is right, but she 's a little low. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.330
 Lost 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.330
 When you come to this stage, because there are many wide-area attacks, 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.600
 Single attack is a little less fit. 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.640
 After writing this word in this way 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 The so- called single attack is 100% weak. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.330
 Because you get in, you can fix a nobody like this. 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.570
 If the parties do so, the throat Puts one foot just stunning place to walk to the front row fainted 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.900
 I need to wait for the next cool down while I'm writing a flat. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.100
 I was just stunned without freezing CLEO . 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:48.250
 If you raise Claire here , you will only hit Belle, 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.250
 Because the characters can share the barriers 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.770
 With Cloo stunned like this 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:01.630
 When cool, wait striking back over the mark so eolrigo 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 If you stir the film in a basic way, you can go smoothly 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.930
 There is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.409
 Oo 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:19.659
 So Delica got the chlorine, Cleo got the key in the frozen state , 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.659
 You can beat it again and fill it up. 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.500
 This way, fill it with blood and put it back in. 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:34.570
 Now when played over the end of the dam because it does not hurt to do so pyeongta 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.110
 When I walk, I see the anemia in the front row again. 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.340
 If you write down your stunning, it usually takes a lot of compression. 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 If this is the case , Belleca will laugh to a degree, and CLEO will 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 There is a situation where you can make a full buff again before you go to step 3. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.420
 It is. 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:02.610
 In this issue, I had a little low blood pressure , so I arrived here 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:09.920
 Yes, because mobs now have a wide range of attacks, 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.920
 Because of this , it does not fit into a single attack, 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.590
 After filling the hilope, 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.580
 If you use the heart in this same way as Step 2 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.540
 The opponent who is caught with the chlorine gets to take it, so it gets late to the usual one. 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:34.890
 Now if there are three stages like this, there is a spin break here 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.099
 So there in the same place one walks over the stunned mark waiting 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.560
 If you care, it's immune. 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:48.000
 Now I do not have a front eolril be the guy, where do you salt stunned 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:53.040
 Do not use it. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.340
 If you like chlorine, you have to write it to Belica. 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.340
 You can continue to beat your goofy with other skills. 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:07.290
 If you use this wide area, you can fit the gap between the valleys . 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:11.370
 Just be careful and keep doing this. 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.609
 Hello goofy because if not that many conductors like so overwhelmed 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.989
 And if you put the movie right into Velika 3 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:22.169
 100 5th floor is easy to do so. 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.720
 When you are alone in this way, 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:30.979
 Because it tickles epilepsy , here's all the skills you need here , 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.979
 You can melt it like this 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:41.620
 Yoreotge nicely with the case of the cold makta thus struck layer 105 FIG. 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.360
 You cleared it. 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:51.040
 Now even had a clear five people live safely so yobeon 100 5th floor 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.320
 If you are like I was clearing took only about five minutes shorter yoreotge some time 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.060
 In the case of compensation 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 The ring will come out of this useless protection and you will have to give up the character that remains. 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.820
 It's the same. 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:07.590
 If such a confession is when the sixth floor is a little difficult right now there wandering Clear 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.590
 I will keep uploading the video.
