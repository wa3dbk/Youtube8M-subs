00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:15.330
 video about replacing such a paste with liquid 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:17.750
 metal cooler and such a processor and 5450 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.750
 Total 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:38.800
 That we dismantle the cooler 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:38.800
 has pasta kpt-8 cooler. 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:57.510
 something might hit during installation here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.720
 700 I take out the processor now it is good 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.500
 solvent wipe now later here 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.840
 wipe everything look at the surface 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.960
 in more detail how she feels 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.660
 perhaps useful sandpaper here principle 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 all filmed 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.530
 here is our processor 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.050
 a little wipe rope Coolie rock 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.060
 in principle, degrease with operating 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 solvent and I will smear 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.260
 the girl this tikhonov surface was 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.720
 visible risks are tears which 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.720
 processed also on the processor 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 noticed such defects were here 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.970
 somewhere a little bit you see them a little bit 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.130
 I didnâ€™t plan everything 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.980
 because sticks miles from coppers on 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.330
 liquid metal then problems a little 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.760
 tear off therefore one surface 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 left such a brilliant well, I'll be right now 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.740
 to put 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.530
 all prepared well, and make pulled 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.530
 a little more and process 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.709
 assembling brother in general, all gathered only 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.709
 here I put the same 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:47.870
 The temperature in this program is 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:50.870
 the temperature here is so well and starting 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
 unix 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:11.000
 in general, we wait for an hour 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.750
 The program is here and the settings added 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.260
 plank 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:21.319
 Hector RAM means here 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.599
 temperature data why not ship 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.989
 lazy because I do not know about 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:31.040
 wrong here under this program by 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.700
 this data happens not to go to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.470
 factor 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.370
 one 8h with half there in general this 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.370
 program completely 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 in general, that's the temperature now 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.599
 maximally all this three graphics 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.239
 linux 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.829
 and here it is now cct 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.629
 even on neville temperature somehow 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:07.639
 it seems to me more such data now 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:12.260
 I will try to disperse above now I 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.700
 I will say the frequency now it turns out here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.319
 such 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.319
 three 570
