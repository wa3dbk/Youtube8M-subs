finally return on HBO something that

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.490 
finally return on HBO something that
seemed<00:03:46.349> highly<00:03:46.829> unlikely<00:03:47.549> months<00:03:48.090> ago<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:49.260> we

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
seemed highly unlikely months ago so we

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.289 
seemed highly unlikely months ago so we
all<00:03:49.680> thought<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.069> they<00:03:50.730> were<00:03:50.819> going<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.060> give

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
all thought that they were going to give

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.319 
all thought that they were going to give
rego<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.379> shaft<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:54.150> know

rego the shaft but you know

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.920 
rego the shaft but you know
realistically<00:03:55.340> rego<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.639> people<00:03:57.359> like<00:03:57.540> me<00:03:57.750> on

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
realistically rego and people like me on

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.559 
realistically rego and people like me on
youtube<00:03:58.199> and<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.980> maybe<00:03:59.609> even<00:03:59.849> other<00:04:00.180> people

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
youtube and and maybe even other people

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.009 
youtube and and maybe even other people
they<00:04:01.290> had<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.769> no<00:04:02.010> justice<00:04:02.609> no<00:04:02.819> peace<00:04:03.060> type

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
they had that no justice no peace type

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.500 
they had that no justice no peace type
approach<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.859> i<00:04:05.549> think<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.940> pressure<00:04:06.180> got<00:04:06.449> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
approach and i think the pressure got to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.259 
approach and i think the pressure got to
HBO<00:04:06.989> at<00:04:07.859> least<00:04:08.159> i<00:04:08.310> would<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.790> hope<00:04:09.000> that

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
HBO at least i would like to hope that

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.500 
HBO at least i would like to hope that
has<00:04:09.900> something<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.349> do<00:04:10.500> with<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:11.180> also<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.329> man

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.279 
did have a damn contract with top-ranked
and<00:04:14.940> top-ranked<00:04:15.419> wasn't<00:04:15.750> gonna<00:04:15.870> put<00:04:16.079> them<00:04:16.169> on

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
and top-ranked wasn't gonna put them on

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.949 
and top-ranked wasn't gonna put them on
showtime<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.459> they<00:04:17.760> really<00:04:18.359> had<00:04:18.510> no<00:04:18.720> choice

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
showtime so they really had no choice

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.620 
showtime so they really had no choice
but<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.769> put<00:04:19.949> him<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.220> network<00:04:20.630> eventually

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
but to put him on the network eventually

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.409 
but to put him on the network eventually
they<00:04:22.590> were<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.919> trying<00:04:23.190> their<00:04:23.400> best<00:04:23.430> not<00:04:24.210> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
they were just trying their best not to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.580 
they were just trying their best not to
do<00:04:24.539> it<00:04:24.659> but<00:04:24.690> they<00:04:24.840> really<00:04:25.169> couldn't<00:04:25.380> get

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
do it but they really couldn't get

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.140 
do it but they really couldn't get
around

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
around

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.770 
around
so<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.680> know<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.430> contracts<00:04:29.030> haven't<00:04:29.660> been

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
so you know the contracts haven't been

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.830 
so you know the contracts haven't been
signed<00:04:30.139> yet<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:31.490> assuming<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.419> they<00:04:32.570> will

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840
