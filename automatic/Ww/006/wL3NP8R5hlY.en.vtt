have<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> pull<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> longer<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.380> back

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
have to pull that longer one back

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.700 
have to pull that longer one back
through<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> wall<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> off

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
through that wall when you take it off

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
through that wall when you take it off
you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> off<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you can take it off like that and that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
you can take it off like that and that
preserves<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.899> loop<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.189> now

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
preserves that loop right there okay now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310 
preserves that loop right there okay now
I'm<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> put<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.810> again<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
I'm going to put it back on again and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
I'm going to put it back on again and
I'm<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> put<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.490> lunes<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> I'm

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
I'm going to put it on a lunes and I'm

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.030 
I'm going to put it on a lunes and I'm
going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> tell<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> why<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.409> cool

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
animals monkey grip technology well when

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.420 
animals monkey grip technology well when
you<00:02:12.599> take<00:02:12.810> monkey<00:02:13.230> grip<00:02:13.410> technology<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.340> you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you take monkey grip technology and you

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.699 
you take monkey grip technology and you
made<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.940> monkey<00:02:15.300> herm<00:02:15.480> technology<00:02:16.140> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
made it with monkey herm technology you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.320 
made it with monkey herm technology you
get<00:02:16.860> two<00:02:17.099> happy<00:02:17.459> monkeys<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.300> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
get two happy monkeys that don't want to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.630 
get two happy monkeys that don't want to
let<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.500> let<00:02:19.650> me<00:02:19.769> show<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.160> how<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.400> works

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
let go so let me show you how that works

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
let go so let me show you how that works
let<00:02:20.910> me<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.239> back<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.569> again<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.810> there's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
let me put it back on again so there's

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.160 
let me put it back on again so there's
that<00:02:22.890> loop<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.879> inner<00:02:24.060> loop<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that loop the inner loop I'm going to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.949 
that loop the inner loop I'm going to
put<00:02:25.319> my<00:02:25.470> foot<00:02:25.739> through<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.250> loop<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.959> into

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
put my foot through that loop and into

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.530 
put my foot through that loop and into
the<00:02:28.080> shoe<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.610> loop<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.120> coming<00:02:30.390> here

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the shoe so now that loop is coming here

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.119 
the shoe so now that loop is coming here
it<00:02:30.720> comes<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> back<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.709> tail<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
it comes out the back the tail on the

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.979 
it comes out the back the tail on the
back<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:33.120> gonna<00:02:33.239> bring<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.599> around<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
back you're gonna bring it around the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.320 
back you're gonna bring it around the
side<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.680> outside<00:02:35.069> side<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.180> you're

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
side the outside side and then you're

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.500 
side the outside side and then you're
gonna<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.200> tie<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> regular<00:02:38.209> shoelace<00:02:39.209> like

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510

this could be my camp shoe and I can

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.750 
this could be my camp shoe and I can
drove<00:02:43.739> around<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.310> actually<00:02:44.459> start

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
drove around I can actually start

drove around I can actually start
wearing<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.380> but<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.650> also<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.370> course

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
wearing this but it's also of course

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.220 
wearing this but it's also of course
designed<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.269> with<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.510> Luna<00:02:48.810> sandals
