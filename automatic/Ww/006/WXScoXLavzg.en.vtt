 in this video we will see how easy it is to create 9 of the studio photos with 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.609
 beautiful calendars 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.389
 we select the images we want to include go to public 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.809
 calendars 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.539
 in this first screen we can decide whether to add brass for 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.439
 any images 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.949
 click on next 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.169
 and we are now on the page where to set the characteristics of the sheet 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.380
 then the page size 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.720
 the unit margin orientation and so on 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.920
 movement and up ahead leads us to ascend the lay-out of the calendar 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.580
 we can choose between various predefined lea, for example this with two 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.430
 months or this with 6 months and if you imagine 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.210
 choose for example the first one 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.630
 click on next 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.830
 at this point we decide 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.200
 how to view the months 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.950
 how to display the names of the days which are special days and so on 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.540
 etc 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.570
 click on next again 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.110
 we set how the program you have to insert the images in the paintings 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.940
 let's see this point a preview of the calendar in which we can still 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 click on next 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 and we decide what to do with the stupendous ryo and so if you save it save it 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 as a bitmap or for example to export them in pdf format 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.420
 we set the typical parameters of the pdf files 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.310
 including image compression and itp you have for printing 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.050

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.140
