Lycamobile was established in 2003 to serve
the growing immigrant diaspora worldwide with

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.970
a high quality international calling product

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.820
. A target market of 200 million customers
globally.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.750
Lycamobile is the world leader in the international
calling business.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.769

our 10th market.

An MVNO is a virtual network operator effectively
who leases space from an encumbrance such

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.710
as Telstra and piggy backs on their network
to deliver a service to specific target markets.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.220
Lycamobile aims to be the benchmark MVNO in
this sector

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.989

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.060
Australia is a sizeable target market that
has close to 6 million immigrants, students

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.320
and quite a travelling community between Europe,
the US and Australia.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.330
Our first challenge was to find the best network
partner for us, we started to search early

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.470
last year and I'm delighted to have closed
the partnership with Telstra Wholesale.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.470

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.190
e chose Telstra Wholesale because of their
responsiveness the professionalism they demonstrated

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.000
all through the process and most importantly
the quality of the network

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.590
&gt;&gt; Lycamobile and Telstra Wholesale recognised
a tremendous opportunity in the Australian

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.560
pre-paid market, essentially Telstra Wholesale
provides an MVNO solution to Lycamobile which

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.280
provides access to our GSM network covering
96% of the Australian population terminating

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.221
calls to Australian fixed and mobile numbers
and handing off international calls to Lycamobile

00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.310
for termination on their network.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.010

a number of overseas markets in Europe

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.970

the Australian market place

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.840

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.310
which should provide a very successful entry
into the Australian market

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.110
&gt;&gt; The service that we offer is a life saving
service that allows a target market to stay

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.270
in touch with their friends and family worldwide.
