 bruno salomone so that's in theory 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.949
 at first we could have even been interested 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.170

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.170
 Salmon Salmon is a salmon ancestor 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.079

 today at comedy tragedy humor a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.649
 as you showed then good 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.829
 tragedy it's very simple a trait that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.690
 just works this goat and well the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 song the goat's field so that's all the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.039
 world are been one was very very fast 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 including the field of the ball that I plow 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.540
 young you will do it more and actor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 to comedies it's the same structure 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 it's both elements as is said 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 is said murphy is a murphy eddie 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 the beverly hills cop who's when 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.020
 even one of the great comedies of this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.580
 century remains, however, the case of a 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 dead who is still a lot more 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 complex so good so are you figuring 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.180
 that so as you said humor 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 appeared only in France in the eighteenth 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.240
 century that's it actually that's it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.920
 actually does that three hundred years 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 we at least have the front in France 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 had not said or humor ie 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.439
 that you arrived in the Middle Ages but that they 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.270
 have said koné toto's joke 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.540
 banon toilet effect one word either 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.820
 fortunately 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.259
 happily the English in the eighteenth 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.939
 century brought us from the dying of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.619
 the less they reported to us because they 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.810
 we borrowed ourselves as 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.560
 had said of our humor mood that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 was more than is not at all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 same meaning as those we hear 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.899
 now the emotional state either 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.369
 morals and know how to increase 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.159
 finally all the body fluids there 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.140
 had booked the saliva lymph all to 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.329
 stop here are the moods and we have 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100
 besides still this meaning there when we 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.899
 described 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.180
 the structure of the eyeball we speak 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.610
 from the vitreous humor the aqueous humor so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.410
 when idy neighbor rock alone on the sand 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.370
 i in the water do not have eyes in 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.900
 water the water in the eyes and before we 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.819
 did not think a person's light 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 depends on his moods and even in our 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.209
 language we still kept to be 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.280
 that when we say you do not bile 1 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.010
 where my blood has gone 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.209
 where do you want me you make me sweat or even 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.340
 we attack this notion of the fact that we 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.310
 is a liquid we say I'm good I'm 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.819
 overwhelmed okay it's cool it's cool 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.130
 it's cool 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.660
 by the way yesterday there is this feeling that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.370
 hands as a species of the container that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.230
 is crossed by a parent running there 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.850
 it's a kind of tide 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 are we going to laugh and the sea ​​is 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.319
 remove we do not want to laugh anymore 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.980
 mother comes back and we laugh well yes it's 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.170
 that and is actually that's the drama of 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.480
 the bear and ending up as a vase 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.709
 empty because someone is going to say 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.090
 someone who wants to do cow humor 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.010
 for guillaume there is nothing in it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.330
 the township hop it by clubbing date 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.799
 so at once they entrust some 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.209
 thing of his vast where he is a bit empty 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.450
 and he expects something in return 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.900
 he is waiting for what may come from 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.790
 they are happy but they will come 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.290
 or not and that's what is tragic about 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.519
 once sent the guy is like that bleeds to 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.959
 you know the history of the chair 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.150
 and the customers of a sewer this silence 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.070
 but alas, maybe you hear it 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.750
 sing the goat the lebouc hears him 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.190
 sing to lower these tragic 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.959
 what is going on to fight Maltese badly 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.190
 you do not see what a tragedian who 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.450
 do not manage to move it does not matter you 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.280
 have not hurt for him but someone that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.359
 humor and that does not happen cc 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.320
 it's terrible because in fact 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.209
 humor is not an affirmation 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.820
 humor is a question ie 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.480
 when someone says you know abel of 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.459
