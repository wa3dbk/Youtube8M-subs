 or there it is another program talking nonsense about clients 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.270
 is the case of the pilot 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.339
 I'm here to talk 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.530
 bad of everything that you 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.789
 the handle 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.789
 d 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.029
 the girl 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.750
 in the new program 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 They said that she was very run down with the words I had not since I 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.750
 no one warned me that I should be careful with words 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.719
 we struggle for a serious crisis to do something more elaborate 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.920
 I caught 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 a list of topics it occupies there 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 I wrote 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.960
 in an escape the fury I wrote on a piece of paper 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 and now it's under the quarry 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 I'll get it for you, said 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.650
 you said 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.520
 there is maybe I have taken off a little past the fights program 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.190
 but enough I wanted to say 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.880
 about this fight 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.130
 axl rose 060 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.180
 ok 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.290
 and what 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.980
 the petistas speak 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.020
 if it will be better 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.730
 sunday sunday 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.670
 the southerners arrived 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.119
 because of the graphics now i understand this 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 the nintendo wii 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 the subject is coffee with milk 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 in this story 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.550
 that's all I wanted to say I'm going to get into the fight 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.890
 too good leaving aside the vagrant evictions 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.010
 mechanized 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 I'm going to go back to Brazil here. 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.190
 Let's talk a little about the ones you indicated. 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 this beginning of conversation the last 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.160
 That's what makes it crap. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.169
 in a telegram 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.619
 no problem 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 SÃ£o Paulo is the bleeding 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.889
 videos 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 fable 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.609
 he 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.609
 O 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.589
 1 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.399
 does not handle 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.659
 no one stayed the other 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.409
 Oh my God 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.529
 I saw some videos on you tube. 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.669
 about the experienced code 4 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.639
 The 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.199
 another hindrance 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.219
 what I wanted 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.429
 the atl 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.559
 the graphics are miguel super grass the creator 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.309
 sucks 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.869
 Grandmother if you do not believe me. 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.169
 Do you think zico is good? 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 the representative and brother 4 12 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.960
 but what will happen next? 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.970
 5 the paulista would say to defend themselves 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.559
 scammer, what's this? 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.870
 the other option 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.600
 not only the heat returned we are not vandals Paul is not very broad a 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.710
 student with the grant of rent 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.080
 O 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.340
 Ah, Galp 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.340
 evil in total dead center 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.010
 the dome with the placard with the plan the agreement 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.010
 everything to the hospital 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.020
 but the last proposal 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.209
 the post-Kyoto period was a cautious 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.979
 not co-production of the cup itself will have to stay 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.230
 for the doctor prescribed 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.969
 the scoreboard and how 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.919
 You know, I even understand what happens, it's up to the trustee not to 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.719
 are operating 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.620
 which would be criticized 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.589
 theirs 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.349
 how I doing now 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.700
 I finish the married carcass I go 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.099
 Brazil 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.280
 good option to conclude I will give my opinion that not for nothing 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.909
 about this subject 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.180
 the soccer 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.719
 It's practically your home. 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.659
 do not score picking on someone 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.569
 I should have never done this movie 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.809
 It's okay that it's the first Brazilian video game 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.810
 but they could have done something more elaborate 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.810
 I thought that opportunity the mayor 2 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.110
 take care 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.219
 the zeebo 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.219
 for the same price two fishermen 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:12.650
 So 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.969
 what are you guys buying a playstation 2 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.699
 the caustic 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.749
 I choose mayors motorway 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:25.689
 and also think if they could not have done such an elaborate thing 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.360
 did not want 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.939
 because anyway 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.789
 who's going to buy a circus? 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.129
 if playstation 2 is better 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.759
 for the same price 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.759
 we 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.680
