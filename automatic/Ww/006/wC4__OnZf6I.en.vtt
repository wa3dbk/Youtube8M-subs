back of the neck that leads up to the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.490 
back of the neck that leads up to the
year<00:00:15.280> so<00:00:15.400> I'm<00:00:15.460> gonna<00:00:15.550> start<00:00:15.730> at<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.880> top<00:00:16.500> I'm

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
year so I'm gonna start at the top I'm

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.210 
year so I'm gonna start at the top I'm
gonna<00:00:17.619> curve<00:00:18.039> down<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:20.199> like<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:20.710> very

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
gonna curve down just like so very

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.490 
gonna curve down just like so very
simple<00:00:21.789> curve<00:00:22.090> from<00:00:22.449> top<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.750> bottom<00:00:22.900> this<00:00:23.350> is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
simple curve from top to bottom this is

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.960 
simple curve from top to bottom this is
from<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.800> top<00:00:24.010> of<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.189> year<00:00:24.430> down<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.850> his

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
from the top of the year down to his

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.779 
from the top of the year down to his
neck<00:00:25.180> and<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:26.500> here<00:00:26.769> I'm<00:00:26.980> gonna<00:00:27.160> curve<00:00:27.490> down

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
neck and from here I'm gonna curve down

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.060 
neck and from here I'm gonna curve down
and<00:00:28.660> stop<00:00:28.900> just<00:00:29.170> about<00:00:29.260> there<00:00:29.560> so<00:00:29.710> that's<00:00:29.949> the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
and stop just about there so that's the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.490 
and stop just about there so that's the
length<00:00:30.279> of<00:00:30.460> his<00:00:30.550> one<00:00:30.760> here<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.230> then<00:00:32.349> from

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
length of his one here and then from

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.009 
length of his one here and then from
here<00:00:32.529> I'm<00:00:32.949> gonna<00:00:33.039> come<00:00:33.219> up<00:00:33.339> a<00:00:33.429> little<00:00:33.579> bit<00:00:34.019> and

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
here I'm gonna come up a little bit and

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.579 
here I'm gonna come up a little bit and
I'm<00:00:35.079> gonna<00:00:35.199> draw<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.469> curve<00:00:36.359> like<00:00:37.359> so<00:00:37.659> okay<00:00:38.379> so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
I'm gonna draw a curve like so okay so

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.629 
I'm gonna draw a curve like so okay so
this<00:00:39.069> is<00:00:39.219> his<00:00:39.429> top<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.239> his<00:00:40.329> head<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:41.079> his<00:00:41.199> brow

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:41.639 
this is his top of his head to his brow

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
just for a little bit of highlight I

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.739 
just for a little bit of highlight I
come<00:00:51.549> up<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.819> do<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.059> opposite<00:00:52.359> side<00:00:52.569> of<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
come up and do the opposite side of the

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.209 
come up and do the opposite side of the
year<00:00:52.869> so<00:00:53.049> I<00:00:53.109> start<00:00:53.469> up<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.619> same<00:00:53.829> height<00:00:54.100> as

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219

on behind that head and I'll do the same

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.429 
on behind that head and I'll do the same
thickness<00:01:02.440> for<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> ear<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.279> the<00:01:03.339> back<00:01:03.519> right

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.620 
thickness for the ear in the back right
now<00:01:05.439> from<00:01:05.590> here<00:01:05.829> I'm<00:01:06.039> going<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.600> draw<00:01:07.600> a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
now from here I'm going to draw a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.130 
now from here I'm going to draw a
straight<00:01:08.109> line<00:01:08.579> down<00:01:09.579> across<00:01:10.329> that's<00:01:10.930> just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
straight line down across that's just

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.830 
straight line down across that's just
one<00:01:11.500> eye<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.759> then<00:01:12.939> I'll<00:01:13.030> do<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.299> bottom

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
one eye and then I'll do the bottom

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.319 
one eye and then I'll do the bottom
curve<00:01:14.619> just<00:01:15.609> like<00:01:15.820> so

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
curve just like so

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.469 
curve just like so
okay<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.679> then<00:01:17.829> slightly<00:01:18.310> over<00:01:18.609> here<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.030> put

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
okay so then slightly over here and put

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.240 
okay so then slightly over here and put
a<00:01:19.509> dot<00:01:19.719> here<00:01:19.780> that's<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.439> start<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.890> his<00:01:21.070> other

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
a dot here that's the start of his other

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.929 
a dot here that's the start of his other
eye<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.479> it'll<00:01:22.719> come<00:01:22.869> up<00:01:23.219> just<00:01:24.219> about<00:01:24.429> there

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
eye and it'll come up just about there

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.169 
eye and it'll come up just about there
don't<00:01:25.240> draw<00:01:25.479> one<00:01:25.750> straight<00:01:26.079> line<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:27.729> that

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
don't draw one straight line like that

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.060 
don't draw one straight line like that
okay<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.189> then<00:01:30.310> I'll<00:01:30.399> do<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.880> curve<00:01:32.009> show<00:01:33.009> on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
okay and then I'll do a curve show on

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.050 
okay and then I'll do a curve show on
the<00:01:33.159> bottom<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.609> the<00:01:33.700> eye<00:01:33.759> like<00:01:34.329> so<00:01:34.600> okay<00:01:35.499> now

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the bottom of the eye like so okay now

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.090 
the bottom of the eye like so okay now
with<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.149> cheek<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:38.259> very<00:01:38.439> short<00:01:38.740> gonna

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.029 
come across like that and stop there you
know<00:01:41.710> curve<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.130> back<00:01:42.310> down<00:01:42.609> to<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.679> chin

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
know curve it back down to where is chin

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.660 
know curve it back down to where is chin
is<00:01:45.390> alright<00:01:46.829> yeah<00:01:47.859> from<00:01:48.100> here<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.399> gonna<00:01:48.520> go

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
is alright yeah from here I'm gonna go

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.050 
is alright yeah from here I'm gonna go
straight<00:01:49.030> across<00:01:50.490> there's<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> chin<00:01:51.939> is

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
straight across there's this chin is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.349 
straight across there's this chin is
blocked<00:01:52.359> chin<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.049> then<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.130> curve<00:01:54.969> that

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
blocked chin and then do a curve that

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.789 
blocked chin and then do a curve that
kind<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:55.689> comes<00:01:55.869> across<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:56.469> that<00:01:56.499> very

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
kind of comes across like that very

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.800 
kind of comes across like that very
slight<00:01:57.130> curve<00:01:57.429> to<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.299> back<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.659> head

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
slight curve to the back of the head
