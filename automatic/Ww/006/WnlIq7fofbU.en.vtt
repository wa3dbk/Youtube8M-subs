00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 such guys and welcome to the gem 28.9 to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.569
 montreal on saint laurent to show 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.950
 intractable vascular particularly 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.830
 interesting today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.240
 no it's Estelle June 10 and it is the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 test used by Canadians from 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.759
 Montreal to see if their joy is in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.220
 form 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.350
 if we let go why play at most 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 high level so that one that works 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 workouts there they make parts 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260
 with the joys and to know if they have 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.769
 really a good cardiovascular it's 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 the test who chose so to make it his 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.329
 party for a good reason is that it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 happens on a treadmill and we put 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.500
 the speed is ten miles an hour and at 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 10% slope 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.100
 the speed is going very very fast and with 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 tilt 10% per year you will see 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.289
 it's particularly difficult so 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.219
 with this difficulty when it arrives 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.539
 invoices have been able to target more 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 of children the semblance of a performance 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.320
 sporty or non-provoked click on 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.250
 is not on the ice for 20 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 minutes of fall 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 we are always on the train 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.350
 to embark and disembark board or 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.930
 disembark and it looks a bit like a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.519
 minutes on the ice 2 minutes break 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 another 2 minutes the ice pocket 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.720
 so to target and intercept the 10 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 as I told you alas that moment 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 so we will try to hold the most 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 long time possible and it's going to be around 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 League means about 40 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 seconds up to three minutes for 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 the élysée club of excellence 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.810
 so that's really it if you're not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.189
 not in good physical condition 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 currently I really do not suggest 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.850
 to try tests try it out of the test - 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.500
 great like that you'll be able 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.090
 the experienced but if you're not in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.380
 good physical condition the test I 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 propose today is really for 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.360
 the club eps so you'll see but 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.940
 nan I have already tried this tesla my 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 best performance for life 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.750
 of a minute forty so to be 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.700
 able to fit on the treadmill 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.070
 for a minute 40 to 10 miles then 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.990
 10 going through these viruses to face you 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.660
 are really good to me because 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.000
 I never saw anyone with my eyes the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.730
 bape on doing so so it will be a challenge 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.670
 for you now in the video for 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.180
 members what I want to show if the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.950
 test 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.960
 how is it done with canadians 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.510
 of Montreal so instead of just by the 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.190
 test once they do it eight times with 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 two minutes breaks between each 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.340
 and cumulates the number of 1000s of a second 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.650
 total who are successful at end in total and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 he wants to be able to thousand-island standards of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.080
 the last camp evaluation 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.910
 montreal canadians so the camp 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 hamilton bulldogs 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.150
 since there is no rock is taken in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 hand so if you want to know go out 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.690

 to show you what it looks like when 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.590
 I climbed Hinduism worse and la if 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.320

 tomorrow you can try it even 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.550
 much less speed 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 because you are going to realize 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.120
