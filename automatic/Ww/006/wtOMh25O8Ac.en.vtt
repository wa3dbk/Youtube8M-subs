George Eastman House this is a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400 
George Eastman House this is a
interesting<00:00:32.400> image<00:00:32.699> because<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.300> has<00:00:33.540> figures

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
interesting image because it has figures

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.790 
interesting image because it has figures
in<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.600> blurry<00:00:37.200> almost

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
in it that are that are blurry almost

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
in it that are that are blurry almost
like<00:00:38.010> ghosts<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.149> picture<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
like ghosts in the picture and that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
like ghosts in the picture and that
occurs<00:00:40.379> because<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.010> long<00:00:41.280> exposure<00:00:41.879> does

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
occurs because the long exposure does

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
occurs because the long exposure does
not<00:00:43.050> capture<00:00:43.550> movement<00:00:44.550> anything<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> is

across the paddy conveys what Craig

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.610 
across the paddy conveys what Craig
probably<00:03:51.310> felt<00:03:51.579> as<00:03:51.819> he<00:03:52.060> was<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.689> marine<00:03:53.019> growing

probably felt as he was a marine growing
across<00:03:53.950> these<00:03:54.189> same<00:03:54.519> kinds<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.239> rice<00:03:55.420> paddies

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:05.880 
across these same kinds of rice paddies
during<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.409> Vietnam<00:03:56.799> War

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.720 

and<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:06.970> because<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.930> title<00:04:08.320> it<00:04:08.890> conveys

and so because of the title it conveys

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.450 
and so because of the title it conveys
this<00:04:10.090> eerie<00:04:11.580> sort<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.670> scary<00:04:13.210> in<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.050> way

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
this eerie sort of scary in a way

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.550 
this eerie sort of scary in a way
feeling<00:04:15.460> which<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.540> conflict<00:04:17.260> with<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
feeling which is a conflict with the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.949 
feeling which is a conflict with the
beauty<00:04:17.920> of<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.220> image<00:04:18.579> itself<00:04:18.820> there<00:04:19.810> is<00:04:19.840> a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
beauty of the image itself there is a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.520 
beauty of the image itself there is a
shadow<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.829> Craig<00:04:21.280> taking<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.240> picture<00:04:22.530> taking

just feel that yes he was here during
the<00:04:29.950> Vietnam<00:04:30.340> War<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.200> now<00:04:32.380> quiet

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
the Vietnam War and this is now quiet

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.940 
the Vietnam War and this is now quiet
and<00:04:33.250> beautiful<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:34.060> serene<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:35.440> perhaps

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
and beautiful and serene but perhaps

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.840 
and beautiful and serene but perhaps
when<00:04:36.520> he<00:04:36.550> was<00:04:36.880> there<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.450> was<00:04:38.370> totally<00:04:39.370> violent

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
when he was there it was totally violent

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:51.270 
when he was there it was totally violent
different<00:04:40.750> scene<00:04:41.790> beautiful

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.689 

Craig<00:04:52.280> actually<00:04:53.020> talks<00:04:54.020> about<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.580> reason<00:04:55.580> he

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
Craig actually talks about the reason he

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.240 
Craig actually talks about the reason he
chose<00:04:55.730> pinhole<00:04:56.449> photography<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.620> because<00:04:58.040> it

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
chose pinhole photography is because it

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.360 
chose pinhole photography is because it
is<00:04:58.370> time-consuming<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.780> long<00:05:00.410> exposures<00:05:01.130> for

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
is time-consuming the long exposures for

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.530 
is time-consuming the long exposures for
each<00:05:01.490> image<00:05:01.760> he<00:05:02.449> wanted<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:02.960> opportunity<00:05:03.290> to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
each image he wanted the opportunity to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.170 
each image he wanted the opportunity to
observe<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:06.680> countryside<00:05:07.310> while<00:05:07.669> he<00:05:08.030> was

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
observe the countryside while he was

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.810 
observe the countryside while he was
photographing<00:05:08.900> he<00:05:09.680> also<00:05:09.919> wanted<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.520> travel

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
photographing he also wanted to travel

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.740 
photographing he also wanted to travel
light<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.540> simple<00:05:11.990> box<00:05:12.669> with<00:05:13.669> no<00:05:14.000> lens<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.570> worry

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
light a simple box with no lens to worry

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.620 
light a simple box with no lens to worry
about<00:05:14.900> being<00:05:15.350> moldy<00:05:15.889> or<00:05:15.919> rained<00:05:16.610> on<00:05:16.790> and<00:05:17.090> I

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
about being moldy or rained on and I

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.170 
about being moldy or rained on and I
think<00:05:17.870> he<00:05:18.080> wanted<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.070> process<00:05:19.790> of<00:05:19.940> making

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
think he wanted the process of making

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.930 
think he wanted the process of making
the<00:05:20.479> photographs<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.440> help<00:05:22.280> his<00:05:22.490> own<00:05:22.639> healing

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
the photographs to help his own healing

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.790 
the photographs to help his own healing
of<00:05:23.360> what<00:05:24.169> he<00:05:24.290> experienced<00:05:24.770> India

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.320 

I<00:05:32.780> think<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:34.289> would<00:05:34.500> walk<00:05:34.680> away<00:05:35.090> from<00:05:36.090> this

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
I think you would walk away from this

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.040 
I think you would walk away from this
show<00:05:36.599> with<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> feeling<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.860> peace<00:05:38.960> for<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
show with a feeling of peace for the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.460 
show with a feeling of peace for the
most<00:05:40.229> part<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.509> soldier<00:05:43.319> who

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
most part that this is a soldier who

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.300 
most part that this is a soldier who
went<00:05:43.650> back<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.940> Vietnam<00:05:45.409> who<00:05:46.409> had<00:05:46.919> perhaps

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
went back to Vietnam who had perhaps

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.110 
went back to Vietnam who had perhaps
