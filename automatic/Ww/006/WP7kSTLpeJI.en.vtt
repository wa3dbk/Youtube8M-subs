and<00:04:20.070> we'll<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.700> kind<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:21.030> thing<00:04:21.209> it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.400 

well<00:04:25.930> it's<00:04:26.320> not<00:04:26.500> exactly<00:04:27.870> spot-on<00:04:28.870> but<00:04:29.169> it's

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
well it's not exactly spot-on but it's

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.850 
well it's not exactly spot-on but it's
good<00:04:29.620> enough<00:04:29.650> for<00:04:30.130> this<00:04:30.760> demonstration

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
good enough for this demonstration

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.820 
good enough for this demonstration
anyway<00:04:32.860> then<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:35.260> will<00:04:35.500> move<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.919> to<00:04:37.830> creating

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
anyway then you will move on to creating

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.900 
anyway then you will move on to creating
an<00:04:39.000> AAC<00:04:40.000> version<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:43.590> tune<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.730> click

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
an AAC version of this tune with click

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.030 
an AAC version of this tune with click
here<00:04:46.120> creates<00:04:46.600> right-click<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:47.410> select

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
here creates right-click and select

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.510 
here creates right-click and select
create<00:04:48.460> AAC<00:04:48.880> version<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:52.180> we've<00:04:53.020> done<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.430> we

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
create AAC version and we've done and we

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.300 
create AAC version and we've done and we
have<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.760> here<00:04:54.790> it's<00:04:55.060> 31<00:04:55.720> seconds

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.270 

now<00:04:59.569> you<00:05:00.569> may<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:00.720> oh<00:05:01.139> well<00:05:01.530> basically

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
anyway in order to use this as a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.250 
anyway in order to use this as a
ringtone<00:05:47.330> you<00:05:48.330> need<00:05:48.510> to<00:05:48.750> rename<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.740> file<00:05:49.980> and

ringtone you need to rename the file and

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.160 
ringtone you need to rename the file and
because<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.470> extension<00:05:53.100> needs<00:05:53.670> to<00:05:53.970> be<00:05:55.430> m4r

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
because the extension needs to be m4r

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
because the extension needs to be m4r
not<00:05:58.170> a<00:05:58.670> so<00:05:59.670> m4r<00:06:00.420> is<00:06:01.400> basically<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.550> ringtone<00:06:04.190> so

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190
