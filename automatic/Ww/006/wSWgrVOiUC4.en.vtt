but here's a picture on the seed packet

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.120 
but here's a picture on the seed packet
how<00:00:27.340> they<00:00:27.490> look<00:00:27.699> like<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:29.019> I'm<00:00:29.230> very<00:00:29.560> excited

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
as well so I remember in the Philippines

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.630 
as well so I remember in the Philippines
growing<00:00:52.900> up<00:00:53.020> there<00:00:53.260> they<00:00:53.800> pretty<00:00:54.250> much<00:00:54.400> grew

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
growing up there they pretty much grew

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.510 
growing up there they pretty much grew
wildly<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.420> it's<00:00:55.900> just<00:00:56.140> fun<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:57.370> know<00:00:57.490> I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
wildly and it's just fun to you know I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.270 
wildly and it's just fun to you know I
didn't<00:00:58.510> poke<00:00:58.660> on<00:00:58.810> I'm<00:00:58.840> just<00:00:59.110> gently<00:01:00.070> touch

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
didn't poke on I'm just gently touch

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.460 
didn't poke on I'm just gently touch
them<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:00.790> they<00:01:00.850> close<00:01:01.210> now<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.110> don't<00:01:02.350> want

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
them and they close now you don't want

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.380 
them and they close now you don't want
to<00:01:02.560> poke<00:01:02.920> at<00:01:03.130> it<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.700> know<00:01:03.850> just<00:01:04.059> be<00:01:04.150> gentle

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
to poke at it you know just be gentle

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.780 
to poke at it you know just be gentle
obviously<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.590> sensitive<00:01:06.010> plant<00:01:06.220> hence

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
obviously it's a sensitive plant hence

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.240 
obviously it's a sensitive plant hence
the<00:01:07.000> name<00:01:07.180> that<00:01:07.689> way<00:01:07.869> that's<00:01:08.439> why<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.679> closes

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
the name that way that's why it closes

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.389 
the name that way that's why it closes
so<00:01:10.000> but<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.229> neat<00:01:11.469> thing<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.859> see<00:01:12.039> an

look here in a minute how they're doing

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.910 
look here in a minute how they're doing
but<00:01:20.770> anyways<00:01:21.420> before<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.960> sow<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.380> seeds<00:01:23.710> in

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
but anyways before you sow the seeds in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.090 
but anyways before you sow the seeds in
soil<00:01:24.249> that<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:24.850> also<00:01:25.030> want<00:01:25.359> to<00:01:25.420> use<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:26.619> seed

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
soil that you also want to use a seed

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.029 
soil that you also want to use a seed
starting<00:01:27.520> mix<00:01:27.789> not<00:01:28.630> soil<00:01:29.020> from<00:01:29.289> outside

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
starting mix not soil from outside

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.499 
starting mix not soil from outside
because<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.460> don't<00:01:30.579> want<00:01:30.700> any<00:01:30.850> bacteria<00:01:31.450> or

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
because you don't want any bacteria or

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.080 
because you don't want any bacteria or
viruses<00:01:32.109> that<00:01:32.619> will<00:01:32.770> kill<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.130> seedlings<00:01:33.579> so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
viruses that will kill the seedlings so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.959 
viruses that will kill the seedlings so
I<00:01:34.149> just<00:01:34.299> bought<00:01:34.479> some<00:01:34.810> soils<00:01:35.740> soilless<00:01:36.729> or

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
I just bought some soils soilless or

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.200 
I just bought some soils soilless or
ceiling<00:01:37.600> mix<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.109> that's<00:01:38.259> what<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.409> use<00:01:38.649> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
ceiling mix and that's what I use I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.889 
ceiling mix and that's what I use I
saturated<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.840> soil<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.240> until<00:01:43.240> it's<00:01:43.359> you

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
saturated the soil and until it's you

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.599 
saturated the soil and until it's you
know<00:01:44.049> kind<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.530> foggy<00:01:44.740> before<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.369> saw<00:01:45.549> the

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
know kind of foggy before I saw the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.090 
know kind of foggy before I saw the
seeds<00:01:45.939> now<00:01:46.539> before<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.020> said<00:01:47.469> we<00:01:47.710> sowed<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
seeds now before I said we sowed the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.849 
seeds now before I said we sowed the
seeds<00:01:48.369> into<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.179> pots<00:01:49.749> we<00:01:50.350> soaked<00:01:50.679> them

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
seeds into the pots we soaked them

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.359 
seeds into the pots we soaked them
overnight<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:52.079> warm<00:01:53.079> water<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.159> actually

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
overnight in warm water and I actually

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.879 
overnight in warm water and I actually
grabbed<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:54.969> mug<00:01:55.179> we<00:01:55.630> had<00:01:55.929> then<00:01:56.350> placed<00:01:56.619> the

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
grabbed the mug we had then placed the

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.950 
grabbed the mug we had then placed the
seasoning<00:01:57.429> mug<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.240> actually<00:01:58.359> place<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
seasoning mug and I actually place the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.169 
seasoning mug and I actually place the
mug<00:01:59.139> on<00:01:59.289> top<00:01:59.499> of<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.740> heater<00:01:59.950> vent<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.850> way<00:02:01.030> the

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
mug on top of a heater vent that way the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.020 
mug on top of a heater vent that way the
water<00:02:01.299> stayed<00:02:01.719> warm<00:02:01.959> and<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:03.159> stayed<00:02:03.490> warm<00:02:03.759> -

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
water stayed warm and it stayed warm -

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.620 
water stayed warm and it stayed warm -
oh<00:02:04.060> nice<00:02:04.240> about<00:02:04.509> 70<00:02:05.139> to<00:02:05.350> 73<00:02:05.889> degrees

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
oh nice about 70 to 73 degrees

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.840 
oh nice about 70 to 73 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.920> way<00:02:09.069> you'll<00:02:09.220> help<00:02:09.580> with

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
Fahrenheit so that way you'll help with

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.790 
Fahrenheit so that way you'll help with
the<00:02:09.940> germination<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.080> after<00:02:11.380> soaking<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the germination so after soaking the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.200 
the germination so after soaking the
seeds<00:02:12.010> for<00:02:12.160> 24<00:02:12.580> hours

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
seeds for 24 hours

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.910 
seeds for 24 hours
you<00:02:13.660> sold<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.230> seeds

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
you sold the seeds

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.850 
you sold the seeds
into<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.280> soil<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.930> want<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.230> keep<00:02:17.560> them

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
into the soil and you want to keep them

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.670 
into the soil and you want to keep them
in<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.430> temperature<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:18.940> at<00:02:19.270> least<00:02:19.390> 70<00:02:20.319> degrees

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
in a temperature of at least 70 degrees

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.770 
in a temperature of at least 70 degrees
to<00:02:20.980> 85<00:02:21.370> degrees<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.730> order<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> seeds<00:02:22.720> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
to 85 degrees in order for the seeds to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.300 
to 85 degrees in order for the seeds to
germinate<00:02:22.870> properly<00:02:23.410> since<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.280> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
germinate properly since it is a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.500 
germinate properly since it is a
tropical<00:02:24.550> plant<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.370> recycled<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.489> box<00:02:27.730> my

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
tropical plant now I recycled a box my

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.840 
tropical plant now I recycled a box my
son<00:02:28.840> got<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:30.239> swing<00:02:31.239> for<00:02:31.450> Christmas<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.319> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
son got this swing for Christmas and I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.610 
son got this swing for Christmas and I
looked<00:02:33.850> at<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> saw<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.750> box<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.440> thought

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
looked at I saw this box and I thought

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.760 
looked at I saw this box and I thought
that<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:35.950> perfect<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.209> little<00:02:37.770> DIY

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
that was perfect for a little DIY

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.070 
that was perfect for a little DIY
miniature<00:02:39.489> greenhouse<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:40.780> got<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
miniature greenhouse so it's got the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.690 
miniature greenhouse so it's got the
plastic<00:02:41.200> already<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.040> you'll<00:02:42.190> let<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> Sun

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
plastic already so you'll let the Sun

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.550 
plastic already so you'll let the Sun
the<00:02:43.180> sunlight<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.750> if<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.019> not<00:02:44.050> using<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the sunlight and if I'm not using the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
the sunlight and if I'm not using the
scene<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.980> bulb<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.519> inserted<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.510> there

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
scene of a bulb that I inserted in there

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.840 
scene of a bulb that I inserted in there
and<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.739> guess<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:48.220> went<00:02:48.400> ahead<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.730> just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and I guess going went ahead and just

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.870 
and I guess going went ahead and just
cut<00:02:49.330> out<00:02:49.420> some<00:02:49.569> holes<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.250> both<00:02:51.250> sides<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
cut out some holes on both sides of the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.449 
cut out some holes on both sides of the
box<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.690> air<00:02:53.230> ventilation<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.190> nothing

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
box just for air ventilation so nothing

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.699 
box just for air ventilation so nothing
gets<00:02:54.549> moldy<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.140> actually<00:02:56.440> worked<00:02:56.620> out

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
gets moldy so it actually worked out

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.120 
gets moldy so it actually worked out
perfectly<00:02:57.100> now<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.330> got<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.290> idea<00:02:59.470> from<00:02:59.860> ray

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
perfectly now I got this idea from ray

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.070 
perfectly now I got this idea from ray
from<00:03:00.430> practice<00:03:00.790> five<00:03:00.970> five<00:03:01.180> seven<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:01.510> two<00:03:01.630> I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
from practice five five seven one two I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.220 
from practice five five seven one two I
think<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.860> was<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> few<00:03:03.100> years<00:03:03.310> back<00:03:03.519> he<00:03:03.730> made

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
think it was a few years back he made

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.020 
think it was a few years back he made
another<00:03:05.230> grow<00:03:05.560> box<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.160> from<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.760> normal

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
another grow box and from a normal

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.750 
another grow box and from a normal
cardboard<00:03:07.450> box<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.989> he<00:03:08.980> inserted<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.610> yeah

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
cardboard box and he inserted that yeah

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.449 
cardboard box and he inserted that yeah
CFL<00:03:10.600> bulb<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.959> there<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.130> kind<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.310> like

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
CFL bulb in there so it's kind of like

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.940 
CFL bulb in there so it's kind of like
the<00:03:12.549> same<00:03:12.760> idea<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.780> he's<00:03:14.590> got<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.799> lot<00:03:14.920> of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the same idea so he's got a lot of

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.100 
the same idea so he's got a lot of
awesome<00:03:15.730> videos<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.090> awesome<00:03:16.690> tips<00:03:16.930> about

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
awesome videos and awesome tips about

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.860 
awesome videos and awesome tips about
gardening<00:03:17.470> as<00:03:17.590> well<00:03:17.769> right<00:03:18.310> away<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:19.420> anyways

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
gardening as well right away but anyways

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.380 
gardening as well right away but anyways
so<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.320> works<00:03:20.530> out<00:03:20.680> perfectly<00:03:21.070> we<00:03:22.000> keep<00:03:22.239> this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
so this works out perfectly we keep this

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.750 
so this works out perfectly we keep this
box<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.959> my<00:03:23.140> son's<00:03:23.380> bedroom<00:03:23.590> it's<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.400> warmest

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
box in my son's bedroom it's the warmest

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.240 
box in my son's bedroom it's the warmest
bedroom<00:03:25.570> in<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> house<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.320> guess<00:03:26.799> got<00:03:27.160> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
bedroom in the house I guess got the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.030 
bedroom in the house I guess got the
best<00:03:27.430> insulation<00:03:28.150> but<00:03:28.660> usually<00:03:29.620> stays<00:03:29.859> in

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
best insulation but usually stays in

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.690 
best insulation but usually stays in
there<00:03:30.220> about<00:03:31.180> 72<00:03:31.810> degrees<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.350> 74<00:03:32.829> degrees<00:03:33.160> so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
there about 72 degrees to 74 degrees so

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.420 
there about 72 degrees to 74 degrees so
they<00:03:34.150> need<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.630> heat<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.560> order<00:03:35.680> them<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
they need the heat so in order them to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.370 
they need the heat so in order them to
thrive<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.000> germinate<00:03:37.540> now<00:03:37.930> give<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.350> a

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
thrive and germinate now give you a

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.530 
thrive and germinate now give you a
closer<00:03:38.620> look<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.250> how<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:40.000> see<00:03:40.209> things<00:03:40.420> are

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
closer look and how that see things are

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.310 
closer look and how that see things are
doing<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:41.380> assume<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.859> here<00:03:42.070> for<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.340> guys

doing just assume in here for you guys

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.810 
doing just assume in here for you guys
so<00:03:44.320> these<00:03:44.590> are<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.070> initial<00:03:45.370> leaves

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
so these are the initial leaves

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.330 
so these are the initial leaves
eventually<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.260> second<00:03:47.709> set<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:47.859> leaves<00:03:47.950> are

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
eventually the second set of leaves are

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.110 
eventually the second set of leaves are
going<00:03:48.609> to<00:03:48.730> emerge<00:03:49.120> as<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
going to emerge as you can see on to the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.150 
going to emerge as you can see on to the
right<00:03:52.540> side<00:03:52.840> here<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.410> see<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.829> can<00:03:53.980> see

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
right side here to see then you can see

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.410 
right side here to see then you can see
the<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:55.570> leaves<00:03:55.900> coming<00:03:56.320> out<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> think

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
the little leaves coming out so I think

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.500 
the little leaves coming out so I think
they're<00:03:58.810> doing<00:03:59.170> pretty<00:03:59.440> well<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.510> they

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
they're doing pretty well and they

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.080 
they're doing pretty well and they
actually<00:04:01.900> started<00:04:02.230> germinating<00:04:03.010> after<00:04:03.489> just

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
actually started germinating after just

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.680 
actually started germinating after just
three<00:04:04.209> days<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:05.560> sowing<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.040> seeds<00:04:06.310> we<00:04:06.459> saw

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
three days of sowing the seeds we saw

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.009 
three days of sowing the seeds we saw
the<00:04:07.690> little<00:04:07.959> tiny<00:04:08.590> stem<00:04:09.010> popping<00:04:09.579> out<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.750> so

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
the little tiny stem popping out and so

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.479 
the little tiny stem popping out and so
it's<00:04:11.139> been<00:04:11.260> about<00:04:11.350> seven<00:04:11.650> days<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.340> we're

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489
