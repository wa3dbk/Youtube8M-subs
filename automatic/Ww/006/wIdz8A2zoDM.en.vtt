anywhere<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.750> indie<00:02:11.350> sounds<00:02:11.710> it's<00:02:12.450> 12:30<00:02:13.450> at

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
anywhere so indie sounds it's 12:30 at

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.630 
anywhere so indie sounds it's 12:30 at
night<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:14.080> doubt<00:02:14.350> anyone<00:02:14.830> will<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.459> me

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
night I doubt anyone will be up with me

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.400 
night I doubt anyone will be up with me
so<00:02:16.320> okay<00:02:17.320> go<00:02:17.560> down<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:18.270> system<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.990> we're

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
so okay go down to system and we're

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.300 
so okay go down to system and we're
going<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> go<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.940> HDMI<00:02:22.830> device<00:02:23.830> link

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
going to go to HDMI device link

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.830 
going to go to HDMI device link
basically<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.959> some<00:02:26.260> sort<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:27.360> program<00:02:28.360> or

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
basically it's some sort of program or

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.910 
basically it's some sort of program or
like<00:02:29.020> thing<00:02:29.470> that's<00:02:29.950> built<00:02:30.400> into<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.920> HDTV

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
like thing that's built into the HDTV

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390 
like thing that's built into the HDTV
that<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:35.020> uses<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.739> signal<00:02:36.250> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
that you have it uses the signal that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.510 
that you have it uses the signal that
comes<00:02:36.640> from<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.090> IR<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.959> think<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:38.920> called<00:02:39.190> IR

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
comes from the IR I think it's called IR

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.790 
comes from the IR I think it's called IR
the<00:02:40.120> signal<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.660> gets<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:41.140> transmitted

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the signal that gets from transmitted

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.330 
the signal that gets from transmitted
from<00:02:41.950> your<00:02:42.190> controller<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.440> receiver<00:02:44.950> on

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
from your controller to the receiver on

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.449 
from your controller to the receiver on
the<00:02:45.550> TV<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:47.050> what<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> does<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the TV and what that does is that and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.000 
the TV and what that does is that and
then<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.760> some<00:02:49.600> time<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.080> does<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.650> some<00:02:50.800> sort

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
then it some time it does like some sort

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.710 
then it some time it does like some sort
of<00:02:51.040> encoding<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> sends<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> through

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
of encoding and it sends it through

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.580 
of encoding and it sends it through
the<00:02:53.260> HDMI<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.850> PlayStation<00:02:55.480> 4<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.900> then

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the HDMI to the PlayStation 4 and then

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.039 
the HDMI to the PlayStation 4 and then
the<00:02:56.709> PlayStation<00:02:57.280> 4<00:02:57.310> does<00:02:58.269> its<00:02:58.480> thing<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
the PlayStation 4 does its thing and

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.340 
the PlayStation 4 does its thing and
makes<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.220> coding<00:03:01.090> into<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.690> some<00:03:01.930> sort<00:03:02.230> of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
makes that coding into like some sort of

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.449 
makes that coding into like some sort of
like<00:03:02.650> signal<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.900> basically<00:03:05.459> sends

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
like signal and it it basically sends

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.210 
like signal and it it basically sends
this<00:03:06.640> signal<00:03:07.150> from<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.600> TV<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.709> just

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
this signal from the TV and just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.620 
this signal from the TV and just
basically<00:03:09.730> lets<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.150> control<00:03:10.450> your

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
basically lets you control your

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.370 
basically lets you control your
PlayStation<00:03:11.260> 4<00:03:11.500> with<00:03:12.750> what<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:13.840> hearing<00:03:14.230> is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
