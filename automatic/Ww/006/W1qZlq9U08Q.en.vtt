00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.719
 The 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.360
 In my experience 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.570
 Oh, when multiplied by the sudden braking 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.200
 I'm going to speed threatening when I turn around the corner 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 Whether the bicycle is what kind of movement 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.420
 The accident that occurred because I did not know properly 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 There are many 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.570
 I 'll remember from now on because I'm going to experiment 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.600
 me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.600
 2 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:47.840
 At first, when we applied both the front and rear brakes 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:52.990
 How long will it take you to stop and apply the brake after noticing danger ? 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.990
 First of all, on a bicycle running at normal speed 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.340
 2 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.340
 It stopped at about 3 meters and 40 centimeters 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.990
 But I 'm told 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 Even if I put on the brake, I wo n't get it right away 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 Suddenly Stop not pedestrians and bicycle and has issued a spade because 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.430
 There is a risk of hitting a car 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.140
 me 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 goo 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.679
 What happens is pre-party and in applying the only brake before on the right side of the handle 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 There is also a great risk of falling and being overwhelmed by speeding up. 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.770
 Oh 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.260
 Next I will try only the gray machine behind 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.070
 There is a risk that the rear tires will slip and fall while speeding up 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:20.230
 So it is important to apply the brakes in a balanced manner 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.230
 I If you do not care to put too much speed at the same 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:38.680
 Next I will do an experiment when I turn the corner 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.680
 If you turn the corner at a slow speed, you can turn in a small circle. 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:52.329
 But when it bends with speed , it will swell greatly 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.329
 It's become very accident When there comes a car or motorcycle 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.760
 So it's important to turn at a lower speed before turning around the corner 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.670
 The last is an experiment when the car suddenly brakes 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.670
 Sudden braking at 50 km / h 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.770
 The distance from the brake to the trouble was about 9 meters 70 centimeters 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.870
 That means if you jump out with a sudden turn change or pause violation 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.870
 Follow 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.200
 The car can not stop suddenly 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.200
 Various experiment days 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.310
 I know that I can not shut my bicycle or car suddenly 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.220
 So 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.330
 Pause violation place human course change something good 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.330
 First of all
