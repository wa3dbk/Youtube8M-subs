color of the of each LED will be

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.880 
color of the of each LED will be
different<00:01:51.220> because<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.000> wheel<00:01:52.890> because

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
different because of the wheel because

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.770 
different because of the wheel because
the<00:01:54.130> wheel<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.460> set<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.910> middle<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.479> I'll

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
the wheel is set in the middle and I'll

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:08.130 
the wheel is set in the middle and I'll
show<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.020> once<00:01:56.380> we<00:01:56.590> turn<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.040> okay<00:02:07.020> plug<00:02:08.020> it

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
show you once we turn it on okay plug it

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.220 
show you once we turn it on okay plug it
back<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:09.360> turn<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:14.050> you'll<00:02:14.170> notice

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.070 
back in turn it on and if you'll notice
as<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.850> wheel<00:02:16.030> rotates<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:16.870> two

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
as the wheel rotates you have two

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
as the wheel rotates you have two
different<00:02:17.230> colors<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:18.100> because<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.880> wheel

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
different colors it's because the wheel

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.900 
different colors it's because the wheel
is<00:02:19.420> set<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.680> middle<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.130> you've<00:02:21.520> got<00:02:21.700> each

is set in the middle and you've got each

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.040 
is set in the middle and you've got each
LED<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.570> each<00:02:22.750> side<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:25.959> you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
LED on each side and that's how you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.680 
LED on each side and that's how you
change<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.410> wheel<00:02:26.560> thank<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> very<00:02:27.070> much
