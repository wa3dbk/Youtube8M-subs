 very important things in this without 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.959
 solution the t4 that clearly then 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.090
 the best speed in mobility and it was 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.910
 an 8 megapixel camera with sensor 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.970

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.140
 then megapixels basics 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.140
 quality to video calls 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.980
 openly integrating the world 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.560
 networker and the applications of

 internally you have your product and also 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.150
 from an application where we can record 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.040

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.939
 pencil and any 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.650
 then cierval has implemented 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.040
 so I do not have to use in the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.230
 styles that is already in the kitchen in 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.379
 box in to the conception of the product a 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.560
 special experience and good I think that 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.420
 really this is a product that can 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.280
 make a difference in the experience 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.940
 that we already have we have smartphone in a 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.350
 ideal free tablet PCs 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.220
 let's talk now about the bluetooth 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.600
 headset the bluetooth headset is called 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.030
 it's called smh 62 and you have good 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.270
 first you have one transmitted now in 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.930
 we will see the center 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.800
 and this also you have it then good 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.950
 the tricks and I already compared myself we 're going to 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.390
 repeat the operation 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:04.489
 and the association is going to share with me 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.930
 automatically I associate it and already what 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.480
 I can connect directly and useable 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.470
 then it may be made more 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.919
 simple the connection between the two and 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:25.440
 no that this is a headset that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:27.880
 has an integrated headset included and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.110
 the work is not and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.650
 hd microphone or is because of the noise by 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.750
 develop the noise of the rumor 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.750
