00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:16.260
 careful today let's see how to do it the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.740
 the world's easiest elevator 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.520
 this is very basic very easy a little 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.520
 economic let's look at how it works 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.670
 well 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:48.990
 If it's cheap then you have to have a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.990
 little effort to get down is nothing more 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.570
 we already have like 0 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.989
 first three squares this will be two 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.989
 floors 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.680
 You can do another class as you want 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140
 to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 first put on a ladder staircase 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.460
 here they put 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.690
 put a rail on the railcar 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.470
 and without it moving in the square 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.470
 during the first day master so 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 how to get off there 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.400
 i 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.530
 with 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.700
 roses 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.280
 they put a square 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.280
 a dragon king 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.900
 now 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.950
 and that's it 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.580
 one 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.810
 very simple economical can repeat it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.810
 how many times do you want 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.680
 I do not know why it gets off and stops 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.099
 function 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.099
 i 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.090
 Well that's it 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.990
 thanks for watching the video on how to do 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.990
 a very simple elevator 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.730
