00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.129
 ready and the cellar lid has been removed and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.290
 here we are saying work 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.960
 cullens 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.299
 the schools that are working here 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.360
 they are part of the cooling kit 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.970
 then the electric term sharing it 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.980
 there refrigerate from the inside and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.860
 heat here from the outside 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.830
 and these serve curry back they serve 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.580
 to cool this part that is 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.790
 heated and here we have the plate 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.790
 electronics 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.300
 Almost all wineries have this 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.180
 same model the good-looking model here 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.270
 Are you seeing green led on who? 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.010
 indicates that there is cooling and the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.020
 red LED indicates that the equipment 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.540
 plugged in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.150
 it is this first socket that a movie in 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.700
 black 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.220
 it is a sensor socket is 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.850
 temperature that is within the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.180
 He then dissipated by controlling the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.030
 and receives and sends information from 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.780
 temperature and if others what had three 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.000
 children 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.360
 where there is a red one a black and one 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.970
 white is the control board 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.650
 command from the front where you indicate which 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.100
 The temperature you want 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.380
 already in itself yellow with black is the cooler 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 inside that's cool 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.570
 internally in the cellar 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.010
 these last two are from outside then not 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.040
 You can lose yourself 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.729
 When you take those out, just take a 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.860
 Photograph 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.570
 before taking the children away from the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.909
 it will be very easy for you not to 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.510
 lose during assembly when you 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.350
 receiving the card again is already 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.810
 board of directors has done more than 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.820
 to send the power board here is the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.340
 which I call the font board 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.350
 sometimes it is necessary to send a kit of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.379
 only removes the necklaces and I 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.629
 sends the sinks because there are times when 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.960
 that the thermoelectric pellet is also 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.020
 broked 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.090
 the need for repair there are four 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.090
 here screw a guy like that 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.110
 sinks then you remove is that the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.700
 sinks the fans and here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 inside has two screws 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.530
 here you can see a screw of this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.870
 side and has a screw on that side here 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.170
 which is where you let go of the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.170
 wine House
