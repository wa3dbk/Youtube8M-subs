00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
the chart below the video to figure out

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.950 
the chart below the video to figure out
exactly<00:00:41.589> what<00:00:42.039> size<00:00:42.429> your<00:00:43.239> musician<00:00:43.749> needs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.569 

after<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.079> have<00:00:47.199> figured<00:00:47.679> out<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.979> size<00:00:48.190> it

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
after you have figured out the size it

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.119 
after you have figured out the size it
is<00:00:48.819> best<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.239> use<00:00:49.390> an<00:00:49.510> actual<00:00:49.780> instrument<00:00:50.530> to

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
is best to use an actual instrument to

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.189 
is best to use an actual instrument to
double-check<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.269> you<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.050> right

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
double-check that you have the right

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.319 
double-check that you have the right
size<00:00:53.440> so<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.309> have<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.519> full<00:00:54.760> size<00:00:54.940> violin

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
size so here I have a full size violin

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.059 
size so here I have a full size violin
again<00:00:55.929> I'm<00:00:56.079> gonna<00:00:56.260> have<00:00:56.440> Tyler<00:00:56.739> stand<00:00:56.979> up

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.069 
again I'm gonna have Tyler stand up

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:58.770 
again I'm gonna have Tyler stand up
straight<00:00:57.309> with<00:00:57.399> his<00:00:57.550> arms<00:00:57.789> straight<00:00:57.969> out<00:00:57.999> but

for the instrument on his shoulder the
scroll<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:01.870> instrument<00:01:02.379> should<00:01:03.100> be<00:01:03.280> at

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
scroll of the instrument should be at

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.410 
scroll of the instrument should be at

it's<00:01:07.600> over<00:01:08.050> as<00:01:08.170> palm<00:01:08.470> if<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.920> instrument<00:01:09.220> is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
it's over as palm if the instrument is

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's over as palm if the instrument is
too<00:01:09.730> large

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
too large

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.499 
too large
you<00:01:11.950> can<00:01:12.159> use<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.430> same<00:01:12.670> measuring<00:01:13.060> technique

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
you can use the same measuring technique

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.740 
you can use the same measuring technique
for<00:01:13.960> cello<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.380> bass<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.549> is<00:01:15.729> again<00:01:16.210> better

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750
