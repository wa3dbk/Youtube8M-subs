00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.379
 hello youtube friends we are here another 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.379
 once in the canal of panama oropesa 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.630
 now I'm in a how-to tutorial 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.119
 fix the summer 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.169
 a big problem or error you get 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.910
 commonly in the context of 1.6 though 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.110
 you have already I have this war zone in 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.870
 a previous video in a previous video 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.879
 teach how to spray tea face 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.309
 that took the first time that what 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.220
 download I got that error then 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.580
 I had to find the solution to each 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.770
 solution the error is that when you open 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.770
 the goal of strike 7 closes 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.640
 automatically automatic as well as that 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.510
 it opens and suddenly closes you but not 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.850
 it opens completely this an error of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 export by then so that it does not 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.400
 speak because there will not be for us to stop 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 normally from the control panel 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 the control panel 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.000
 and with a small system 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.430
 let's go topic advanced configuration of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.100
 system 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.920
 let's in the visual effect performance of 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 Processor programming 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.050
 use of virtual memory configuration 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.860
 data mutation prevention 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.670
 I come as I have it have some of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.170
 pigs of some games there then there are 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.170

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.319
 remove remove and we go for the 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.319
 counter strike 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.370
