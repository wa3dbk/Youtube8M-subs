build their own modes with their own
rules<00:03:10.300> for<00:03:11.300> example<00:03:11.810> let's<00:03:12.230> build<00:03:12.530> a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
rules for example let's build a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.410 
rules for example let's build a

free-for-all game where you hunt down
targets<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.470> let's<00:03:15.710> add<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.860> twist<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.460> say

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060

the only weapons are allowed to use or

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
the only weapons are allowed to use or
guns<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.580> let's<00:03:22.910> simplify<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.480> scoring

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.170 
guns and let's simplify the scoring
system<00:03:24.110> too<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> only<00:03:25.550> get<00:03:25.790> points<00:03:26.120> for

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
system too so you only get points for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.690 
system too so you only get points for
the<00:03:26.360> targets<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.840> kill

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420 

and<00:03:29.879> there<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.230> built<00:03:31.470> our<00:03:31.620> own<00:03:31.800> mode<00:03:32.099> to
