00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello my name is zabolotskaya 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.330
 Catherine I want to share with you one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 a little secret in the manufacture will give 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.330
 and from the approximate hryvnia when modeling flowers I 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 I use that such a homemade stack 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.539
 and now I will show how I did it for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 we will need this 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 toothpick bead bead and choose 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.530
 of the size you like them 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.850
 from which itâ€™s more convenient for them to work and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.750
 small 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 bead we also need glue and 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 so from two sides of the toothpick we are with you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 glue the beads apply glue to the amount 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.590
 toothpick 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.310
 and fasten the bead hold several 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.250
 seconds to let our glue dry up 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.380
 attention if I use a bead 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.090
 cheap plastic if there is 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.300
 some irregularities here can 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.160
 fix with sandpaper either 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.720
 neatly cut with a knife but stationery 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.040
 the main thing that the surface was here 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.290
 smooth because whenever he 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.520
 roll petals so that we donâ€™t 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 there were bumps ugly and with 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 the other side also 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 we smear glue on a toothpick for the sum 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.190
 glue beads 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.280
 excess adhesive that we have with you over 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 goose can not clean up 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.050
 Principle not in work will not disturb us 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.350
 we will be disturbed only if something 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.940
 the excess will be right here right here right here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:02.070
 we have no glue with you waiting for drying 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:05.280
 full and when the glue is already dry nippers 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.009
 we cut off the unnecessary tip as I have you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.860
 spoke and to have straight noses up 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.670
 so nippers with you not exactly turned 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.040
 then cut off with a stationery knife 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:27.270
 all this is served quietly at home 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:30.590
 conditions here so we remove with you 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.459
 so we have turned out with you here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.600
 it says everything ingenious is just looking 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.880
 simple things near you which 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360
 help you branches and use them your
