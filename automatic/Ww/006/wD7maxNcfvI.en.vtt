00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
didn't really believe in myself enough

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
didn't really believe in myself enough
and<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> didn't<00:01:12.960> follow<00:01:13.140> through<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.860> let's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and I didn't follow through it so let's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:58.720 
and I didn't follow through it so let's
once<00:01:14.250> again

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.960 

so<00:01:59.930> what<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.080> we<00:02:01.230> learned<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.970> we've

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
so what have we learned here we've

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.650 
so what have we learned here we've
learned<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.729> breaking<00:02:06.180> wood<00:02:06.360> over<00:02:06.540> your

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
learned that the breaking wood over your

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.560 
learned that the breaking wood over your
head<00:02:06.900> maybe<00:02:07.290> isn't<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.890> easy<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:09.060> originally

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
head maybe isn't as easy as I originally

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.880 
head maybe isn't as easy as I originally
thought<00:02:09.630> but<00:02:10.820> maybe<00:02:11.820> yeah<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.860> tried<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
thought but maybe yeah I tried a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:41.220 
thought but maybe yeah I tried a
different<00:02:14.400> piece<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.700> wood

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.290 

it's<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.920> bent<00:02:42.130> but<00:02:43.770> yeah<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:46.650> did<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:48.300> it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
it's kind of bent but yeah I did it it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.070 
it's kind of bent but yeah I did it it
only<00:02:49.420> took<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:50.819> 20<00:02:51.819> or<00:02:51.940> 30<00:02:52.209> tries<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
only took like 20 or 30 tries but the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.300 
only took like 20 or 30 tries but the
point<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.709> did<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.870> didn't<00:02:55.870> give<00:02:55.990> up

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
point is that I did it I didn't give up

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
point is that I did it I didn't give up
even<00:02:57.310> when<00:02:57.400> my<00:02:57.550> head<00:02:57.760> was<00:02:57.790> throbbing<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.660> kept

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
even when my head was throbbing I kept

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.120 
even when my head was throbbing I kept
on<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.770> it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
on with it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.180 
on with it
and<00:03:00.690> that's<00:03:01.690> that's<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.470> lesson<00:03:02.740> for<00:03:03.040> you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and that's that's the lesson for you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.290 
and that's that's the lesson for you
here<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.610> do<00:03:04.180> not<00:03:04.330> give<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:07.060> follow

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
here is do not give up and to follow

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.020 
here is do not give up and to follow
through<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:07.780> things
