00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.210
 dominate space 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.660
 Today we will have a review on lego star 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.260
 wars 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 art de tu exclusive set 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.500
 and in general, yes I brought it from 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.869
 Germany somewhere about two years ago so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 let's start here we only go on 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.210
 minifigure is such a nakida 2 to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 show what is the size of a small figure 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 rd2 saving with you big model like 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.059
 you see very huge this one on it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.420
 Tornado 2 so perhaps we begin with these 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.170
 here we have the way here is this sticker 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.960
 type of stand under 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 under it here in general that is written everything 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.840
 about this island mechanical droid 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.840
 or astromech droid but we will be so 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 it is said more correctly so the court is spelled 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.710
 what model what height what does he have 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 there is a holographic ment ebb 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 He then saw a projector by the way where 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.970
 then it is there you can open it is not it is not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 beer 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 here is a saw by the way, and there are in my back 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.820
 there is some kind of lever 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.250
 which are activated let's see yes that's 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 that's saw 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.579
 they didn't lie to us 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 ie saw a horde of up to 2 is also there 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:46.110
 so in general, the whole is written about him 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.100
 that's small from 2 to 2 on think you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.320
 everyone saw him 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:58.280
 so here it is and so let's go 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.970
 apologize to our model let's start 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.010
 from the legs then there is a lower angle 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.130
 I liked the design very much 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.959
 great did this hell to 2 here u 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.820
 he has many also can not 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.890
 get out a little bit like this it's not on 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.690
 Lego Technician Details 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.090
 the technician is required as well here and pipes 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.840
 I do not know the wire 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.510
 some generators on and apparently 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.580
 let's find and these legs by the way are identical from 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:43.720
 200 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:43.720
 so come a higher degree leg 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.540
 this design also put here detail 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.230
 from the holy ball moves like this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.620
 design and they are identical on both sides and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.170
 so now here is so spinning 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.880
 don't know about the propeller but not the propeller 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.230
 it's probably also a kind of design 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.440
 did something so here too design and 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.910
 there are two opening doors with 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.170
 which you can turn it from behind 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.049
 controls how you know it from him 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.670
 such a bottle opener he had this door 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.690
 thing tore so inserted 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.090
 and there something twisted and in that way 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 opened the door and helped his friends 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.470
 further here we were such she moves 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.440
 so basically just spinning behind 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.299
 to remove just turn in 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.980
 the opposite side and they are with us 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.560
 cleaned up 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:55.720
 so here we have this type of design circle 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:04:00.049
 and so every other head 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:06.110
 although not the same yet head yet while I am you 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:09.010
 show this here is the set function you know 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.560
 war 2 2 could also open these two 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.950
 gizmo here so here it is so here 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.310
 peeking out and it was by the way resting on 360 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.900
 degrees and there just see gold 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.900
 all sorts of items for jewelry 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.169
 his legs look like this I don't even know what 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.430
 it and so 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:41.270
 or head to our Ardvi d2 our taverns 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:51.080
 nice little so cool because memory is 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:54.530
 nonsense and so poops have us design it 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.630
 the touchlight still some long 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.539
 eye I just don't know how it all 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.560
 name and he has a 360 degree head 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:07.510
 and also in the back as you see on the design 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.389
 worked here whale spotlight and 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.840
 spinning 360 degrees and so here it is 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.889
 so we collected it very difficult for me then 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.669
 one of the years was 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:27.700
 I collected it collected his zenith although it 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:34.060
 like but still masculine android 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.060
 so now i'll show you what's behind us 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.599
 here's how everything looks back from us too 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.810
 very symmetrical and beautifully made 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.270
 by the way here i controlled the saw and 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.470
 here I do not know what he opens the door 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.820
 also here he has a third leg 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:06:02.210
 Movie question omit here yes here you are 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:05.870
 omit and 3 guesses and I think he still 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.919
 can do like this 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:16.460
 the most important thing and I already forgot how everything 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:19.190
 being done so how are you him so we him 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:25.430
 We can lift here and so aside 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:33.800
 those legs are back and so nothing 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:36.550
 it turns out so well what kind of nonsense are you so 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.050
 But in general, he has a third leg so 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.190
 taken out 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.720
 I think he can still somehow become 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.550
 rack so she was straight 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.340
 poured details oh god everything falls out 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:07:06.319
 friends do not even know where to mount 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:07:08.870
 and so that this foot inside us so 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:13.460
 so that we put this foot inside we 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:15.710
 just take and then raise up and leg 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.130
 there we put everything in there of course 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.830
 inside the mechanisms and done and everything is there 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.259
 certainly not symmetrical and ugly 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:28.130
 when I collected I saw it all but 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:32.659
 I think it will not disassemble the hour and so 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:36.680
 That's all for an exclusive review. 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:39.830
 r22 collectible model myself was me 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.960
 domino the space and by the way it's all me 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.690
 filmed on an improvised state here 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.690
 why he fell at me and therefore why I 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.090
 I take off in general all thanks to all 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.830
 view post likes and comments 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.830
 good luck everyone all bye
