00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that deserves to qualify but at the same

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.060 
that deserves to qualify but at the same
time<00:01:11.840> actually<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.140> probably<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
time actually this was probably one of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.929

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
shocked me to say that but I'd probably

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
shocked me to say that but I'd probably
pop<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:21.119> after<00:01:21.509> genealogy<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> yeah
