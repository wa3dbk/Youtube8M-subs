00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.450
 nor the expense with the staff to come fast 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.939
 today that in fact this is just a video the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.750
 kind of a reminder to you that state 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.329
 You must do what many people do. 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.760
 fishing but do not worry about the sun 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.739
 protect them from the sun and then 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.050
 bring more serious consequences 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.640
 so I do not even need to talk about her a lot 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.340
 it was more or less a summary that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.500
 What I'm going to say, you need a base that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.240
 you need to protect yourself from the sun 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
 is giving a fishing sector can 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.930
 intervene where they stay all day for the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.930
 sun is a sunscreen 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.380
 I use this one, it's 50 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:19.310
 So you can also put what you want 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.860
 You want to use it until 30 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.229
 it works cool the 50 only scored head 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.780
 of the board said 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.780
 also has lip balm too 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.799
 I 'm doing a non-league show. 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.520
 more engineers want to enjoy the people 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.890
 It's time to go there and there's a way. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.190
 lip balm 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 ok that 's a sunscreen paper 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.960
 You can only do the side 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.189
 also has from now opens uses 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.229
 it is crowded in the fishery 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.390
 you use in the neck that you avoid 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.810
 be getting too much sun on his neck that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.950
 The whole thing is inclusive of me 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.950
 I even want to point out to you here 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:49.170
 excellent brand material on the market but 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:51.090
 this brand I know you can use 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.670
 getting too much sun on the head and 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.620
 stay with your head hot then 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 also it helps a lot also protect 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.170
 Okay, so it 's the basics that you 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.150
 need 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.880

 with material then coming down and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:35.220
 Such rottenness is the basic 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:37.620
 It 's okay for us to lace one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.769
