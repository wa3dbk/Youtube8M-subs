the reason for that guy so the team gets

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
the reason for that guy so the team gets
100<00:00:25.710> chemistry<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.000> wondering<00:00:27.180> why

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
100 chemistry so if you're wondering why

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.060 
100 chemistry so if you're wondering why
I<00:00:27.510> haven't<00:00:27.720> included<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.349> Mona<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> players

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it's most likely because of the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
it's most likely because of the
chemistry<00:00:31.050> reasons<00:00:31.470> anyways<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> deceive
