get<00:00:46.160> started<00:00:52.570> I'm<00:00:53.570> at<00:00:53.690> hdil<00:00:54.140> why<00:00:54.500> would<00:00:54.800> I<00:00:55.809> make

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
get started I'm at hdil why would I make

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.840 
get started I'm at hdil why would I make
a<00:00:56.870> little<00:00:57.230> bit<00:00:57.320> wider<00:00:57.620> but<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.280> guess<00:00:58.670> it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
a little bit wider but I guess it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.040 
a little bit wider but I guess it
doesn't<00:00:59.059> know<00:01:00.340> fine<00:01:01.390> jumping<00:01:02.390> i<00:01:02.540> think<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:02.899> the

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
doesn't know fine jumping i think is the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.600 
doesn't know fine jumping i think is the
only<00:01:03.260> thing<00:01:03.770> that<00:01:04.549> really<00:01:06.130> really<00:01:07.130> makes<00:01:07.460> it

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
only thing that really really makes it

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.940 
only thing that really really makes it
weird<00:01:09.189> sometimes<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:10.639> hard<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.060> get<00:01:11.179> off<00:01:11.950> the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
weird sometimes it's hard to get off the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.919 
weird sometimes it's hard to get off the
dough<00:01:13.189> can<00:01:13.459> now<00:01:13.759> give<00:01:14.149> it<00:01:14.179> i'm<00:01:14.509> playing<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
dough can now give it i'm playing a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:24.760 
dough can now give it i'm playing a
little<00:01:15.049> bit<00:01:15.350> weird<00:01:21.579> see<00:01:22.579> sometimes<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.649> got<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.199 
little bit weird see sometimes I got to
work<00:01:24.859> with<00:01:24.920> practice<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.939> think<00:01:26.119> it's

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
work with practice and I think it's

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:27.459

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
of hard to pull off in a pinch if i was

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.379 
of hard to pull off in a pinch if i was
playing<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.169> live<00:03:38.380> opponent<00:03:38.709> it'd<00:03:39.099> be<00:03:39.389> this

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
playing a live opponent it'd be this

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.120 
playing a live opponent it'd be this
would<00:03:40.569> be<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> lot<00:03:40.720> different<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
would be a lot different and it's a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400 
would be a lot different and it's a
little<00:03:42.220> bit<00:03:42.340> harder<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.810> pull<00:03:43.810> off<00:03:43.840> some<00:03:44.319> of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
little bit harder to pull off some of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.729 
little bit harder to pull off some of
these<00:03:44.530> moves

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.619 

but<00:03:49.739> yeah<00:03:49.980> really<00:03:50.310> it's<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:51.090> stick<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
but yeah really it's just this stick the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.390 
but yeah really it's just this stick the
buttons<00:03:51.959> are<00:03:52.109> fine<00:03:52.379> I<00:03:52.409> mean<00:03:52.829> I've<00:03:52.920> never<00:03:53.099> had

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
buttons are fine I mean I've never had

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.470 
buttons are fine I mean I've never had
any<00:03:53.730> problems<00:03:54.299> with<00:03:54.390> any<00:03:54.629> of<00:03:54.719> the<00:03:54.810> buttons<00:03:56.060> I

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:12.530 

think<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> any<00:04:00.629> complaints<00:04:10.909> not<00:04:11.909> too<00:04:12.180> many<00:04:12.359> i

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
think of any complaints not too many i

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.119 
think of any complaints not too many i
mean<00:04:12.930> i<00:04:12.959> guess<00:04:13.200> maybe<00:04:13.469> if<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.799> were<00:04:13.889> getting

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
mean i guess maybe if you were getting

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.930 
mean i guess maybe if you were getting
into<00:04:14.189> heavy<00:04:14.459> combos<00:04:16.100> might<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.340> able<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.579> like

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
into heavy combos might be able to like

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.670 
into heavy combos might be able to like
I'm<00:04:18.030> just<00:04:18.180> about<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.419> wail<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.350> see<00:04:19.590> if

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
I'm just about to wail on and see if

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:39.710 
I'm just about to wail on and see if
anything<00:04:20.070> weird<00:04:20.609> happen<00:04:38.060> see<00:04:39.060> that's<00:04:39.300> kind<00:04:39.630> of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
anything weird happen see that's kind of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.710 
anything weird happen see that's kind of
sometimes<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.919> think<00:04:41.880> that's<00:04:42.150> actually<00:04:42.389> my

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
sometimes I think that's actually my

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.390 
sometimes I think that's actually my
lack<00:04:43.110> skill<00:04:44.300> that's<00:04:45.300> causing<00:04:45.870> me<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:47.009> pull<00:04:47.220> off

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
lack skill that's causing me to pull off

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.960 
lack skill that's causing me to pull off
that<00:04:47.430> kid<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:52.130> before<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.159> cap<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.580> off<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.909> guess

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
that kid and before I cap it off I guess

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.029 
that kid and before I cap it off I guess
I'll<00:04:54.270> sometimes<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:55.380> have<00:04:55.470> trouble<00:04:55.590> trying<00:04:56.010> to

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.649 
mean even my big burly handsy on
breaking<00:05:13.770> down<00:05:13.949> anything<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.669> stopped<00:05:15.449> at<00:05:15.570> any

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
breaking down anything I stopped at any

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.320 
breaking down anything I stopped at any
problems<00:05:16.199> I've<00:05:16.380> had<00:05:16.409> it<00:05:16.710> for<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.370> few<00:05:17.430> months

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
problems I've had it for a few months

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.730 
problems I've had it for a few months
now<00:05:18.659> so<00:05:21.080> I'd<00:05:22.080> recommend<00:05:22.289> it<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:23.449> mean<00:05:24.449> but

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
now so I'd recommend it I mean but

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.890 
now so I'd recommend it I mean but
really<00:05:25.740> comes<00:05:25.949> down<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.419> think<00:05:27.419> it's<00:05:27.509> worth<00:05:27.720> it

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
really comes down to think it's worth it

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.570 
really comes down to think it's worth it
and<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.110> haven't<00:05:28.349> got<00:05:28.440> mine<00:05:28.620> for<00:05:28.830> sixty<00:05:29.159> dollars
