I<00:00:35.880> was<00:00:36.180> doing<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.600> research<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I was doing some research and as to a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.280 
I was doing some research and as to a
better<00:00:39.600> method<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.440> finding<00:00:40.710> term<00:00:41.100> ice<00:00:42.290> being

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
better method for finding term ice being

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.200 
better method for finding term ice being
behind<00:00:43.469> walls<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> stuff<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:44.940> be

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
behind walls and stuff they can be

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.139 
behind walls and stuff they can be
missed<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.100> come<00:00:47.100> across<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.820> fact<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
missed and come across the fact that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
missed and come across the fact that
dogs<00:00:48.780> could<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.399> research<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
dogs could do that and in research I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
dogs could do that and in research I
talked<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> three<00:00:51.600> dog<00:00:52.260> trainers<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> train

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
dogs and found out that the method that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500 
dogs and found out that the method that
was<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.949> most<00:00:56.309> precise<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> most<00:00:57.090> accurate

dogs have been has a new refined system

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
dogs have been has a new refined system
that<00:01:56.009> hasn't<00:01:56.310> been<00:01:56.399> around<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.719> than

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that hasn't been around for more than

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
that hasn't been around for more than
five<00:01:58.320> years<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.009> here's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> question<00:01:59.850> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
five years all right here's a question I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
five years all right here's a question I
mean<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.960> drugs<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.530> smell<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> mean<00:02:02.159> do

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
mean with drugs you can smell I mean do

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.709 
mean with drugs you can smell I mean do
they<00:02:02.399> smell<00:02:02.640> termites<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
they smell termites what is it that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.940 
they smell termites what is it that
attracts<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> dog<00:02:04.409> how<00:02:04.560> did<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.770> recognize

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
attracts the dog how did they recognize

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
attracts the dog how did they recognize
the<00:02:05.430> term<00:02:05.610> eyes<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.299> question

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the term eyes that's a good question

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
the term eyes that's a good question
it's<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.229> part<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> ongoing<00:02:07.829> study

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's actually part of the ongoing study

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's actually part of the ongoing study
that<00:02:08.550> we've<00:02:08.640> been<00:02:08.759> doing<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> past<00:02:09.179> five

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that we've been doing for the past five

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.470 
that we've been doing for the past five
years<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.440> been<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.090> theory<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> there's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
years there's been a theory that there's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
years there's been a theory that there's
that<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:13.020> they<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.140> detecting

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that what they are detecting

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that what they are detecting
the<00:02:13.950> methane<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:16.050> trails<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.280> that's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the methane or the trails and that's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.480 
the methane or the trails and that's
part<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> research<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.110> so

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
part of the research and it's so

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.440 
part of the research and it's so
significant<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.700> taken<00:02:21.030> over<00:02:21.090> five

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
significant that it's taken over five

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.030 
significant that it's taken over five
years<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.900> determine<00:02:22.020> exactly<00:02:22.710> what<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
years to determine exactly what the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.290 
years to determine exactly what the
compounds<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> termites<00:02:24.180> are

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
compounds that the termites are

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
compounds that the termites are
detecting<00:02:24.840> oh<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.830> cool<00:02:26.130> I've<00:02:26.310> never

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
detecting oh that is so cool I've never

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.830 
detecting oh that is so cool I've never
heard<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.480> really<00:02:27.630> interesting

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
heard of this this is really interesting

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.940 
heard of this this is really interesting
and<00:02:28.170> you're<00:02:28.320> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> give<00:02:28.680> us<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and you're going to give us a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.160 
and you're going to give us a
demonstration<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.660> we've<00:02:30.900> done<00:02:30.930> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
demonstration so what we've done is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.470 
demonstration so what we've done is
we've<00:02:31.440> pinned<00:02:32.100> some<00:02:32.310> termites<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.450> of

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
we've pinned some termites in one of

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.420 
we've pinned some termites in one of
these<00:02:33.660> bushes<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.530> don't<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:34.980> which<00:02:35.100> one<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
these bushes I don't know which one it

going to start at this building and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.610 
going to start at this building and
we're<00:02:51.600> going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> work<00:02:51.990> down<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.320> building

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
we're going to work down this building

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
we're going to work down this building
you'll<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.550> re<00:02:53.790> working<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.540> his<00:02:54.690> nose

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you'll see re working it with his nose

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.510 
you'll see re working it with his nose
down<00:02:55.170> here<00:02:55.470> when<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.280> he<00:02:56.400> will

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
down here when we get to it he will

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.300 
down here when we get to it he will
actually<00:02:56.940> Paul<00:02:57.270> where<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.740> termites<00:02:59.160> are

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
actually Paul where the termites are

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
actually Paul where the termites are
this<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.700> how<00:02:59.820> he<00:02:59.880> tells<00:03:00.240> me<00:03:00.480> where<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
this is how he tells me where the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.680 
this is how he tells me where the
termites<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> we'll<00:03:03.330> go<00:03:03.450> ahead<00:03:03.480> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
termites are and so we'll go ahead and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.790 
termites are and so we'll go ahead and
get<00:03:03.840> started<00:03:04.020> I'm<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.560> give<00:03:04.680> him

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
get started I'm going to give him

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.890 
get started I'm going to give him
command<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.490> get<00:03:05.670> over<00:03:05.820> here<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.690> find

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
command when we get over here to find

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:20.630 
command when we get over here to find
his<00:03:07.110> tease<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.590> he'll<00:03:07.740> start<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.040> work

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.240 

now<00:03:21.270> he's<00:03:21.900> looking<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.530> termites<00:03:22.980> right

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
now he's looking for the termites right

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.670 
now he's looking for the termites right
now<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:23.670> his<00:03:23.790> nose<00:03:24.230> essentially<00:03:25.230> he's<00:03:25.500> at

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
now with his nose essentially he's at

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.460 
now with his nose essentially he's at
he's<00:03:25.980> x-raying<00:03:26.490> this<00:03:26.760> wall<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:28.080> find<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
he's x-raying this wall here to find the
