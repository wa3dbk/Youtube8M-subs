parachute combo it is too good of a
combination<00:05:30.380> in<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.790> end<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.240> think<00:05:32.570> I<00:05:32.660> could

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
combination in the end I think I could

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.180 
combination in the end I think I could
say<00:05:32.990> that<00:05:33.020> these<00:05:33.290> two<00:05:33.530> weapons<00:05:33.919> are

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
say that these two weapons are

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.130 
say that these two weapons are
acceptable<00:05:35.120> they<00:05:35.690> both<00:05:35.870> have<00:05:36.110> their

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
acceptable they both have their

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.440 
acceptable they both have their
positives<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:36.979> negatives<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.970> combination

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
positives and negatives the combination

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.659 
positives and negatives the combination
of<00:05:38.539> both<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.110> slightly<00:05:39.770> overbearing<00:05:40.550> out

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
of both is a slightly overbearing out

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.580 
of both is a slightly overbearing out
the<00:05:40.789> enemy<00:05:41.090> team<00:05:41.270> but<00:05:41.780> I'm<00:05:41.900> sure<00:05:42.169> that<00:05:42.470> if

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
the enemy team but I'm sure that if

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.440 
the enemy team but I'm sure that if
enough<00:05:42.710> people<00:05:43.130> complained<00:05:43.520> valve<00:05:44.090> will<00:05:44.240> act

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
enough people complained valve will act

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.510 
enough people complained valve will act
upon<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:44.780> immediately<00:05:45.350> a<00:05:45.560> nerf<00:05:45.919> these<00:05:46.130> weapons

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
upon it immediately a nerf these weapons

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.340 
upon it immediately a nerf these weapons
so<00:05:46.789> much<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.570> they'll<00:05:47.720> be<00:05:47.870> completely

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
so much that they'll be completely

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.620 
so much that they'll be completely
ignored<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:49.010> about<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.280> week's<00:05:49.550> time<00:05:49.669> until

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
ignored in about a week's time until

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.120 
ignored in about a week's time until
