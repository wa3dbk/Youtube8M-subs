00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello today we will talk again about 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.620
 beauty hamedorea 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 or bamboo palm is amazing 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 plant 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.179
 one of my favorites that's why 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.820
 I want to dedicate another video to her 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.820
 hamedorea graceful most common 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 kind and most unpretentious 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 Today I am acquainted with a palm tree which 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.920
 growing with my mom and this plant 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.929
 is my mika reiki's parent 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 Looks more interesting because here 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 two palm trees 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.000
 and they are already big enough 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 special attention is not paid to the plant 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 growing by itself without any 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.039
 fertilizing and watering humidification 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.550
 her not as often as necessary and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.690
 occasionally arrange her a shower which by the way 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.539
 say she really loves 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.609
 transplant it every three to four years 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 I grew up on this almost all the time 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.580
 near the north window and only recently 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.220
 moved to western i'm all talking to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.689
 the fact that Hamedorea is really very 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.299
 unpretentious plant 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.200
 and this despite the fact that she comes from 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.020
 tropics 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 this unpretentious beauty actively 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.909
 used in the interior 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.030
 moreover, both apartments and offices are growing 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.180
 it is in almost any light 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.579
 except of course direct sunlight 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.030
 hamedorea can bloom anytime 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.650
 years, not every palm is capable of such 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.650
 at home 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 Hamedorei is better in winter 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.030
 just bring out to the veranda or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.119
 glazed balcony lowering her 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 temperatures up to 16 and 18 degrees and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.630
 thus provide peace until spring 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 besides hmi gifts and graceful exist and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.219
 other species 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.670
 for example Hamedorea is high however 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.530
 graceful with stairs most often lives 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 Next to us 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 Hamedorea not only pleases the eye but also 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.690
 fills the atmosphere of positive energy 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
 This is one of the best moisturizing plants. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 air and eliminate 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.060
 whose harmful impurities and on 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.490
 today is all 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.490
 Hamedorea all bye
