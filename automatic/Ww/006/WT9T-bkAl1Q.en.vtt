00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
we got it going on inside okay we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.370 
we got it going on inside okay we're
trying<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.899> make<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.970> fit<00:01:07.970> perfect<00:01:08.660> plus

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
trying to make this fit perfect plus

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.580 
trying to make this fit perfect plus
right<00:01:09.710> here<00:01:10.450> see<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.580> we<00:01:13.789> took<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.119> door<00:01:14.300> off

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
right here see so we took the door off

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.840 
right here see so we took the door off
stored<00:01:15.590> those<00:01:15.770> right<00:01:15.979> here<00:01:16.160> it<00:01:16.310> opens<00:01:16.610> up<00:01:16.700> like

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
stored those right here it opens up like

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.330 
stored those right here it opens up like
this<00:01:17.119> you're<00:01:18.080> gonna<00:01:18.170> cut<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.649> right<00:01:19.039> around

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
this you're gonna cut it right around

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.290 
this you're gonna cut it right around
here<00:01:19.700> make<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.720> fit<00:01:20.990> like<00:01:21.289> that<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.149> had

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
here make that fit like that so we had

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.859 
here make that fit like that so we had
to<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:24.069> you<00:01:25.069> got<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:25.280> cut<00:01:25.459> this<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:26.569> here

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
to do you got to cut this right here

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.229 
to do you got to cut this right here
here<00:01:28.209> bend<00:01:29.209> it<00:01:29.390> back<00:01:29.630> let<00:01:30.319> me<00:01:30.349> drill<00:01:30.649> holes<00:01:30.920> in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:31.239 
here bend it back let me drill holes in

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.830 
here bend it back let me drill holes in
holes<00:01:32.239> match<00:01:32.599> up<00:01:32.920> with<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.069> holes<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:34.429> here

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
holes match up with the holes on here

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.660 
holes match up with the holes on here
we're<00:01:35.840> gonna<00:01:35.959> drill<00:01:36.319> two<00:01:36.590> more<00:01:37.069> holes<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
we're gonna drill two more holes and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.190 
we're gonna drill two more holes and
down<00:01:38.000> below<00:01:38.739> so<00:01:39.739> that<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.810> connects<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.959> like

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
down below so that this connects on like

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.910 
down below so that this connects on like
that<00:01:42.410> flush<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.789> we'll<00:01:43.910> have<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.149> door<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.890> it

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
that flush and we'll have the door so it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.670 
that flush and we'll have the door so it
looks<00:01:46.160> like<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:48.310> something<00:01:49.310> like<00:01:49.399> that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
looks like this something like that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:04.969 
looks like this something like that

too<00:02:05.979> many<00:02:07.020> yeah<00:02:08.020> that's<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.470> one<00:02:08.789> multiple

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
too many yeah that's the one multiple

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:23.430 
too many yeah that's the one multiple
lengths<00:02:10.149> we<00:02:10.270> need<00:02:12.990> my<00:02:13.990> physic<00:02:14.290> top<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.319> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
lengths we need my physic top so this is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.760 
lengths we need my physic top so this is
the<00:02:23.590> finished<00:02:24.010> product<00:02:25.140> Sirius<00:02:26.140> satellite

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
the finished product Sirius satellite

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.150 
the finished product Sirius satellite
radio<00:02:27.300> mounted<00:02:28.300> straight<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.720> through<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
radio mounted straight on through the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.040 
radio mounted straight on through the
drag<00:02:30.160> imagine<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:30.970> could<00:02:31.120> use<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.780> it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
drag imagine we could use this that it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.229 
drag imagine we could use this that it
would<00:02:32.170> cover<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:32.739> now<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.190> gotta<00:02:33.459> put<00:02:34.060> that

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
would cover it up now we gotta put that

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.830 
would cover it up now we gotta put that
on<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.269> let's<00:02:38.260> see<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> back

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
on there do that let's see the back

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:53.009 
on there do that let's see the back
there's<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> screws<00:02:49.860> stocks<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:52.480> real<00:02:52.780> quick

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
there's the screws stocks in real quick

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.390 
there's the screws stocks in real quick
I<00:02:53.230> drew<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.590> hole<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:53.980> side<00:02:54.130> right

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I drew on the hole on that side right

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.050 
I drew on the hole on that side right
there

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
there

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.890

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
this comes out this is gonna run plug

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.809 
this comes out this is gonna run plug
into<00:03:01.380> its<00:03:02.380> artillery<00:03:02.980> can<00:03:03.400> put<00:03:03.580> on<00:03:03.670> this

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
into its artillery can put on this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.650 
into its artillery can put on this
stereo<00:03:04.360> stereo<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:06.550> show<00:03:06.760> here<00:03:06.970> there

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.229 

throw<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> hole<00:03:10.959> back<00:03:11.140> here<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.850> run<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
throw the hole back here to to run the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.870 
throw the hole back here to to run the
power

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.000
