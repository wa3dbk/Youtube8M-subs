00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.859
 to make a challenge with you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 the brand challenged me to do 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.420
 Californian or move in my hair to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 easy and that everything you will need 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:35.219
 here inside this box then kit 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 already starts the super cool because it has a 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.930
 container for you to mix the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.879
 decolorizing powder and hydrogen peroxide without 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.590
 that a lot of families 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.200
 has to wash and then it also comes with 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 this fantasy is a mixer and here 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.309
 this part also serves to divide you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 your hair and with a brush that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.100
 suits you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 hair in the case of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.510
 and for you to apply the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 product also goes with the diffuser 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 against hydrogen peroxide is 30 volumes 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.790
 it also comes with the use 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.680
 cool 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 and here are instructions for you to do 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.299
 different types of light does not affect your 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.930
 I already have a consultancy here in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.729
 cake 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.740
 and another thing that I really liked about this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.080
 kit is that the gloves are not those 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 Bad clothes are the silicone clothes 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.860
 very cool that I will not get caught 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
 in your hair and that will fit 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.170
 perfectly in your hands 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.979
 My favorite things 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.780
 pitt is the treatment mask in four 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.759
 treatment mask weeks here 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.649
 that you will use the first week to 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.060
 second week to third week and fourth week 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.780
 So now that we have already 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.549
 You know what we 're all going to do. 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.530
 Well, to begin with, I'm going to separate the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.720
 my hair I like to separate it here 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.299
 back more or less in the middle play half 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.789
 for each side and here I am going to separate 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.310
 half of top also and bottom of thais 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.229
 and I'll let you work here on these 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.220
 half down I will do the same thing 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.220
 on the other side 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.539
 Now that part of the bottom that stayed here 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.460
 It's where we'll start working. 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.399
 Then screw your hair, let's mix the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.220
 product I'll take that efficient 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.140
 bleach and the evolving water will 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.459
 get my spatula and I'll put the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.459
 my silicone gloves 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.800
 and now I'm going to get hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.380
 It is important that you use all content 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 can decolorize and the entire contents of the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 hydrogen peroxide because it is already in 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 certain 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.880
 You have to mix until the dough 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.410
 be homogeneous and then when the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.990
 content was homogeneous first 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.250
 people will do with the top test and a 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.200
 second test you will need 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.150
 do is the wick test 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.880
 The important thing is to know that you can only 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.950
 leave the product in the hair up to 50 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.630
 minutes can not pass more than can start 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.810
 with a board underneath any side 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.410
 and we'll get the choice that comes in the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.900
 product here and here we go 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.269
 your hair is important that you 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.670
 Say your hair is done by doing it here. 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.739
 that occur integrated in your hair to 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.510
 that there is not that thing that you are 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.459
 here down the blonde from up here 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.140
 it breaks to get that effect as 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.890
 if you had to choose your hair 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 at the beach, right? 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.610
 I now everything in the last scrambled 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.490
 People are crazy to know how it goes. 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.020
 I'll stay here and finish ahead 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.850
 I'm going to leave about 30 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.710
 little minutes in my hair for him to open 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.720
 everything and look pretty good and there we 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.470
 Come back and see how the result will be. 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.470
 Last 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.450
 Now you're ready for the party, right? 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 And then look and see I took lots of products. 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.240
 wires spent hydrating mask 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.420
 wonderful that left my hair very 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.280
 soft and well hydrated skin and agents and 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.049
 Hair I'm here to show you 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.390
 the result of how it got 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.520
 the Californians and look how we say 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.110
 I'd rather have hair and make a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.760
 product from the bottom up 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.340
 you can see that the result was 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.560
 very subtle a gradient well done much more 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.810
 clear on the tips and then he will choose 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.790
 being root and then I want to make a 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.740
 special invitation for you guys 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.660
