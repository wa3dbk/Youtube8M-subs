00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
just one example of algae control I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
just one example of algae control I
can't<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.489> video<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.090> talk

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
real important things for algae control

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
real important things for algae control
guys<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.470> plants<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
guys is think about what plants are

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
guys is think about what plants are
gonna<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.450> instance

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
let's say you're running 2 or 3 watts

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
let's say you're running 2 or 3 watts
per<00:01:26.640> gallon<00:01:27.090> ok<00:01:27.479> let's<00:01:28.020> say<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:28.350> running

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
per gallon ok let's say you're running

per gallon ok let's say you're running
some<00:01:28.770> co2<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:29.970> least<00:01:30.150> dose<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
some co2 or you're at least dose and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.469 
some co2 or you're at least dose and
liquid<00:01:30.990> co2<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.040> let's<00:01:32.610> say<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.150> have

liquid co2 and let's say that you have

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.950 
liquid co2 and let's say that you have
you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.829> 2<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.549> 3<00:01:35.909> day<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> week<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.810> know

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you know a 2 or 3 day a week you know

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.719 
you know a 2 or 3 day a week you know
for<00:01:37.409> dosing<00:01:38.009> regimen<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:38.850> kind<00:01:39.119> alright

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
for dosing regimen of some kind alright

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
for dosing regimen of some kind alright
what's<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.880> happen<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> have

what's gonna happen is if you have

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
what's gonna happen is if you have
slower<00:01:43.170> growing<00:01:43.560> plants<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.280> Crips

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
slower growing plants like Crips

have in your tank you're probably gonna

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
have in your tank you're probably gonna
get<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> bunch<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.030> weird<00:01:51.270> hair<00:01:51.479> allergies<00:01:51.990> on

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
get a bunch of weird hair allergies on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.679 
get a bunch of weird hair allergies on
your<00:01:52.350> leaves<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.909> those<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.360> slow

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
your leaves because those are slow

plants<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.439> suck<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> lot

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
plants they don't you know suck up a lot

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.120 
plants they don't you know suck up a lot
of<00:01:59.399> nutrients<00:02:00.060> fast<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> thrive<00:02:01.130> they're

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
of nutrients fast to thrive they're

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
of nutrients fast to thrive they're
gonna<00:02:02.250> thrive<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> fine<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.570> low

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
gonna thrive just fine with low

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
gonna thrive just fine with low
nutrients<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.219> they're<00:02:05.820> just

they're<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.479> low<00:02:06.840> demand<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.829> they're<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
they're just low demand so they're just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
they're just low demand so they're just
gonna<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.789> chill<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.060> they're<00:02:09.599> gonna

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
gonna kind of chill and they're gonna

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.270 
gonna kind of chill and they're gonna
grow<00:02:09.989> no<00:02:10.200> matter<00:02:10.349> what<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.099> this

it<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.120> grew<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.680> point<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.159> had

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it just grew because at one point I had

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.890 
it just grew because at one point I had
Crips<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.909> here<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.360> ripped<00:02:18.629> them<00:02:18.750> out

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
Crips from here and I ripped them out

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.860 
and there was still a piece in there and
it<00:02:20.549> grew<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.310> low<00:02:23.310> maintenance<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.030> if

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it grew it's very low maintenance so if

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
it grew it's very low maintenance so if
you're<00:02:25.019> running<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.440> lot<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.799> Crips<00:02:26.099> or<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> lot
