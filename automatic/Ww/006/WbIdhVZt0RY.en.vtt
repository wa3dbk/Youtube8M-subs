00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.900
 and today again with a monster 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.969
 high doll it is already a bit 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 older not a whole new model 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.449
 namely from the dvd of 2014 and it 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.210
 This is again the budget 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 fusion and we have the school year here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 even if I pronounce it correctly 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 if I correct myself again 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.670
 I'm always very open to that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 you know and yes the whole thing is from one 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.450
 age of six plus and what is there 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.719
 still to say so you the packaging of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.260
 the whole thing comes from behind 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260
 mattel 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 and what is still here of the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.039
 fusions fashion trend has me 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.039
 Inspires me like dracula dracula 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 to attract 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 the monster girlfriend travel in time 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.239
 in time and merge with each other 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 with the help of the hybrids of 19 at the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.470
 Learn how to teach your school 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 common murders of moderate brands 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.360
 control and their biggest 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 can master the challenge and that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.869
 I believe on every packaging 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 on it and as I said, I found it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.729
 cabbage I like it so much with these colorful ones 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.430
 hair and with this blue and then so 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.960
 slightly blurred this technique i like 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 that's how I would say we pack that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:36.829
 Now let's have a look 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.829
 look closer and look at how cool 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.040
 and the beautiful as always the stalls 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.560
 where you put her so nice 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.450
 can and yes I do it all now 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.710
 and then we'll have a look 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.550
 a little closer and look how 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 she looks great 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.860
 I have to putt here now 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.150
 I'll do it a little bit 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.070
 that's just not a bit up 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.780
 same height 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 but by the whole moored at the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.840
 Sometimes it is not like that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.910
 easy to replace the whole 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.590
 and here you have the car now 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.890
 eyes on here you have the possibility 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.940
 also to take these teeth out with it 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.010
 she looks reasonably normal where is 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.540
 the great i like this hair is this one 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 Gradually so be with her 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.409
 then look here for a hairband 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:49.159
 a little bit like the bat 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.129
 made and look here below 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.329
 the dress on 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.720
 also really great here I still have the 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.799
 hand tight and here you look 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.030
 the great thing about the chic dress 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.819
 made really great little red 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.829
 grind the saddle moderately here 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.049
 Of course you can take it off in the back 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.200
 and then perhaps with another 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.090
 dress somehow yes then replace or 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.750
 maybe from other monster high 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.639
 doll wear the outfit and here 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.389
 below you can see that cool too 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.769
 Shoes 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:30.310
 looks awesome or so I love 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:34.040
 these monster high dolls and yes so 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.829
 that's the doll in itself and as I said 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.150
 it is the giulia even if I am here 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.920
 to pronounce it correctly we have here 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.859
 I can do that with the brush 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:51.400
 Afterwards, you can change your clothes 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:51.400
 we have an umbrella 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.459
 does not undo is also cool and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.330
 we have a pair of glasses here 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.300
 for she sees a look they do 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.319
 look the other way looks great or 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:16.090
 cool that way and of course we have the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.750
 stand for the doll partly so to 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.760
 put down 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.320
 there when you collect them and I find 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.040
 Ingenious about the said I can always only 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.400
 say again 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.050
 it would have to be something for the barbies 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.850
 is just so that they are not lying around 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.210
 that you can stand so nicely 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.880
 So that was our monster high 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.740
 doll and yes I have another one right away 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.690

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.820

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.980

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.450

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.610
