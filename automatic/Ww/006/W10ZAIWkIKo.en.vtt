00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
what's up guys what's going on we're

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.110 
what's up guys what's going on we're
checking<00:00:02.790> out<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.210> annihilation<00:00:04.020> Spectre

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
checking out the annihilation Spectre

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.270 
checking out the annihilation Spectre
like<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.270> said<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.600> my<00:00:06.629> car<00:00:06.960> expect<00:00:07.410> video<00:00:07.710> this

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
like I said in my car expect video this

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.080 
like I said in my car expect video this
spec<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.059> lot<00:00:09.300> easier<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.929> play<00:00:10.790> but<00:00:11.790> I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
spec is a lot easier to play but I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
spec is a lot easier to play but I
highly<00:00:12.840> suggest<00:00:13.139> if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.980> pull<00:00:14.250> off

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
highly suggest if you can pull off

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.400 
highly suggest if you can pull off
carnage<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.210> definitely<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.199> will

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
carnage then definitely do that you will

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.970 
carnage then definitely do that you will
see<00:00:16.820> better<00:00:17.820> numbers<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
see better numbers with that but if you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
see better numbers with that but if you
can't<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.430> headed<00:00:20.699> with<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> milli<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.300> shin<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
can't get headed with a milli a shin and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.150 
can't get headed with a milli a shin and
it's<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> lot<00:00:22.350> easier<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.800> play<00:00:23.600> let's<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.750> into

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's a lot easier to play let's get into

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's a lot easier to play let's get into
gearing<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:27.170> for<00:00:28.170> accuracy<00:00:29.160> you're<00:00:29.369> going

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
gearing here for accuracy you're going

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.980 
gearing here for accuracy you're going
to<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.880> hundred<00:00:30.210> percent<00:00:30.300> mailee

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to want a hundred percent mailee

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
to want a hundred percent mailee
accuracy<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.189> guy<00:00:32.520> optimized

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
accuracy I don't have my guy optimized

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
accuracy I don't have my guy optimized
around<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.620> more<00:00:34.920> optimized

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
around it because I have more optimized
