it's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.830> popular<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.340> season

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's a really really popular this season

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.070 
it's a really really popular this season
they're<00:01:50.759> quite<00:01:50.940> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.299> tease<00:01:51.539> i<00:01:51.840> think

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
they're quite kind of a tease i think

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.240 
they're quite kind of a tease i think
and<00:01:52.440> i<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.709> it's<00:01:52.830> something<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.039> this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and i think it's something like this

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.650 
and i think it's something like this
over<00:01:53.580> something<00:01:53.819> printed<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.629> a

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
over something printed would be like a

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.719 
over something printed would be like a
really<00:01:54.929> good<00:01:55.140> look<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:55.709> it's<00:01:55.890> less<00:01:56.069> hot<00:01:56.250> sexy

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
really good look so it's less hot sexy

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.580 
really good look so it's less hot sexy
and<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.629> think<00:01:57.929> this<00:01:58.140> would<00:01:58.319> be<00:01:58.349> a<00:01:58.470> good

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and i think this would be a good

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.609 
and i think this would be a good
cover<00:01:58.830> up<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.250> barbecue
