00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.580
 ah 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.430
 ah 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.929
 Hi, what are we going to do today? 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.300
 It is a tree to decorate in our house 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.550
 The essential materials are wire 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.680
 three types 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.189
 of pliers for pressing and for 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.989
 cut and what I have taken apart are 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.960
 some old earrings that I had for 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.000
 there for house that I was not going to put them 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 they had these little balls on 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.960
 we started 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.220
 I have cut the wires 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.910
 to a measure 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.920
 it's about 50 centimeters or so 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.950
 then we take an end that is in 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.310
 all wires at the same height more 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.680
 or less 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.640
 and with one of them 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640
 we roll it 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.800
 so they do not move the rest of 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.200
 wires 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.530
 the little tip so that it does not hurt us in 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.159
 the fingers 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 I take one of these pliers and what 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.150
 tight and a little bit 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.680
 you do not hurt yourself 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 the next 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.520
 is to separate 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.550
 The wires 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.100
 a little bit 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.690
 of two in two of three in three according to how 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.980
 you want 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.000
 first it separates them all so that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 remain square 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.350
 and this is how it is all about twisting 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.840
 you want if you hurt yourself or if you 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.870
 slip in your hands with the same 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 pliers 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.910
 You are twisting the twisting 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.970
 well until the end of each of the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.659
 supposes that they are going to be the roots of 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 little tree 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.300
 well once finished everything what are the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.900
 branches of 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.900
 of the roots 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.040
 we look to see if there are any 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.000
 It can hurt us and we cut it but 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.460
 now let's make the trunk 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.010
 and this bothers us, we fold it like this 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.390
 a little 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.390
 so that it does not bother us 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.110
 we take a plier to hold what 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300
 we put here in the part from where 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.300
 the roots begin 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.810
 and then we take the other 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.840
 pliers 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.110
 and we started to twist everything that is the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 trunk 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.550
 it does not matter if it is not straight 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.900
 straight seems less real 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.900
 but so twisted 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.400
 it is as well as more rustic 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.890
 I liked it better but then you can 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.090
 twist if you do everything straight then 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.090
 You can twist as you want
