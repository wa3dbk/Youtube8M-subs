00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
now that you don't have to switch back

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.880 
now that you don't have to switch back
and<00:02:29.760> forth<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.269> before<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.989> had<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.620> turn

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and forth because before you had to turn

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.220 
and forth because before you had to turn
something<00:02:32.160> off<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:32.849> if<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.900> had<00:02:34.050> like

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
something off and then if it had like

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
something off and then if it had like
something<00:02:34.620> further<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.069> could<00:02:35.250> adjust<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
something further you could adjust you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.449 
something further you could adjust you
had<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.300> turn<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.690> off<00:02:37.099> adjust<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
had to know turn it off adjust it and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.370 
had to know turn it off adjust it and
turn<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.269> back<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:39.660> now<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.200> just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
turn it back on but now you can just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
turn it back on but now you can just
leave<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.310> kind<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.640> switch<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
leave it on and kind of switch it on the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.420 
leave it on and kind of switch it on the
fly<00:02:42.390> which<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.780> pretty<00:02:42.900> nice<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.069> that's<00:02:44.190> kind

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
fly which is pretty nice so that's kind

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.699 
fly which is pretty nice so that's kind
of<00:02:44.459> just<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.730> nice<00:02:44.940> kind<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.569> design<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.230> ease

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
of just a nice kind of design and ease

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.259 
of just a nice kind of design and ease
of<00:02:46.739> use<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:49.549> really<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.819> update<00:02:51.120> but
