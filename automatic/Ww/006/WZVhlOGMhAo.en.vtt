 and for convenience and for ease of removal 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.760
 tires from the wheel 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.490
 there should not be every set 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.920
 They look like this 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 smooth here this side 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.990

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.709
 court 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.709
 tires on both facilitate yourself 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 work let him withdraw 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.890
 tires 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.660
 when the camera is removed from the tire 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.790
 tire 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.980
 need to check inside and after 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.640
 of how 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.260
 checked the inner tire layer is not 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.210
 found no foreign objects 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 Stones and glass wire pour in 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.600
 take out a spare camera 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:05.280
 straightened the camera slightly pumped up 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:11.010
 and insert start leaving nipple 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.580
 may further refill the camera itself 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580
 tire 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.440
 if there is a retaining ring fitted 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.440
 snap ring to avoid 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.829
 but not such a measure in the refueling process 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.829
 tires 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 everyone put the camera refueled 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.700
