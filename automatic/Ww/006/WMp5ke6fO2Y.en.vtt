I<00:05:02.070> talk<00:05:02.130> about<00:05:02.460> this<00:05:02.610> game<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:04.050> know<00:05:04.140> I

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
I talk about this game you know I

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.350 
I talk about this game you know I
haven't<00:05:04.410> really<00:05:04.620> talked<00:05:04.860> about<00:05:04.950> maps<00:05:05.430> lately

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
haven't really talked about maps lately

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.030 
haven't really talked about maps lately
I<00:05:06.660> like<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.290> maps<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.710> game<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:08.010> the

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
I like the maps in this game for the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.909 
I like the maps in this game for the
most<00:05:08.190> part<00:05:08.430> except<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:09.200> Hanoi<00:05:10.700> array<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:13.250> i

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
most part except for Hanoi array and i

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.380 
most part except for Hanoi array and i
think<00:05:16.919> that's<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.580> really<00:05:18.150> don't<00:05:18.330> like

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
think that's it I really don't like

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.330 
think that's it I really don't like
those<00:05:18.660> two<00:05:18.870> any<00:05:19.410> time<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.770> other<00:05:19.890> thing<00:05:20.220> I

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
those two any time the other thing I

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.990 
those two any time the other thing I
just<00:05:20.550> automatically<00:05:21.150> either<00:05:21.660> back<00:05:22.080> out<00:05:22.320> or

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
just automatically either back out or

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.320 
just automatically either back out or
just<00:05:24.000> choose<00:05:24.900> random<00:05:25.680> because<00:05:26.580> honestly<00:05:27.240> I

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
just choose random because honestly I

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.800 
just choose random because honestly I
hate<00:05:27.600> those<00:05:27.750> maps<00:05:28.400> but<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:30.120> know<00:05:30.210> gotta<00:05:30.510> play

them so um on the topic of maps let me
just<00:05:35.970> talk<00:05:36.090> about<00:05:36.450> an<00:05:36.720> opening<00:05:37.590> route<00:05:37.830> for

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
just talk about an opening route for

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.710 
just talk about an opening route for
this<00:05:39.110> um<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.169> think<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.860> last<00:05:41.510> when<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.540> was

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
this um I think in the last when I was

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.140 
this um I think in the last when I was
on<00:05:42.860> defense<00:05:43.860> right<00:05:44.190> yeah<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.669> last<00:05:44.880> like

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
on defense right yeah the last like

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.530 
on defense right yeah the last like
three<00:05:45.180> rounds<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.729> ran<00:05:47.729> underground<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.510> I

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
three rounds I ran underground and I

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.980 
three rounds I ran underground and I
think<00:05:48.690> I'm<00:05:48.780> running<00:05:48.840> on<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.050> groundout<00:05:49.320> now<00:05:49.470> so

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
think I'm running on a groundout now so

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.500 
think I'm running on a groundout now so
yeah<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:50.830> think<00:05:51.700> my<00:05:51.760> favorite<00:05:51.970> opening<00:05:52.330> round

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
yeah I think my favorite opening round

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.110 
yeah I think my favorite opening round
for<00:05:52.660> this<00:05:53.010> map<00:05:54.010> is<00:05:54.340> definitely<00:05:54.970> going

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
for this map is definitely going

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.550 
for this map is definitely going
underground<00:05:55.510> it's<00:05:56.470> about<00:05:56.620> it's<00:05:57.130> definitely

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
underground it's about it's definitely

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.990 
underground it's about it's definitely
safer<00:05:59.560> and<00:05:59.860> I<00:06:00.130> think<00:06:00.370> going<00:06:00.580> on<00:06:00.670> top<00:06:00.850> because

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
safer and I think going on top because

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.300 
safer and I think going on top because
people<00:06:01.390> like<00:06:01.690> their<00:06:01.990> spawn<00:06:02.830> tomahawks

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
people like their spawn tomahawks

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.710 
people like their spawn tomahawks
montage<00:06:04.410> Grizz<00:06:05.880> ballistic<00:06:06.880> knife<00:06:07.030> cross<00:06:07.420> maps

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
montage Grizz ballistic knife cross maps

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.660 
montage Grizz ballistic knife cross maps
you<00:06:08.110> know<00:06:08.230> and<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:08.950> I<00:06:08.980> think<00:06:09.130> that<00:06:09.370> going

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
you know and so I think that going

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.500 
you know and so I think that going
underground<00:06:09.880> is<00:06:10.120> definitely<00:06:10.390> a<00:06:10.420> better

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
underground is definitely a better

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.510 
underground is definitely a better
choice<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.870> if<00:06:14.530> you<00:06:14.620> have<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.860> team<00:06:15.160> just

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
choice and if you have a team just

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.090 
choice and if you have a team just
communicate<00:06:16.060> tell<00:06:16.270> them<00:06:16.420> where<00:06:16.510> you're<00:06:16.600> going
