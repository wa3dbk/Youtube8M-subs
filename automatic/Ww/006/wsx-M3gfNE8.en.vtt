00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.920
 good that puts make a rain of 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.980
 arrows that I have also got 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.250
 good to create a rain of items then 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.040
 is trying to create a rain of 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.390
 experience but I could not because I've 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.949
 been trying in the truth is that 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.060
 I have not been able so well we're going to 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.120
 stay with these two 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.650
 and well we go there as you can see here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.040
 decorating from time to time I get bored and 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.500
 of with a little bit we are going to put the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.900
 rain is good, this is one thing 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 It gives a lot of 'q' but it's pretty 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.510
 fun you'll see that he put this on 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.010
 I do not know why I've put it here 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 let's go is pauner we have to wait for a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.550
 little because the good law is slow 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 his puts them in to warm up 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 this needs now is that you need a 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.080
 spa a range you see this would be a rain 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.210
 of pretty arrows then why to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 because you have me for a ranch of 10 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.090
 to the stream I am 10 blocks apart for 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.430
 which I do if it comes back again is worth 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.920
 let's see let's see something first of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.290
 you can see that I can take them but if I already 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.020
 I put a zero memo 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 You can not pick me stay that way 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 I put one of them because I pick them all 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.409
 because this is these dates are the same 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.179
 that those of 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.799
 that the good ones are going to do one thing 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.799
 before we are going to change it this he 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.050
 found by the player range and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.860
 let's put 100 so good to see 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 because I can pick them up 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 only in creative it is worth if we put pickup 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.520
 ok this means we can 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.830
 pick up if we put one we can 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.990
 pick up on in your rival also already worth and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 if we put them and put pick up 2 only 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.790
 we can collect them in creative 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 let's break spanair and I'm going to put 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.960
 in your rival and you see face as the change 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.790
 I do not pick up the pickup 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.500
 I do not know what happened to see 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.500
 pick up you're better before 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.330
 I'm going to try putting pickup 0 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.330
 just in case my snack 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.210
 It's worth it already puts them enough 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 let's try now the best thing is that I 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.640
 I'm playing with this but I 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.610
 Well, if I 'm wrong, it's worth nothing 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.500
 we are here again 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.480
 and I had a little problem already 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.990
 we are here again change one thing 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.990
 that good 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 he did not let me pick up the arrows anymore 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.410
 I have removed good we continue with the command 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.720
 let's put this well pick up 2 other 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.200
 time because good 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.330
 OK 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.310
 let's now put them in creative in their 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.790
 rival to see how much damage they do to us 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 these arrows 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.150
 ok you see that they have killed us all at once 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.250
 good this because it is because an arrow 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.590
 has 40 damage then we can 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.370
 Remove the damage and make it good 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.370
 let's see where we are 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.500
 and it is not giving a the one that this already 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.230
 you have done in several videos that 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.880
 let me go loft and find good I want 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.310
 but more time is worth it has already 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.440
 lowered all the resolution and all game 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.260
 the air 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.330
 No wonder it shut with all this 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.390
 let's do it again but this time 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.900
 what we are going to do is to put the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.830
 damage 1 to see we are going to hurt him 1 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.720
 Okay we do like this and it rains again 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.090
 arrows then we get here in the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.670
 medium and you see that the arrow removes us 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.260
 Take half a heart if we put two 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.780
 it would take away a whole heart 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.970
 good and so making clear 40 takes away 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.590
 for life a bending one one 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.000
 date takes away all our lives worth this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.260
 is giving me a lot that I have 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.290
 said that this is for computers 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.000
 powerful and mine is not anything less 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.690
 so then I'm going to explain to you the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.210
 command now it's worth to expose as 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.980
 you have already seen then we are going to come 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.050
 here the thousand coordinates are blocked 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.970
 Cape Ves Pauner and then you start 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.250
 here with the marmoset and of vale what we're going 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.630
 to do let's spanair arrows arrows 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.090
 with the range the good if the radius of 5 or 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.340
 be five blocks around exposes to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.610
 CIA whenever is given by 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.889
 spur on a judith and have that is 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.169
 plan whenever there is a player like that 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.909
 distance from spanair and good law 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.249
 I'm in the workshop and I explained everything 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.840
 in the tutorial of modifying spoilers like this 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.430
 that if you want to go by then this 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.949
 it's basically the speed of spawning myself 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.930
 between Spaniards pau is not worth the extremes 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.300
 spam data that here we can put several 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.969
 things like ladies since it would be the damage 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.889
 that makes pick up that this is for good 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.779
 I've said it before and motion that is 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.669
 for what would be the address and everything 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.129
 this is ok let's see now the other one is 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.200
 pauner to see all this that he does here 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:31.670
 ok I can not pick it up 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.670
 ok let's put it 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.960
 I in diamonds is cool 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.160
 man I like when when have you 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.770
 finished map the truth that is 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 pretty good to do this as for 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.100
 make a party not like it's already 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.889
 finished then come here to rain 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.050
 diamonds I will explain the command 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.389
 it's very simple it's also the same 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.850
 that I have changed instead of exposing a 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.880
 road the put an item is valid and we go back 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.500
 here and here we put what would be the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.610
 elite information in the spawn data is 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.380
 puts all the information then 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.190
 we will see item and 264 with 10 or 10 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.260
 diamonds that would be the air 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.790
 for the boys I did not have much that 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.850
 explain them in this tutorial basically 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.260
 was to explain the spoilers but good to 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.670
 I think it 's a pretty tutorial 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.830
 interesting the truth and I thought 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.540
 very interesting for adventure maps 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.340
 can you really serve the truth is if 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.270
 you know how to use them, maybe you can 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.480
 look very good so good if you have 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.160
 Any question you tell me if you have 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.320
 some video suggestion also what 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.370
 You can already say what you know 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.470
 sanjuaneros commands in the description 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.230
 as always and if good if someone knew 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.580
 do it from the experience by 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.610
 please tell me why I'm staying 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.080
 there with the intrigue of how this was done 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.790
 It's worth it because I wanted to make you three minimum 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.990
 so that the video would be better 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.600
 but good in the end I could not so 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.830
 or it has all been done, well, good guys and 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.160
 this is all I hope you like the 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.160
 video and nothing until another goodbye
