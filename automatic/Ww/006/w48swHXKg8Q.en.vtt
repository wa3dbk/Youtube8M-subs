00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.380
 to do all the music 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.039
 we are going to add a little salt 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.460
 of water just do not know exactly what 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 amount carries I always look situ to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.489
 So then because here I have what 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.420
 it's three cups the water has to be 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.920
 put a little warm but not much and the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.629
 let's add it does not have to go very well 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.850
 that's because I do not think it's that hard 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.430
 because it is almost the same is to make a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.710
 mix as well as prepare the dough for 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 the tortillas another more than if you have to 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.320
 stay a little more be soft no 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.960
 It has to stay when it's dry because 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.129
 is this flour is a little bit more 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.490
 is more ground then this one gives you more 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.250
 well a texture like cornstarch and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.000
 this then you have to leave a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.000
 little bit 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.800
 well 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 and in the end I ended up throwing him three cups 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:29.380
 and a half for that package of flour 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.380
 rice that has contains 24 ounces 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.140
 three and a half cups of water 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.390
 but adding that with little and we go to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.630
 get together if this is the consistency that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 it has to be 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 it just feels a little 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.950
 sticky but it's the same thing that makes 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.850
 this different the flour that is to money 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.850
 then how do we have the most 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.210
 we already have the ingredients for 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.640
 begin to make our pupusas are 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.030
 the beans 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.590
 the cheese with the crazy 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.739
 and the cooked pork rind 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 and here we have the dough made of flour 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.820
 of rice 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.100
 I recommend you have another 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.350
 container with water and another with oil 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.030
 Well, each one of us, I understand that 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.810
 many people have different ways of 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.270
 to do it and then this me is like me 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.010
 I prepare them in the water I have it here 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.750
 to rinse their hands after they 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.170
 I just did each one so that I do not 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.240
 the hand is full of the dough and the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.680
 oil I use it so that I do not get 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.750
 Stick the dough in your hands when I'm 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.930
 doing the pupusas and that's from a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.150
 great help another little tip that 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.740
 I learned from a lady that when I 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.230
 I was already teaching the juicy ones 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.810
 time she told me look for you 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.510
 come out better the pupusas this the secret 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.220
 of that and that a lot of people use is 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.200
 that all the ingredients have to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.930
 be at the same temperature so that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.880
 the time that you do the compulsa this one is 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.820
 well integrate all the ingredients and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 do not be bad, do not be bad and do not miss 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.819
 do not break 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.280
 so I hope it serves you this 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.430
 advice also we are not really going to talk 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.140
 of the hand with little oil to be able 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.640
 fix the ball of the dough 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.060
 to start start doing what 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.060
 press 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.930
 let's make a little ball we're going to 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.930
 do in the form of a single mecca 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.910
 A) Yes 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.910
 and we're going to start this thickening 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 yes 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.250
 and then we're going to throw him to the ground 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.579
 work without fear because I at 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.439
 principle had the error that I 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.900
 they left with so little food so 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.889
 same that I did not know how to do it and I threw 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.889
 very little 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.730
 then we hugged hand again 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.250
 and we are going around and pushing 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.700
 down and at the same time go 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.700
 closing 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.610
 what was left for them 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.050
 and then it starts to surface 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.050
 they begin to give the form 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.840
 how it lends itself to do this well 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.290
 the forms 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.750
 one thing does not have to leave is not 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.650
 perfect 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.400
 although it tastes good, it does not matter 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.140
 the way you have 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.610
 how can you see how good it is being 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.610
 my little girl 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:07.339
 ok then you are ready , we are going to 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.210
 put in the alphabetical commodity and let's 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.949
 to let it sew 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.340
 and then when the 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.650
 we put it to cook and there we 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.960
 let's go see when it is needed 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 flip it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.000
 well let's do another one let's go 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.000
 make the house 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:29.330
 with what we were to do with beans 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.330
 with cheese 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.960
 and the ones that I know that call them the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.210
 revolts because everything is stirred and 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.500
 does the thing equal nothing more than 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.500
 reveal all three ingredients 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.440
 Y 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.990
 then earth 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.509
 it is pressing 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.509
 and from below also this 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.509
 I'm comfortable 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.830
 as I say the water I use it for 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.650
 remove the food that I stay like this 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.569
 over my hand and since I stay like this 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.470
 clean the will of a little bit of 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.980
 oil 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.980
 do not 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.870
 and we are closing it little by little 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.550
 and wants to be the view 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.550
 we will go we go through 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.370
 as you can see this is a good way 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.050
 easy to do and delicious that are left 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.300
 these things 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.080
 I also love more rice like that 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.909
 of corn 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.370
 do not just start here there is a little bit 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.759
 maturity and here it is more transparent 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.759
 that is normal 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.300
 well let's put it in the light 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.650
 from below 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.650
 look what's going 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.880
 what is blanquita 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:15.180
 and things here we already have things be 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.180
 cooking are almost ready 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.980
 well then it was ready now 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.290
 as you start tasting them and then 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.870
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:30.370
 to put it into practice and more than anything 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:35.010
 so you can enjoy this dish this 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.010
 It is accompanied with a chicken salad 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.630
 and the tomato sauce already depending if 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.950
 they like the spicy but then in this 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.140
 occasion neck as I did 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.030
 provisionally and I wanted to teach you this 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.700
 video then we are not going to make the salsita 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.890
 tanned honey but to accompany it 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.020
 Well, it would be much better like that but like 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.790
 I hope you enjoy it and I hope 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.550
 that they share it and then if they liked it 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.950
 because I give away one like then but 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.220
 for the next many thanks until the 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.220
 view
