00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 novelty at volvo the xc90 which has a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 big suv that's stuffed with technologies 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.170
 and especially at the security level yes everything 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.880
 in fact the big highlight of this vehicle 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.530
 as always at volvo 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.289
 it is the equipment package of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.960
 security that really guarantees a 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.650
 maximum 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.199
 tranquility to our serial customers on 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.310
 this vehicle we have the citysafety which is 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.640
 all braking systems 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.140
 automatic volvo it detects the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.189
 vehicles but also pedestrians and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.129
 the cyclists 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.050
 that's something quite new 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.640
 also has a world premiere this 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.290
 automatic braking at intersections 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 the vehicle will be able to detect 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.280
 using the camera that is at the top 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.540
 from the windshield to a tale that makes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.370
 that he is about to cross the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.690
 road from another vehicle and so goes on 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.109
 brake automatically to avoid 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.309
 this collision at intersections 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.079
 also in series on the vehicle is 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.239
 what's called anti-protection 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.609
 road exit tic exit protection 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.199
 route its different equipment that 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.420
 will handle this kind of situation for 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.280
 minimize the risk of injury to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 the driver and his passenger 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.759
 the first element is to detect 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.619
 precisely that we are in this type of 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.030
 situation that we left the roadway and 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.420
 that we are therefore in a situation of 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.220
 risk 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.179
 the second step it's going to be 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.679
 tighten the electric mans 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.140
 seat belt pretensioners 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.179
 and then the third stage it's going to be at 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.619
 level of the seat we have bases to 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.049
 energy absorption and that too 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.189
 a world first that will limit 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.500
 the vertical forces and therefore the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.570
 damage to the spine in 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.729
 damping in fact the body shock on 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.340
 the seat in the event of significant elevation 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.750
 and then to finish if a shock occurs 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 we have a brake pedal that is 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.890
 retractable and there the strength of this system 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 it's that using a mechanism 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.870
 pyrotechnic 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.550
 the brake pedal and as sucked towards 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.660
 the engine block to prevent injuries 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.340
 foot and leg 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.730
 in fact volvo has a goal it's zero 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.230
 died in 2020 so that's 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.300
 actually the stated ambition of 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.950
 volvo and that's the way that go 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.990
 all our safety equipment and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.370
 this strong serial endowment that is 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.650
 one of the strongest today on 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.480
 on the market then it may seem 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.400
 ambitious but in reality it's some 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.380
 thing quite possible it's 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.790
 really what we tend these permits for 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.680
 by our security center in sweden 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.930
 which consisted of experts who moves 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.190
 on the most serious accidents 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.350
 involving a volvo and who using the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.270
 statistics recover and well can 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.380
 set up and develop 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.270
 new equipment that will mitigate 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.320
 these situations in the future and then this 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.970
 will be allowed also by driving 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.780
 autonomous on which we work from 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.280
 important way 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.020
 we already have today in Gothenburg in 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.400
 Sweden a dozen vehicles that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.170
 move completely autonomously 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.550
 in the streets really other 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.800
 situations entirely conventional and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.970
 by 2017 we will have one hundred these 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.580
 vehicles will also allow us to test 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.110
 our technologies and penniless and then 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.920
 a figure that is extremely 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.960
 interesting is the xc60 which is the suv 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.780
 a little smaller than his 90 at 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.120
 volvo which was launched in 2008 and on 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.520
 which today we have zero deaths on board 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.840
 so we see that already we have evidence 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.700
 tangible that we can approach 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.300
 this ambition zero dead or seriously hurt 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 on board a golf course
