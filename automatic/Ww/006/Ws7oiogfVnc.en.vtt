 Hello everyone, welcome to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 my channel today with you again today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'll show you how I do home pedicures 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.850
 conditions really i'm not a professional 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.680
 I do a manicure-pedicure myself 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.180
 I am mistaken somewhere but his case will not be 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.060
 nice to share some of my own 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.070
 tricks of discovery and ideas and if you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.590
 I wonder if you have been waiting for this video 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.630
 then of course you are welcome 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.070
 what's in it and show you how i care 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 their heels are some 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.600
 cream huskies and of course the device for 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.350
 removing roughness today 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350
 I will use 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.030
 well , the very first thing we will do 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.280
 Naturally we will shoot the leftovers 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.670
 our varnish do it with the help 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:07.590
 acetone free nail polish remover 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 and today I will not use 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.220
 steaming them some very tough 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.350
 washcloths I'll just go through with a little 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.140
 quantity and scale but also scrub on 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.630
 based on butter and cocoa to 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.770
 prepare your nails for manicure clean 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.320
 excess dirt and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.220
 and all this I wipe dry dry when 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 relief towels 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.170
 and let our sleeves dry out dry 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.049
 spoons we can proceed more 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.390
 serious artillery and so today 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.450
 first I will try a nail file which 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.399
 made a splash in the market and it is a nail file 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.070
 shawl that copes with 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.049
 rough skin them and this nail file can 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.580
 buy if I'm not mistaken either in the pharmacy 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.580
 either on ozon website 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.709
 washed down the points quite comfortably so I 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.869
 I think that you can easily take your 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.540
 the trip is very important not to rush and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.569
 nail file slowly until 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.640
 your rough skin is not stoch this 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.860
 worth believing and so fast i have 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 pedicure options that do not require 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.260
 some kind of steaming some effort and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.100
 You can easily use even if 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.100
 you are on a trip 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.750
 but 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.159
 and then choose the remnants of the skin with 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.469
 wet towel dipped in warm 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.930
 vodichke and can already proceed to 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.930
 nail clipping and cuticle removal 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.689
 I admit honestly that I love brigades very much 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.150
 my nails are pretty short I donâ€™t know with 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.670
 how is it connected to me never came 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.150
 head to grow longer nails on 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.840
 legs will show lead him refrain and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:17.060
 sticking to my standard 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:18.919
 nail clipping procedure and so on 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.450
 pass a rather rough file for 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.669
 order to smooth out all some 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.569
 roughness roughness after i 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.569
 cut nails 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 so then I will need some mine 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.710
 fat cream or cream and 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.990
 deodorizing effect and of course 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.170
 any cuticle remedy he 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.430
 should moisturize the skin of the feet and 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.430
 accordingly remove the unpleasant smell 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.739
 I usually choose my pedicure 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.269
 somehow bright lacquers 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.130
 this time I decided to stay at 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.520
 coral shade from opi 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.350
 and in general the choice of varnish probably depends on 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.620
 my mood and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.449
 for example, from the season also many 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.850
 others of course periodically commit 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.280
 mistakes and go to the edges of the nail 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.740
 plate but always saves me 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.750
 wand which i wet into liquid and 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.520
 10 lacquer and periodically so correct 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.900
 their 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.720
 nails do not pay attention 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.790
 my feet calluses this pizza 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.790
 as I went very long in ballet shoes 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.759
 then we put a fixative which 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:08.679
 will help to keep the varnish as long as possible 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:08.679
 and also dry it and ready 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.639
 thank you so much for what looked to 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.560
