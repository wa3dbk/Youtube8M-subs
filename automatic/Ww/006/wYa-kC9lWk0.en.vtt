my hair is definitely longer um and I
don't<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.570> due<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.140> many

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
don't know it could be due to so many

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
don't know it could be due to so many
different<00:01:37.350> reasons<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:39.030> condition<00:01:39.810> it's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
different reasons but the condition it's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.210 
different reasons but the condition it's
in<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> fantastic<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:44.070> really
