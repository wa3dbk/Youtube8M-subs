00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
hello today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.760 
hello today I'm going to show you how to
scramble<00:00:11.330> a<00:00:11.629> Rubik's<00:00:12.440> Cube

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
scramble a Rubik's Cube

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.529 
scramble a Rubik's Cube
according<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.190> WCA<00:00:13.850> regulations<00:00:14.799> for

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
according to WCA regulations for

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.850 
according to WCA regulations for
starters<00:00:17.539> we<00:00:17.690> have<00:00:17.869> a<00:00:17.900> few<00:00:18.230> things<00:00:18.440> to<00:00:18.619> cover

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
starters we have a few things to cover

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.929 
starters we have a few things to cover
first<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:21.080> when<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.100> are<00:00:22.279> looking<00:00:22.580> at<00:00:22.669> a<00:00:22.699> cube

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
first so when you are looking at a cube

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.730 
first so when you are looking at a cube
there<00:00:23.509> are<00:00:23.779> six<00:00:24.560> different<00:00:25.039> types<00:00:25.609> of<00:00:25.849> moves

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
there are six different types of moves

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.829 
there are six different types of moves
each<00:00:27.740> face<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.269> designated<00:00:29.269> by<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.390> letter<00:00:29.509> when

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
each face is designated by a letter when

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.720 
each face is designated by a letter when
you're<00:00:29.960> looking<00:00:30.230> at<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.439> scramble<00:00:30.890> for

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
you're looking at the scramble for

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.920 
you're looking at the scramble for
example<00:00:32.260> here<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:33.590> have<00:00:33.620> our<00:00:33.920> top<00:00:34.160> layer<00:00:34.930> which

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
example here we have our top layer which

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.910 
example here we have our top layer which
is<00:00:35.960> going<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.440> be<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:37.220> layer<00:00:37.579> right<00:00:37.880> here

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
is going to be this layer right here

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.880 
is going to be this layer right here
okay<00:00:39.920> that's<00:00:40.130> our<00:00:40.250> top<00:00:40.490> layer<00:00:40.840> then<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:42.410> if<00:00:42.650> we

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
okay that's our top layer then we if we

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.860 
okay that's our top layer then we if we
have<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.400> our<00:00:43.460> top<00:00:43.700> layer<00:00:43.880> this<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.720> going

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
have this is our top layer this is going

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.730 
have this is our top layer this is going
to<00:00:44.960> be<00:00:45.050> our<00:00:45.260> down<00:00:45.830> layer<00:00:46.190> right<00:00:46.700> down<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:47.740> we

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
to be our down layer right down here we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.990 
to be our down layer right down here we
also<00:00:48.920> have<00:00:49.130> our<00:00:49.490> right<00:00:49.910> layer<00:00:50.240> our<00:00:51.610> left<00:00:52.610> layer

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
also have our right layer our left layer

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000 
also have our right layer our left layer
our<00:00:54.700> front<00:00:55.700> layer<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:57.340> our<00:00:58.340> back<00:00:58.640> layer<00:00:59.090> okay

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
our front layer and our back layer okay

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.800 
our front layer and our back layer okay
so<00:01:01.010> there's<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.850> couple<00:01:02.150> different<00:01:02.240> types<00:01:02.660> of

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
so there's a couple different types of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.880 
so there's a couple different types of
moves<00:01:03.020> on<00:01:03.230> these<00:01:04.900> you'll<00:01:05.900> see<00:01:05.990> capital

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
moves on these you'll see capital

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.580 
moves on these you'll see capital
letters<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:08.000> correspond<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.259> far

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
letters that correspond to this so far

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.279 
letters that correspond to this so far
up<00:01:09.740> layer<00:01:09.979> you'll<00:01:10.220> see<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.400> capital<00:01:10.999> u<00:01:11.450> which<00:01:11.719> is

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
up layer you'll see a capital u which is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.440 
up layer you'll see a capital u which is
denoting<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.130> for<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.789> bottom<00:01:14.149> layer

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
denoting this for the bottom layer

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.840 
denoting this for the bottom layer
you'll<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.840> D<00:01:15.140> for<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.890> L<00:01:16.039> or<00:01:16.399> for<00:01:16.789> the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
you'll have a D for the L or for the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.130 
you'll have a D for the L or for the
left<00:01:17.030> side<00:01:17.179> you'll<00:01:17.329> have<00:01:17.450> an<00:01:17.539> L<00:01:17.719> and<00:01:17.899> for<00:01:18.079> the

have a B there are a couple of different

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.730 
have a B there are a couple of different
move<00:01:28.069> possibilities<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.560> see

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
move possibilities with that if you see

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.649 
move possibilities with that if you see
just<00:01:31.069> a<00:01:31.189> capital<00:01:31.399> u<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.270> means<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.539> will

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
just a capital u that means you will

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.300 
just a capital u that means you will
turn<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.960> top<00:01:33.200> 90<00:01:34.009> degrees<00:01:34.640> clockwise<00:01:36.310> okay

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
turn the top 90 degrees clockwise okay

f2 that is 180

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.429 
f2 that is 180
Gries<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.989> with<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.200> knowledge<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:25.439> now

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
Gries so with that knowledge you now

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.660 
Gries so with that knowledge you now
know<00:02:26.590> how<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.769> scramble<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.310> you're<00:02:27.519> probably

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
know how to scramble but you're probably

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.550 
know how to scramble but you're probably
wondering<00:02:28.209> what<00:02:28.329> about<00:02:28.420> faces<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
wondering what about faces like the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.679 
wondering what about faces like the
backside<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.129> which<00:02:30.340> way<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.760> clockwise<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
backside like which way is clockwise and

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.119 
backside like which way is clockwise and
counter<00:02:31.870> clockwise<00:02:31.900> well<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.950> need<00:02:33.099> to

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
counter clockwise well you need to

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.039 
counter clockwise well you need to
imagine<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.790> you're<00:02:33.939> looking<00:02:34.510> at<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.810> face

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
imagine that you're looking at the face

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.670 
imagine that you're looking at the face
so<00:02:35.829> for<00:02:36.730> example<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.720> right<00:02:37.900> face<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.530> is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
so for example the right face this is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.349 
so for example the right face this is
the<00:02:38.799> right<00:02:38.980> face<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.609> if<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.000> see<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> capital

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
the right face here if you see a capital

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.270 
the right face here if you see a capital
R<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.810> want<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.260> imagine<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:42.099> you're

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
R you want to imagine that you're

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.399 
R you want to imagine that you're
looking<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:42.970> face<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.420> then<00:02:44.109> it

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
looking at the right face and then it

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.440 
looking at the right face and then it
turns<00:02:45.099> clockwise<00:02:46.409> just<00:02:47.409> like<00:02:47.650> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:49.090> see<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
turns clockwise just like if you see a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.059 
turns clockwise just like if you see a
capital<00:02:52.450> R<00:02:52.750> followed<00:02:52.930> by<00:02:53.109> Naposki<00:02:53.379> or<00:02:53.799> an<00:02:53.889> R

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
capital R followed by Naposki or an R

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.740 
capital R followed by Naposki or an R
prime<00:02:54.269> imagine<00:02:55.269> you're<00:02:55.359> looking<00:02:55.599> at<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
prime imagine you're looking at the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.319 
prime imagine you're looking at the
right<00:02:55.900> face<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.260> goes<00:02:56.379> counterclockwise<00:02:57.329> so

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
right face and goes counterclockwise so

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.860 
right face and goes counterclockwise so
just<00:02:59.079> like<00:02:59.230> 4b<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> back<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.879> B<00:03:01.389> on<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.629> back

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
just like 4b on the back a B on the back

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.349 
just like 4b on the back a B on the back
would<00:03:02.470> be<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> clockwise<00:03:03.069> turn<00:03:03.310> which<00:03:03.609> is<00:03:03.639> this

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
would be a clockwise turn which is this

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.050 
would be a clockwise turn which is this
and<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.099> looking<00:03:06.430> directly<00:03:06.549> at<00:03:06.879> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
and if you're looking directly at the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.479 
and if you're looking directly at the
face<00:03:07.299> you'll<00:03:07.659> notice<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.200> turns<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.129> same

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
face you'll notice it turns the same

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.960 
face you'll notice it turns the same
direction<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> B<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:12.189> like<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.760> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
direction this is a B this like this and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.020 
direction this is a B this like this and
then<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.959> have<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.139> D<00:03:14.409> down<00:03:14.620> here<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.189> D

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
then you have a D down here a D

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.390 
then you have a D down here a D
clockwise<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.019> be<00:03:17.109> that<00:03:17.319> direction<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.889> deep

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
clockwise to be that direction a deep

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.520 
clockwise to be that direction a deep
REM<00:03:18.609> would<00:03:18.879> be<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.180> direction<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.409> when

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
REM would be this direction so when

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.899 
REM would be this direction so when
you're<00:03:20.650> first<00:03:20.769> starting<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.459> just<00:03:21.609> take

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
you're first starting you can just take

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.430 
you're first starting you can just take
a<00:03:21.939> look<00:03:22.150> at<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.359> cube<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.659> be<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.900> oh<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> need

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
a look at the cube and be like oh I need

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.039 
a look at the cube and be like oh I need
to<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.620> an<00:03:23.739> L<00:03:23.889> move<00:03:24.129> turn<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:25.030> do<00:03:25.540> your<00:03:25.690> L<00:03:25.810> move

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
to do an L move turn it do your L move

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.020 
to do an L move turn it do your L move
and<00:03:26.230> then<00:03:26.500> turn<00:03:26.799> back<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.579> way<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.790> know<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
and then turn back that way you know you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.490 
and then turn back that way you know you
did<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.359> when<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.900> start<00:03:29.199> getting<00:03:29.260> more

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
did it when you start getting more

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.339 
did it when you start getting more
practice<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.129> learn<00:03:30.370> how<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.109> B

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
practice you can learn how that's a B

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.250 
practice you can learn how that's a B
and<00:03:32.739> that's<00:03:33.699> a<00:03:33.879> D<00:03:34.120> prime<00:03:34.480> down<00:03:34.810> there<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.199> you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
and that's a D prime down there and you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.220 
and that's a D prime down there and you
can<00:03:35.379> start<00:03:35.620> using<00:03:35.739> almost<00:03:36.069> finger<00:03:36.459> tricks<00:03:36.699> but

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
can start using almost finger tricks but

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.250 
can start using almost finger tricks but
so<00:03:38.230> now<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:38.500> we've<00:03:38.650> covered<00:03:38.980> basic<00:03:39.489> notation

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
so now that we've covered basic notation

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.569 
so now that we've covered basic notation
what<00:03:41.260> orientation<00:03:41.829> use<00:03:41.949> kind<00:03:42.099> of<00:03:42.159> look<00:03:42.280> Cuban

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
what orientation use kind of look Cuban

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.819 
what orientation use kind of look Cuban
um<00:03:42.760> because<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.810> can't<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.169> pick<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.500> up<00:03:44.680> and

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
um because you can't just pick it up and

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.860 
um because you can't just pick it up and
go<00:03:45.010> there's<00:03:45.639> actually<00:03:46.030> an<00:03:46.090> orientation<00:03:46.540> for

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
go there's actually an orientation for

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.449 
go there's actually an orientation for

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
your green face on front facing you so

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.020 
your green face on front facing you so
this<00:03:56.349> will<00:03:56.500> be<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:56.709> default<00:03:57.030> scrambling

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
this will be your default scrambling

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.039 
this will be your default scrambling
orientation<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.769> cube<00:04:00.040> now<00:04:01.000> let's<00:04:01.840> say

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
orientation on the cube now let's say

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.390 
orientation on the cube now let's say
that<00:04:02.229> there's<00:04:02.440> no<00:04:02.680> white<00:04:02.859> face<00:04:03.069> let's<00:04:03.310> say

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
that there's no white face let's say

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.189 
that there's no white face let's say
they<00:04:03.489> have<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.639> black<00:04:03.879> face<00:04:04.150> instead<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
they have a black face instead of the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.680 
they have a black face instead of the
white<00:04:05.349> face<00:04:05.590> then<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:06.970> need<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.299> find<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
white face then you need to find the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.899 
white face then you need to find the
next<00:04:07.870> lightest<00:04:08.590> color<00:04:08.919> on<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.310> cube<00:04:09.639> so

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
next lightest color on the cube so

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.759 
next lightest color on the cube so
looking<00:04:10.389> around<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.959> next<00:04:11.169> lightest<00:04:11.560> color

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
looking around the next lightest color

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.710 
looking around the next lightest color
is<00:04:11.979> going<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.370> be<00:04:12.430> yellow<00:04:12.699> so<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.389> will<00:04:13.629> be

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
is going to be yellow so that will be

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.830 
is going to be yellow so that will be
our<00:04:13.840> top<00:04:14.079> face<00:04:14.579> then<00:04:15.579> you'll<00:04:16.090> put<00:04:16.389> green<00:04:16.720> on

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
our top face then you'll put green on

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.909 
our top face then you'll put green on
the<00:04:16.930> front<00:04:16.959> again<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.680> would<00:04:17.799> be<00:04:17.859> our

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
the front again and this would be our

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.240 
the front again and this would be our
scrambling<00:04:18.340> orientation<00:04:19.079> now<00:04:20.079> let's<00:04:20.409> say<00:04:20.650> we

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
scrambling orientation now let's say we

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.430 
scrambling orientation now let's say we
have<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.489> white<00:04:21.729> face<00:04:21.909> but<00:04:22.120> no<00:04:22.240> green<00:04:22.479> face<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
have a white face but no green face you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.469 
have a white face but no green face you
will<00:04:23.560> look<00:04:23.800> from<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.820> white<00:04:24.940> face<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.360> the

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
will look from the white face to the

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.649 
will look from the white face to the
nearest<00:04:25.870> adjacent<00:04:26.740> darkest<00:04:27.400> color<00:04:27.639> face<00:04:27.969> so

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
nearest adjacent darkest color face so

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.149 
nearest adjacent darkest color face so
if<00:04:29.050> green<00:04:29.349> is<00:04:29.469> out<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> picture<00:04:29.830> we're

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
if green is out of the picture we're

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.469 
if green is out of the picture we're
gonna<00:04:30.250> look<00:04:30.400> at<00:04:30.550> red<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.479> of<00:04:31.539> light

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
gonna look at red that kind of light

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.269 
gonna look at red that kind of light
that's<00:04:32.930> really<00:04:33.349> dark<00:04:33.529> and<00:04:33.860> then<00:04:34.099> we<00:04:34.159> have

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:34.279 
that's really dark and then we have

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.760 
that's really dark and then we have
orange<00:04:34.969> so<00:04:35.479> since<00:04:35.659> blue<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.259> darkest

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
orange so since blue is the darkest

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.159 
orange so since blue is the darkest
adjacent<00:04:37.279> face<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.819> will<00:04:37.939> be<00:04:38.029> our<00:04:38.120> front<00:04:38.389> so

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
adjacent face that will be our front so

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.330 
adjacent face that will be our front so
if<00:04:39.229> we<00:04:39.289> had<00:04:39.379> a<00:04:39.409> combination<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:40.069> the<00:04:40.129> two<00:04:40.309> and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
if we had a combination of the two and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.850 
if we had a combination of the two and
we<00:04:40.610> didn't<00:04:40.969> have<00:04:41.059> white<00:04:41.389> or<00:04:41.659> green<00:04:42.199> would<00:04:42.650> pick

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
we didn't have white or green would pick

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.589 
we didn't have white or green would pick
the<00:04:43.039> lightest<00:04:43.370> face<00:04:43.580> for<00:04:43.789> top<00:04:43.939> yellow<00:04:44.419> and

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
the lightest face for top yellow and

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.379 
the lightest face for top yellow and
then<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.169> next<00:04:45.469> darkest<00:04:45.830> face<00:04:46.099> adjacent<00:04:46.819> blue

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
then the next darkest face adjacent blue

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.999 
then the next darkest face adjacent blue
and<00:04:47.629> this<00:04:48.050> would<00:04:48.169> be<00:04:48.259> a<00:04:48.289> scramble<00:04:48.529> orientation

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
and this would be a scramble orientation

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.110 
and this would be a scramble orientation
if<00:04:49.069> we<00:04:49.159> had<00:04:49.279> neither<00:04:49.550> white<00:04:49.999> nor<00:04:50.740> green<00:04:51.999> so<00:04:52.999> now

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
if we had neither white nor green so now

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.059 
if we had neither white nor green so now
we<00:04:53.180> have<00:04:53.419> our<00:04:53.449> scramble<00:04:53.900> orientation<00:04:54.379> let's

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
we have our scramble orientation let's

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.390 
we have our scramble orientation let's
do<00:04:56.059> a<00:04:56.089> walk<00:04:56.569> through<00:04:56.599> scramble<00:04:57.259> I<00:04:57.469> have<00:04:58.159> a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
do a walk through scramble I have a

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.719 
do a walk through scramble I have a
scramble<00:04:58.939> here<00:04:59.210> for<00:05:00.139> 3x3<00:05:00.830> from<00:05:01.189> tea<00:05:01.370> noodle

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
scramble here for 3x3 from tea noodle

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.409 
scramble here for 3x3 from tea noodle
and<00:05:01.909> hopefully<00:05:02.809> you<00:05:02.900> guys<00:05:03.050> can<00:05:03.110> see<00:05:03.319> it<00:05:03.699> so<00:05:04.699> we

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
and hopefully you guys can see it so we

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.279 
and hopefully you guys can see it so we
will<00:05:05.599> start<00:05:06.439> our<00:05:06.650> scramble<00:05:07.249> and<00:05:07.509> so<00:05:08.509> again

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
will start our scramble and so again

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.019 
will start our scramble and so again
we're<00:05:09.469> going<00:05:09.589> to<00:05:09.680> start<00:05:09.949> with<00:05:10.159> white<00:05:10.729> on<00:05:10.879> top

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
we're going to start with white on top

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.570 
we're going to start with white on top
and<00:05:11.300> green<00:05:11.539> on<00:05:11.659> front<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.949> first<00:05:13.159> one<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.550> a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
and green on front so the first one is a

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.510 
and green on front so the first one is a
default<00:05:14.120> abide<00:05:14.360> '<00:05:14.960> that<00:05:15.349> is<00:05:15.379> d-prime<00:05:15.949> you'll

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
default abide ' that is d-prime you'll

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.249 
default abide ' that is d-prime you'll
notice<00:05:16.819> that<00:05:16.909> this<00:05:17.060> says<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.509> scramble

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
notice that this says it's scramble

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.429 
notice that this says it's scramble
number<00:05:18.589> one<00:05:19.569> I'll<00:05:20.569> cover<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.110> in<00:05:21.259> a

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
number one I'll cover that in a

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.079 
number one I'll cover that in a
different<00:05:21.560> video<00:05:21.800> so<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.550> first<00:05:22.759> move<00:05:22.939> is<00:05:23.029> a

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
different video so the first move is a

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.820 
different video so the first move is a
deep<00:05:23.389> rhyme<00:05:23.689> so<00:05:24.110> that's<00:05:24.259> going<00:05:24.409> to<00:05:24.469> be<00:05:24.589> a

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
deep rhyme so that's going to be a

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.610 
deep rhyme so that's going to be a
counterclockwise<00:05:25.580> turn<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.930> I'll<00:05:27.259> imagine

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
counterclockwise turn so I'll imagine

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.469 
counterclockwise turn so I'll imagine
I'm<00:05:27.949> looking<00:05:28.339> directly<00:05:28.669> at<00:05:28.879> the<00:05:28.969> down<00:05:29.180> face

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
I'm looking directly at the down face

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.059 
I'm looking directly at the down face
and<00:05:29.719> turn<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.169> counterclockwise<00:05:31.569> help

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
and turn it counterclockwise help

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.170 
and turn it counterclockwise help
counter<00:05:34.069> clockwise<00:05:34.749> then<00:05:35.749> we<00:05:36.529> have<00:05:36.770> an<00:05:37.039> our<00:05:37.729> I

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
counter clockwise then we have an our I

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.489 
counter clockwise then we have an our I
will<00:05:38.749> do<00:05:38.870> an<00:05:38.990> R<00:05:39.759> then<00:05:40.759> we<00:05:40.939> have<00:05:41.120> an<00:05:41.240> L<00:05:41.479> I<00:05:41.810> will<00:05:42.349> do

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:42.499 
will do an R then we have an L I will do

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:47.369 
will do an R then we have an L I will do
an<00:05:42.620> L<00:05:43.749> followed<00:05:44.749> by<00:05:44.899> an<00:05:44.960> F<00:05:45.279> so<00:05:46.279> we'll<00:05:46.490> do<00:05:46.639> an<00:05:46.759> F

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379 
an L followed by an F so we'll do an F

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:53.309 
an L followed by an F so we'll do an F
followed<00:05:48.379> by<00:05:48.560> an<00:05:48.680> R<00:05:48.919> Prime<00:05:50.439> followed<00:05:51.439> by<00:05:51.649> an<00:05:51.949> L

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
followed by an R Prime followed by an L

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.110 
followed by an R Prime followed by an L
followed<00:05:54.319> by<00:05:54.469> a<00:05:54.499> you<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.099> remember<00:05:55.610> YouTube

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
followed by a you to remember YouTube

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.760 
followed by a you to remember YouTube
means<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.509> top<00:05:56.719> turns<00:05:56.990> twice<00:05:57.319> in<00:05:57.560> either

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
means the top turns twice in either

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.559 
means the top turns twice in either
direction<00:05:58.629> then<00:05:59.629> we<00:05:59.779> have<00:05:59.959> an<00:06:00.080> F<00:06:01.300> then<00:06:02.300> we<00:06:02.419> have

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
direction then we have an F then we have

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.619 
direction then we have an F then we have
a<00:06:02.749> d2<00:06:03.319> so<00:06:03.770> turn<00:06:04.129> the<00:06:04.610> bottom<00:06:04.999> twice<00:06:05.240> in<00:06:05.479> any

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
a d2 so turn the bottom twice in any

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.399 
a d2 so turn the bottom twice in any
direction<00:06:06.069> then<00:06:07.069> we<00:06:07.189> have<00:06:07.310> an<00:06:07.430> R<00:06:07.669> Prime

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
direction then we have an R Prime

can't just scramble it and send it off
you<00:06:38.990> actually<00:06:39.409> have<00:06:39.770> to<00:06:39.949> check<00:06:40.159> it<00:06:40.339> so<00:06:41.000> on<00:06:41.389> a

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
you actually have to check it so on a

this<00:07:33.800> is<00:07:34.069> a<00:07:34.129> correctly<00:07:34.669> scrambled<00:07:35.240> cube<00:07:35.479> if<00:07:35.779> it

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:36.769 
this is a correctly scrambled cube if it

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:39.909 
this is a correctly scrambled cube if it
doesn't<00:07:37.459> match<00:07:37.819> you<00:07:38.599> need<00:07:38.750> to<00:07:38.959> solve<00:07:39.349> the<00:07:39.620> cube
