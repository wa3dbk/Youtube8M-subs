these<00:00:51.270> ones<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.750> quite<00:00:51.960> fussy<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.190> don't

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
these ones are quite fussy so they don't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
these ones are quite fussy so they don't
go<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.910> than<00:00:54.090> enemies<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
go in all than enemies so when it a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
go in all than enemies so when it a
clownfish<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.820> goes<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
clownfish first it goes to go into the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.500 
clownfish first it goes to go into the
enemy<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:59.039> needs<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> few

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
enemy it needs to go in and out a few

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
enemy it needs to go in and out a few
times<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.989> build<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> tolerance<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
times to build up a tolerance so it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
times to build up a tolerance so it
doesn't<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.390> stung<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
doesn't get stung because it's got a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
doesn't get stung because it's got a
body<00:01:05.040> slime<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.729> won't<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.180> detected<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.969 
body slime that won't be detected by the
enemy<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.720> clownfish<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.860> all

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
enemy so not all clownfish go into all

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
enemy so not all clownfish go into all
than<00:01:11.189> enemies<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> these<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> fussiest

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
than enemies and these are the fussiest

than enemies and these are the fussiest
of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> clownfish<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
of the clownfish so if you get a

the large one will be the female and the
rest<00:01:56.590> are<00:01:56.710> usually<00:01:57.070> male<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> they<00:02:00.640> basically

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
rest are usually male so they basically

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.080 
rest are usually male so they basically
live<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.870> in<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.110> colony<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:04.000> if

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
live like that in a colony and then if

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.290 
live like that in a colony and then if
the<00:02:04.300> dominant<00:02:04.720> female<00:02:05.260> dies<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
the dominant female dies then the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.480 
the dominant female dies then the
largest<00:02:07.690> most<00:02:08.110> dominant<00:02:08.500> male<00:02:08.830> will<00:02:08.860> turn

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
largest most dominant male will turn

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.010 
largest most dominant male will turn
into<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.820> female<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.510> they<00:02:10.540> can<00:02:10.840> actually

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
into a female so they can actually

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.190 
into a female so they can actually
change<00:02:11.560> sexes<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.330> these<00:02:13.330> fish<00:02:13.600> do<00:02:13.840> very

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
change sexes and these fish do very

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.290 
change sexes and these fish do very
regularly<00:02:14.890> breed<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.490> aquariums<00:02:16.120> you'll

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
regularly breed in aquariums you'll

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.050 
regularly breed in aquariums you'll
often<00:02:16.540> see<00:02:16.900> them<00:02:17.050> lay<00:02:17.230> eggs<00:02:17.640> often<00:02:18.640> just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
often see them lay eggs often just

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.800 
often see them lay eggs often just
behind<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.540> lip<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.840> an<00:02:19.959> an<00:02:20.080> enemy<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:22.600> those

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
behind the lip of an an enemy but those

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930 
behind the lip of an an enemy but those
eggs<00:02:23.170> hardly<00:02:23.650> ever<00:02:23.860> survive<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.550> an<00:02:24.670> aquarium

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
eggs hardly ever survive in an aquarium

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.090 
eggs hardly ever survive in an aquarium
because<00:02:25.630> either<00:02:25.990> worms<00:02:26.350> come<00:02:26.740> out<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> the

because either worms come out of the
rock<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.400> eat<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> eggs<00:02:27.880> or<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> eggs

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
rock and eat the eggs or when the eggs

rock and eat the eggs or when the eggs
hatch<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:31.209> eaten<00:02:31.380> by<00:02:32.380> corals<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.950> fish

hatch they get eaten by corals and fish

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.050 
hatch they get eaten by corals and fish
or<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.630> sucked<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.260> filter<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.060> then

or get sucked into the filter and then
if<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.270> do<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.660> them<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.020> special<00:02:38.200> aquarium

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
if you do put them in a special aquarium

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.160 
if you do put them in a special aquarium
to<00:02:39.040> raise<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.580> babies<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.630> need<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.959> feed

available to most people because they

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.620 
available to most people because they

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
but these are an absolutely spectacular

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.520

must-have<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.480> they<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.630> as<00:03:00.960> I<00:03:01.140> said<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.350> lot

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
must-have and they are as I said a lot

must-have and they are as I said a lot
of<00:03:01.590> people<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:02.070> reading<00:03:02.550> these<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.360> where
