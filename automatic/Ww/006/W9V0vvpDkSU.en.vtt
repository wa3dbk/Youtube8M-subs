00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.360
 Thank you Hello, everyone slowly 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:12.380
 It is this time that it is the third video single shot video 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:18.380
 We will continue to the introduction of mod called door Mod 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.370
 The streets all kinds of door of the name will be added to that door Mod 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.039
 Door design with it yourself 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:30.649
 You can decide the staff and how to move, etc. You can make the original door 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.519
 This from next to this is an item added by putting a door mod 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.710
 is 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:42.809
 Right click 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:46.460
 It's like a castle door rather than a door that opens like this A loud door opens like a sound 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.310
 It sounds like a key 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 Next is Kore 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.390
 This will slide to the left by right clicking 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.110
 Restaurants and the like Kano automatic door 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 Even if there is a block next to it, it slides properly 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 There is also a spider version of the slide door 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.000
 It can be opened with the lever or button in the same way as an ordinary iron door 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 Like this 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.190
 This door is almost the same as an iron sliding door 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.610
 Sounds like jailhouses 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.610
 I'm like a prison 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 This door slides up 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 Cool 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:49.530
 Of course it slides even if there is a block on the top 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 This door slides up and down 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.550
 Like this 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.550
 I think it is cool to connect two 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.780
 It This is caused rather than a door 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.990
 It can be used for Japanese style architecture 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 It looks like a curtain fitting room 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.580
 There I opened the curtain there was a villager 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.580
 Scold 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.690
 This is good parentheses I feel likely come out stairs leading to the basement 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.110
 This is used also connect many pieces thing that the garage door 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.230
 It will move in the garage door lever or button 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.230
 Open like a car garage 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.880
 It looks like something like cotton 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.540
 You can use this to make an original door 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:08.610
 We decide how to open the door here 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.610
 I do not understand well, so I will make it appropriate 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.280
 Here is a place to put three blocks 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.970
 First decide how to open 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.819
 Light blue wool with a light here 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.940
 So Then, to the door of the design that combines the three blocks placed now puts the left bank 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.270
 Become 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.270
 I wonder if something like this was too little appropriate 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.210
 You can change the design, change the way you open, and create many types of doors 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.060
 Asuka but this is disgusting 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.050
 When I put three wools 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.960
 It will be a door that feels pretty 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.930
 I tried to make a door with only stone bricks 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.930
 It looks like it can be used as a hidden door 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.040
 I will try to change the way the door is opened 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.410
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:18.890
 What a great move 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.890
 I will forget the position of the door if there is no mark 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:28.879
 Let's change the movement again and make it 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.879
 At making something door has become fun 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.280
 I heard something heavy 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:46.809
 Apparently the number here is the time until the door opens 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:52.979
 In other words, if this number is increased, it takes time until the door opens 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:52.979
 The smaller the number, the opposite is 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.090
 It seems that you can adjust the time until the door opens like this 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:14.370
 This door is a great move too 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:17.729
 If I make a door all the way like this, I will finish in this area because there is no penetration 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:26.160
 It was an introduction of the door mod

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.110

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.400
 Is 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.400
