00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.740
 that boys and girls today we will talk about 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.350
 mythical japanese monster koichi the one that goes 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.299
 to appear within nothing in this month of 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.969
 July surely when the video comes up 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.440
 will already be in the market or I do not know it anymore 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.890
 that the game is not not that he has had 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.560
 Well, a lot of popularity as the movie 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.960
 since it is a game as independent it is 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.599
 of the band company and good of those who 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.699
 are those that distribute the game and are 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.540
 those who have good like that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.910
 permission of this game the game in theory 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.610
 no no is not like him from game in the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.640
 movie the character is as set and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.780
 its morphology is like that of the 80s 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.870
 and 90 of godzilla the game is extremely 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.280
 strange and how very poor in terms of 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.559
 visualization surely there in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.040
 screen you are going to see the version very 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.350
 rough 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.960
 so I read the demo regarding 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.240
 control of managing the characters and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.790
 that there are three is very difficult to manage 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.100
 those to move and such those threads 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.980
 these big gentlemen showed 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 they hold their attacks as their 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.590
 special moves the game then 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.600
 will consist of different levels like 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.270
 different locations at the same time 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.150
 they have as a touch yes weird that gives 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.479
 Wanting to play is like a shit game 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.000
 I do not know is a game in plan that would be 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.850
 such is no longer interested 20 sense 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.470
 to train us would give us ten euros or 20 x 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 because the two of you have it in a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.160
 interesting catalog and one to all we 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 like to destroy things but in terms of 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.530
 mechanical so it looks and I do not know how 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.320
 the budget that has new is not that 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.900
 has been invested in a I do not know just been 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.940
 used in the kitchen name the rest 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.580
 since nothing has been invested so 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.610
 that you see on screen and for what I've 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.229
 read review ciutat hope it is not 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.229
 a tremendous poop
