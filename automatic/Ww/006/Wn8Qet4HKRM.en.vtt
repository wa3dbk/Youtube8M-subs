00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
think the ending should have been a tiny

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.580 
think the ending should have been a tiny
bit<00:03:15.910> more<00:03:15.940> dramatic<00:03:16.330> or<00:03:16.900> sun<00:03:17.110> glad<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.440> but

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.009 
one thing that i noticed in this game
altogether<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:49.239> it's<00:03:49.510> quite<00:03:49.750> repetitive

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
altogether is it's quite repetitive

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.190 
altogether is it's quite repetitive
regarding<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.220> combat<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.880> fighting<00:03:52.390> you're

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
regarding the combat the fighting you're

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.600 
regarding the combat the fighting you're
pretty<00:03:53.380> much<00:03:53.440> doing<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.920> same<00:03:54.160> move<00:03:54.400> so

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
pretty much doing this same move so

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.670 
pretty much doing this same move so
you're<00:03:54.730> doing<00:03:54.940> button<00:03:55.239> bashing<00:03:55.600> most<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.440> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
you're doing button bashing most of the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
you're doing button bashing most of the
time<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.190> for<00:03:57.790> some<00:03:57.970> people<00:03:58.000> they<00:03:58.330> might<00:03:58.600> find

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
time and for some people they might find

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.300 
time and for some people they might find
that<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.110> little<00:03:59.320> bit<00:03:59.500> repetitive<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.250> boring

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
that a little bit repetitive and boring

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.310 
that a little bit repetitive and boring
but<00:04:00.670> for<00:04:00.820> me<00:04:00.940> that's<00:04:01.090> absolutely<00:04:01.660> fine<00:04:01.900> i<00:04:01.959> like

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
but for me that's absolutely fine i like

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.960 
but for me that's absolutely fine i like
doing<00:04:02.530> all<00:04:02.799> these<00:04:02.950> combat<00:04:03.400> moves<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.910> you

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
doing all these combat moves and you

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.190 
doing all these combat moves and you
can't<00:04:04.239> i<00:04:04.330> guess<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.690> could<00:04:04.810> say<00:04:04.989> it's<00:04:05.140> a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
can't i guess you could say it's a

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.750 
can't i guess you could say it's a
little<00:04:05.410> bit<00:04:05.560> guided<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.160> what<00:04:06.340> buttons<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760
