the base and wax it in the freezer you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
the base and wax it in the freezer you
can<00:01:00.390> put<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> freezer<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> sets<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
can put it in the freezer so it sets a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
can put it in the freezer so it sets a
little<00:01:02.250> quicker<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.090> other<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.449> we're

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
little quicker now your other one we're

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
little quicker now your other one we're
going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> slightly<00:01:04.350> paler<00:01:04.739> color

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
going to make it a slightly paler color

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.649 
going to make it a slightly paler color
so<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.489> poured<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.180> bit<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.299> yogurt

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so I poured in a little bit of yogurt

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.940 
so I poured in a little bit of yogurt
and<00:01:06.869> mix<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> could<00:01:07.830> use

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and mix that through but you could use

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
and mix that through but you could use
condensed<00:01:08.369> milk<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.150> milk<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.930> mix<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
condensed milk or milk and just mix it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.480 
condensed milk or milk and just mix it
through<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> nice<00:01:10.920> pale<00:01:11.220> colour

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
through so you got a nice pale colour

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
through so you got a nice pale colour
after<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:12.030> 20<00:01:12.360> minutes<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:13.049> layer

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
after about 20 minutes your first layer

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
after about 20 minutes your first layer
of<00:01:13.439> jelly<00:01:13.860> slash<00:01:14.250> jello<00:01:14.520> should<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> nice

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
little skin on it which will allow the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
little skin on it which will allow the
second<00:01:17.070> layer<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.700> poured<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.869> do

that and then whack it straight back in

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
that and then whack it straight back in
the<00:01:20.880> freezer<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> boring<00:01:22.530> step

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the freezer now here is the boring step

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
the freezer now here is the boring step
you've<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.030> every<00:01:24.450> single
