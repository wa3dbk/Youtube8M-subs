'GET IN SHAPE WITH JANE FONDA'

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.020
Sugar!!

00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:17.423
Sometimes I get sugar cravings at night

00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:20.223
You too? Welcome to the club!

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:24.543
If you really have to eat something sweet...I'll give you a nice alternative that won't ruin your gains

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:25.743
Protein Fluff !

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.935
So simple and yummy at the same time...

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:30.935
We'll need only 3 ingredients

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:34.055
Protein - I like vanilla because it's a more neutral taste

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.460
Some Milk - either soy, almond or rice is fine as well

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320
And some frozen fruit

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520
I love banana..but you can...

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.680
And some frozen fruit...I'll use a banana but you can choose other fruits

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.180
Like strawberries, blueberries, peaches, mangoes...

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.520
I cut the banana in pieces to make it easier

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740
1 scoop protein

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.020
Just a little milk...you can add more if you want it more runny

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.960
Let's whisk it from 3 to 5 minutes maximum potency

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.040
And there you go! Sweet and creamy

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.520
Excellent post workout meal

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
