to<00:04:37.880> go<00:04:38.030> right<00:04:38.419> there<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.380> there<00:04:40.150> see<00:04:41.150> on<00:04:41.270> my

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
to go right there and there see on my

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.700 
to go right there and there see on my
map<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:42.710> once<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.190> do<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:44.680> cut<00:04:45.680> that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
map and then once you do that cut that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.220 
map and then once you do that cut that
off<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:48.460> then<00:04:49.460> make<00:04:49.760> sure<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.169> thing

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
off and then make sure that this thing

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.909 
off and then make sure that this thing
goes<00:04:51.650> into<00:04:51.919> that<00:04:52.100> slot<00:04:53.229> now<00:04:54.229> cut<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.650> other

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
goes into that slot now cut the other

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.030 
goes into that slot now cut the other
thing<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.930> then<00:04:57.050> land<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.500> top<00:04:57.770> of

thing on this and then land on top of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.700 
thing on this and then land on top of
them<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.150> creates<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.780> straight<00:05:00.169> platform

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710
