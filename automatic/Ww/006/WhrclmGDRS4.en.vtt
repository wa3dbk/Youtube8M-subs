people have asked me to show how I make
these<00:00:06.779> little<00:00:07.080> crosses<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:08.370> just<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
these little crosses I'm just going to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.480 
these little crosses I'm just going to
show<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.570> quick<00:00:10.200> video<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.040> knew

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
show you a quick video of how I knew

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610 
show you a quick video of how I knew
that<00:00:11.540> but<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.750> started<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> piece<00:00:13.440> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that but I started out with a piece of

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.810 
that but I started out with a piece of
wood<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:14.960> lower<00:00:15.960> over<00:00:16.170> three<00:00:16.440> inches<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
wood just lower over three inches and I

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.040 
wood just lower over three inches and I
think<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> 3/8<00:00:19.490> square<00:00:20.900> that's<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
think it's a 3/8 square that's the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070 
think it's a 3/8 square that's the
diameter<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> length<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> stick<00:00:24.300> but

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
diameter and the length of the stick but

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.380 
diameter and the length of the stick but
after<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.439> take<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.670> pieces<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
after I take get pieces like that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
after I take get pieces like that
I'm<00:00:27.570> able<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.550> take<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> piece<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> wood

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I'm able to then take a piece of wood

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.020 
I'm able to then take a piece of wood
put<00:00:30.539> ten<00:00:31.260> cuts<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> after<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> make<00:00:32.850> my

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
put ten cuts in it and after I make my

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180 
put ten cuts in it and after I make my
tenth<00:00:33.270> cuts<00:00:33.540> I'll<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.320> open<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
tenth cuts I'll actually open up like a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.000 
tenth cuts I'll actually open up like a
cross<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> show<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
cross so that's one want to show you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.790 
cross so that's one want to show you
right<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> how<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> cross<00:00:40.469> out

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
right now is how I can make a cross out

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.850 
right now is how I can make a cross out
of<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> piece<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> wood<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.110> so

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of just a piece of wood like this so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.310 
of just a piece of wood like this so
we'll<00:00:44.820> watch<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> video<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we'll watch this video now show the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.690 
we'll watch this video now show the
different<00:00:46.620> steps<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.980> how<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:49.700> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
different steps on how to do that this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060 
different steps on how to do that this
is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.940> knife<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.410> exacto<00:00:52.860> knife

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is a knife I use it's an exacto knife

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.150 
is a knife I use it's an exacto knife
and<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> sharp<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> razor<00:00:55.469> blade<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and it is sharp as a razor blade you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
and it is sharp as a razor blade you
have<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.579> very<00:00:56.789> careful<00:00:57.210> using<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> knife

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
have to be very careful using a knife

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.910 
have to be very careful using a knife
like<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.940> what<00:00:59.940> I'll<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.920> start

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
like this what I'll do is I will start

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
like this what I'll do is I will start
with<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> piece<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> wood<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.090> cut

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
with the piece of wood and the first cut

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
with the piece of wood and the first cut
is<00:01:06.770> cut<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:12.380> all<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> way

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is cut all the way through all the way

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
is cut all the way through all the way
through<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> stick<00:01:14.130> I'll<00:01:14.640> make<00:01:14.939> sure<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
through the stick I'll make sure it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.670 
through the stick I'll make sure it's
coming<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> other<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
coming through on the other side and

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
coming through on the other side and
I'll<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> same<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.640> parallel<00:01:21.119> cut

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I'll do the same thing a parallel cut

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.190 
I'll do the same thing a parallel cut
next<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:23.540> see<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> comes<00:01:24.840> through<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
next to it see it comes through on the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
next to it see it comes through on the
other<00:01:25.350> side<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:28.820> after<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.240> two

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
other side also after I make these two

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.859 
other side also after I make these two
parallel<00:01:31.110> cuts<00:01:31.700> I'm<00:01:32.700> gonna<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.630> an

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
parallel cuts I'm gonna go in at an

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.609 
parallel cuts I'm gonna go in at an
angle<00:01:34.079> right<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> those<00:01:35.520> cuts<00:01:38.540> so

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
angle right at the top of those cuts so

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.780 
angle right at the top of those cuts so
the<00:01:40.619> cut<00:01:40.920> will<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> I'll

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the cut will look like this and I'll

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.260 
the cut will look like this and I'll
flip<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> over<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> I'll<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> same<00:01:43.320> thing

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
flip it over and I'll do the same thing

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.719 
flip it over and I'll do the same thing
and<00:01:45.270> I'll<00:01:45.390> flip<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> stick<00:01:46.079> around<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.729> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and I'll flip the stick around and I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.899 
and I'll flip the stick around and I'm
gonna<00:01:47.970> go<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> way<00:01:48.509> through<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> again

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
gonna go all the way through and again

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.440 
gonna go all the way through and again
I'll<00:01:51.030> come<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> other<00:01:52.950> side<00:01:54.710> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
I'll come back out on the other side and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.850 
I'll come back out on the other side and
another<00:01:57.450> parallel<00:01:57.960> cut<00:01:58.439> next<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> it<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
another parallel cut next to it and I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.940 
another parallel cut next to it and I
will<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> same<00:02:03.390> angled<00:02:04.020> cut<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
will then do the same angled cut on this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.720 
will then do the same angled cut on this
side

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:18.110 

so<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.810> cuts<00:02:13.050> look<00:02:13.320> like<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.920> far<00:02:17.120> my

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so the cuts look like this so far my

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.690 
so the cuts look like this so far my
next<00:02:18.420> cut<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:21.150> cut<00:02:22.010> down<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.400> line

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
next cut is to cut down to that line

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.320 
next cut is to cut down to that line
right<00:02:24.270> there<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.610> I'll<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.540> four

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
right there and I'll do that on all four

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.130 
right there and I'll do that on all four
of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.720> angles<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.450> I'll<00:02:33.450> do<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.720> same<00:02:33.900> thing

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
of the angles and I'll do the same thing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.059 
of the angles and I'll do the same thing
right<00:02:34.170> here

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.750 

so<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.090> stick<00:02:43.719> looks<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.829> this<00:02:47.760> I'm

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
so now that stick looks like this I'm

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.229 
so now that stick looks like this I'm
gonna<00:02:48.939> cut<00:02:49.239> on<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.510> inside<00:02:50.319> here<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:52.090> make

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
gonna cut on the inside here to make

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.660 
gonna cut on the inside here to make
sure<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:52.870> got<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.500> angles<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.579> way

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
sure that I got the angles all the way

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.309 
sure that I got the angles all the way
done<00:02:56.819> on<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.969> inside<00:03:00.959> basically<00:03:01.959> what<00:03:02.260> I'm

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
done on the inside basically what I'm

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.190 
done on the inside basically what I'm
doing<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.680> I'm<00:03:02.799> taking<00:03:03.069> my<00:03:03.129> knife<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.579> and

now my next cut come on just cut right
along<00:03:25.050> this<00:03:25.710> side<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.960> kind<00:03:27.960> of<00:03:28.080> mark<00:03:28.380> where

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
along this side here kind of mark where

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.460 
along this side here kind of mark where
it's<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:30.420> I'll<00:03:30.960> flip<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.380> do

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
it's going to go and I'll flip and do

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.920 
it's going to go and I'll flip and do
the<00:03:31.590> same<00:03:31.800> thing<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> other<00:03:32.190> side<00:03:35.930> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the same thing on the other side and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.120 
the same thing on the other side and
I'll<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:38.780> longer<00:03:40.640> side<00:03:42.590> flip<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.740> do<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
I'll do the longer side flip it do the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.949 
I'll do the longer side flip it do the
same<00:03:44.160> thing

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:04:00.860 

so<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:52.030> see<00:03:52.269> one<00:03:52.450> side<00:03:52.689> looks<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:52.959> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900 

now<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.080> marked<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.860> just<00:04:03.340> kind<00:04:03.640> of<00:04:03.730> make

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
now that marked it I just kind of make

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.830 
now that marked it I just kind of make
sure<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.360> done<00:04:04.830> in<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.920> correct<00:04:06.190> spot<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
sure that's done in the correct spot and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.090 
sure that's done in the correct spot and
I'll<00:04:07.990> do<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.440> same<00:04:08.680> thing<00:04:08.860> with<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
I'll do you the same thing with the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:37.090 
I'll do you the same thing with the
bottom<00:04:09.460> part<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.000> cross

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:49.209 

and<00:04:37.580> then<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.030> have<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.300> opened<00:04:38.690> up

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.899 

I<00:04:49.249> clean<00:04:50.029> it<00:04:50.059> out<00:04:50.239> a<00:04:50.300> little<00:04:50.479> bit<00:04:50.659> I<00:04:51.520> just<00:04:52.520> slide

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
I clean it out a little bit I just slide

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.839 
I clean it out a little bit I just slide
it<00:04:53.059> back<00:04:53.209> and<00:04:53.389> move<00:04:53.509> it<00:04:53.659> up<00:04:53.779> like<00:04:54.739> your<00:04:54.889> cross

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.499 

the<00:04:58.849> final<00:04:59.209> step<00:04:59.449> is<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.499> cut<00:05:00.860> off<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:02.330> bottom

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
the final step is to cut off the bottom

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:15.129 
the final step is to cut off the bottom
part<00:05:10.119> there<00:05:11.119> we<00:05:11.269> have<00:05:11.509> a<00:05:11.919> wooden<00:05:12.919> cross<00:05:13.899> it<00:05:14.899> has

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
part there we have a wooden cross it has

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.809 
part there we have a wooden cross it has
the<00:05:15.499> moving<00:05:15.830> part<00:05:16.189> that<00:05:16.759> will<00:05:16.879> open<00:05:16.939> it<00:05:17.149> close

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
the moving part that will open it close

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:29.110 
the moving part that will open it close
and<00:05:19.819> it's<00:05:20.029> close<00:05:25.629> there<00:05:26.629> do<00:05:26.809> something
