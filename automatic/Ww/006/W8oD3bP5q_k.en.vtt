00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:11.370
 Today is a play Denon's headphones ah gc 20, scheduled for release in late April 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.500
 It is an introduction 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:21.970
 This is a product that has been very much watched since it was announced 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.150
 In the drink's demonstration machine at you, but First of all design we were able to borrow from this time 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.220
 But I think this is a good parentheses without complaint 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:36.210
 It is very bitter or say I think that it is a cool design in modern 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:40.660
 I wondered if I 'm targeting that 30's 40's man but I thought for myself 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.960
 I think I can blend in a suit without discomfort 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.090
 Strange place 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:51.940
 I thought that it would be better if the target was not counting 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.650
 Especially this part 8 It seems that it is made of aluminum die cast, but this curvaceous beauty 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.710
 I can not wait 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:02.530
 This time also I think that also took money 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.519
 It is how to fold , but at first this can be flat and stored flat 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.190
 I can 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.950
 Even in such Fu 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.950
 You can do it then 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.340
 You can make it so small and compact 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.120
 I'm new to this kind of folding headphones, but this is more useful than you might imagine 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.900
 Guess I Tteyuu was better 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.200
 For example, this is a Sony headphone but it can be flat 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 I can, but I can not make it smaller than this 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 In the case of Denon 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 It will be compact to here, so I say this , even with a small bag 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.820
 I get in 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:49.670
 After all when we go out we wear headphones when we go well, but we went 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.060
 I thought it would be nice to be able to make this small and compact , as storage at 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.060
 When attached 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:04.080
 It becomes something like Day and first here in a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.800
 The general of the volume can be adjusted, and then it is here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.610
 Then stop playing this song at this little boy 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.460
 You can fast forward something on the station and you are here 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.300
 You can turn noise canceling on and off 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.900
 It has a button to answer the call in here from the left in 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900
 Like this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 Yes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.329
 There are two major functional features, one is bluetooth and you can listen to it wirelessly 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.590
 It means 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:44.609
 Cable I e it is that you do not need is a for a long time 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:46.060
 very sound quality because we firmly support the codec called aptx after Apt x 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:52.360
 To say that is good 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:59.500
 In addition to that, it also supports aptx low latency 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:05.260
 It's planning that the latency, ie, delay is very small so for something game 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.050
 This is not only the receiver but also this kind of smartphone 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.890
 Send 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:15.680
 It is necessary for the side to correspond, too, but unfortunately it corresponds to Abt x old age angel in the country now 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:22.640
 There seems to be almost none 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:26.040
 However, since it seems that the chip can be handled by updating as it is, from now on apt x old age 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.240
 There are more and more devices that support angels 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.390
 Can be great 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.820
 By the way, nfc is not installed, so just connect this Sony like 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.930
 I'm not able to say to 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.230
 This is a bit disappointing 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.680
 The second feature is noise canceling 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:51.069
 This is not the outer two microphone and in this housing with and stuck to the very 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 Each one is to do the best processing 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.120
 So it 's very suitable for listening on the train, in the plane, etc. 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 I think 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:08.239
 About noise canceling performer e in the video of Mr. earphone 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.780
 The developers of the furnace came out and it was very easy to understand, but some details have been explained. 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.050
 I will 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.940
 I 'll put a link below, so please check that if you like more than Denon ah 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.200
 It was introduction of gc 20 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.620
 Hmm 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.620
 Well then 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:32.849
 What does it mean to finish here ? 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:37.949
 We're talking about that bottom line of sound quality Wadoenen 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:44.380
 In but I was able to embezzle this for three weeks near almost every day 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.650
 I How nice to do honest very trouble if I tell the impressions 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.870
 I will 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:54.210
 The maker 's color is with other companies' products 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.330
 It is said that you have a good review including such sound comparison. 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.440
 so 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.630
 I think that you want to go here 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:10.100
 By the way 1 rbt is quite contrasting with 2 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.100
 I think that I want to go through such stories twice
