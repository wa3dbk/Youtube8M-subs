is<00:05:23.180> such<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.509> different<00:05:23.960> thing<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.380> I've<00:05:24.500> kind

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
is such a different thing that I've kind

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.610 
is such a different thing that I've kind
of<00:05:25.370> learned<00:05:26.030> to<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> last<00:05:26.659> year<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.199> I<00:05:27.470> do

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
of learned to the last year and I do

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.010 
of learned to the last year and I do
truly<00:05:28.280> love<00:05:28.520> myself<00:05:28.759> now<00:05:29.240> and<00:05:29.509> I<00:05:29.570> think<00:05:29.659> that's

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
truly love myself now and I think that's

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.950 
truly love myself now and I think that's
why<00:05:30.320> my<00:05:30.789> skin<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.120> my<00:05:32.300> looks<00:05:32.539> and<00:05:32.840> all

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
why my skin and just my looks and all

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.480 
why my skin and just my looks and all
this<00:05:33.110> stuff<00:05:33.229> is<00:05:33.500> not<00:05:33.680> important<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.370> me

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
this stuff is not important to me

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.870 
this stuff is not important to me
anymore

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
anymore

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.149 
anymore
and<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.509> think<00:05:35.750> confidence<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.470> what<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.889> is

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
and I think confidence is what that is

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.550 
and I think confidence is what that is
confidence<00:05:37.880> is<00:05:38.090> loving<00:05:38.479> yourself<00:05:38.599> and<00:05:39.229> that

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
confidence is loving yourself and that

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.300 
confidence is loving yourself and that
just<00:05:39.830> radiates<00:05:40.280> through<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:41.740> this<00:05:42.740> confidence

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
just radiates through so this confidence

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.820 
just radiates through so this confidence
