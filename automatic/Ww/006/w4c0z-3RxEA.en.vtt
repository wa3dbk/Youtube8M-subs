00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
for a while you know used to be in a DMR

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.799 
for a while you know used to be in a DMR
looking<00:00:10.929> a<00:00:11.280> kind<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.400> got<00:00:12.549> old<00:00:12.789> with<00:00:13.059> me<00:00:13.269> so<00:00:13.570> I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
looking a kind of got old with me so I

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.350 
looking a kind of got old with me so I
decided<00:00:14.650> to<00:00:14.860> do<00:00:15.039> it<00:00:15.190> in<00:00:15.279> a<00:00:15.369> carbine<00:00:15.820> length<00:00:15.879> at

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
decided to do it in a carbine length at

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.860 
decided to do it in a carbine length at
first<00:00:16.600> I<00:00:16.810> was<00:00:17.020> going<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.440> do<00:00:17.650> an<00:00:17.920> sbr<00:00:18.870> but

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
first I was going to do an sbr but

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.350 
first I was going to do an sbr but
already<00:00:20.230> had<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.530> few<00:00:20.830> s<00:00:21.010> be<00:00:21.250> ours<00:00:21.460> so<00:00:22.270> I<00:00:22.300> figured

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
already had a few s be ours so I figured

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.050 
already had a few s be ours so I figured
I<00:00:22.660> go<00:00:22.690> ahead<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:23.050> stay<00:00:23.320> with<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.860> carbine<00:00:24.310> so

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
I go ahead and stay with the carbine so

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.850 
I go ahead and stay with the carbine so
let's<00:00:25.270> discuss<00:00:25.780> what's<00:00:26.080> on<00:00:26.289> here<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:26.710> what

things and step them up to a new level
and<00:05:20.650> i'm<00:05:20.919> learning<00:05:21.430> how<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:21.760> do<00:05:21.970> this<00:05:22.090> every

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
and i'm learning how to do this every

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.460 
and i'm learning how to do this every
day<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.900> learn<00:05:23.530> something<00:05:23.590> new<00:05:24.070> every<00:05:24.460> day<00:05:24.490> and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
day I learn something new every day and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.900 
day I learn something new every day and
but<00:05:26.470> there's<00:05:26.680> ways<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.130> do<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.820> don't

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
but there's ways to do it and you don't

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.300 
but there's ways to do it and you don't
have<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.210> spend<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.599> ton<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.810> money<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.289> do<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.590> so

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
have to spend a ton of money to do it so

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.969 
have to spend a ton of money to do it so
the<00:05:30.520> next<00:05:30.550> step<00:05:30.880> will<00:05:31.300> be<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:32.260> quality<00:05:32.740> steel

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
the next step will be the quality steel

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.060 
the next step will be the quality steel
