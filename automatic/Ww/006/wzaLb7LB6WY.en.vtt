00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 strategic thinking develops in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 people from early childhood when they 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.320

 jumped around you and so man 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 It grows and someone develops this skill and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
 further and someone and no game genre 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 strategies the best way is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 do in our time is new chess 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 generations of beautiful games that can 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 literally take us to the present 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 the battlefield this year is waiting for us a few 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 good games in this genre and therefore 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 let's look at them one of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 oldest series of strategy genre games 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 total war this year brought us 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 new part of attila which we can 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.570
 choose one of the parties never great 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.700
 roman empire 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 or eastern leader attila with a million 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.420
 riders striving to rome game 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.219
 divided into two parts step by step strategy 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 on the global map where we will decide 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 important political social and military 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 questions and on the tactical part of the game in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.229
 real time where we will push 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 foreheads army millionaire innovation 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.250
 the game allows you to literally destroy everything 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.140
 what you see with the power of new guns 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 literally burn and compare earth 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.540
 cities and villages 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 unless of course you want them yourself 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.799
 subordinate to the other side what it is about 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 if you play as a nomad mechanic 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.759
 the game has been improved and the threshold of entry 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 reduced by good tutorials however 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 the political part of the game will make you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.549
 sweat new intrigue make you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.650
 think a hundred steps forward very 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.650
 beautiful deep and high-quality game 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 This game will introduce to the world of high tech where 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 in the struggle for domination three converge 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.140
 space empires struggle and and for 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 possession over a very important resource and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 film controlling resources and expanding 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
 your colonies in the mission process 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.390
 you thereby expand the boundaries of control 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 on the map and get the opportunity to collect 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.110
 a mighty army capable of crushing 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 there are three enemies waiting for us in this game 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.619
 unique companies all this of course 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.390
 vaguely resembles a fake on 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.040
 starcraft but developers can 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 forgive the whole even though they copied 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.969
 certain elements of the game have added no 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.799
 a lot of your example you can 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.840
 manage the weather that may affect 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.129
 the outcome of the battle and this is just one of the interesting 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.129
 chips these real time strategies 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 and this is a strategy at first 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.760
 will seem to us a clone of the total war series 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.159
 but no, I can safely tell you what it is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.349
 completely different game and it is very good 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.569
 in the game we will be in the open spaces of Europe 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.069
 thousandth years of our era about affordable 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.709
 the whole map will be known in those times 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.719
 from england to portugal and to africa everything 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.549
 it will be possible in this strategy we 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.049
 We will be in the city that you choose to 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.299
 start and start developing it 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.370
 it goes without saying that you will begin to explore 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.590
 what is there nearby and find your 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.269
 new trading friends after that can 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.310
 start developing your state and 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.019
 rebuild another city then you 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.939
 there may be an army and it will be possible 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.010
 start your struggle for survival in this 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.780
 cruel world of the middle ages but not only 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.400
 wars of another country will be yours 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.609
 enemies but also weather disasters 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.049
 such as thunderstorms volcanic explosions 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.730
 floods and even urban epidemics 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.680
 therefore, they will also have to be attributed 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.510
 syoss and the most interesting and important 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.700
 difference from the total war series here 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.439
 absolutely everything goes in real time mode 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.180
 there is no division of the game into two parts and you 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.950
 you can always look at one part 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.870
 the world and find out what's going on in the foggy 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.969
 Albion while your warriors will 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.260
 leave nomads from the east very 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.959
 worthy parallel worth the attention 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.989
 even those who are fans of the total series 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.989
 war 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.129
 This is truly a legendary series of games in 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.169
 she is already twenty this year 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.479

 the amount of power hungry rivals 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.549
 Dyuk Ivan convenes a consultation of six 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.769
