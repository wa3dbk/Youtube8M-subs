00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
right today's issue I'm having is that

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
right today's issue I'm having is that
my<00:00:08.030> check<00:00:09.030> engine<00:00:09.210> light<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.910> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
my check engine light is on and it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.259 
my check engine light is on and it's
saying<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.509> my<00:00:12.769> vent<00:00:13.769> purge<00:00:14.130> solenoid<00:00:14.670> for

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
saying that my vent purge solenoid for

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.750 
saying that my vent purge solenoid for
the<00:00:16.910> evap<00:00:18.050> back<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:21.260> gas<00:00:22.260> tank<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the evap back here by the gas tank is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.990 
the evap back here by the gas tank is
bad<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.460> through<00:00:26.789> there

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
bad you kind of see it up through there

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
bad you kind of see it up through there
that's<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.289> there<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> whenever<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that's right there but whenever I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
that's right there but whenever I
disconnected<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.329> electrical<00:00:36.329> connector<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
disconnected the electrical connector I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.970 
disconnected the electrical connector I
found<00:00:38.329> this<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:40.280> could<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.579> well<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:42.980> my

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
found this which could very well be my

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.779 
found this which could very well be my
problem

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
problem

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
problem
yikes<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:47.149> fuel<00:00:49.280> readings<00:00:50.280> weren't

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
yikes also my fuel readings weren't

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
yikes also my fuel readings weren't
exactly<00:00:51.210> right

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
exactly right

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.670 
exactly right
so<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:53.460> betting<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.690> connector<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
so I'm betting a this connector here is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.689 
so I'm betting a this connector here is
a<00:00:56.210> pretty<00:00:57.260> toasty<00:00:58.260> I'm<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> best

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a pretty toasty I'm going to do the best

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.959 
a pretty toasty I'm going to do the best
I<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.910> at<00:01:00.390> cleaning<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.730> probably

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I can at cleaning it I think probably

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
I can at cleaning it I think probably
what<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> best<00:01:04.320> idea<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.970> would

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
what would be the best idea to do would

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.950 
what would be the best idea to do would
be<00:01:06.619> probably<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> replace<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.960> pigtail

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
be probably just to replace this pigtail

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.770 
be probably just to replace this pigtail
here<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
here I'm going to do to kind of get in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
here I'm going to do to kind of get in
there<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> clean<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.909> it's<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> take

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
there and clean all this it's to take

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.160 
there and clean all this it's to take
some<00:01:15.540> pop<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
some pop and in this can and then

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.160 
some pop and in this can and then
mechanically<00:01:19.860> clean<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
mechanically clean it with this like a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
mechanically clean it with this like a
dental<00:01:22.170> pick<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> picked<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.009> these

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
dental pick that I picked up these

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.179 
dental pick that I picked up these
things<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.549> awesome<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.330> rings<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
things are awesome for a rings and

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
things are awesome for a rings and
several<00:01:26.189> other<00:01:26.340> projects<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.570> you'll<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
several other projects that you'll be

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.219 
several other projects that you'll be
working<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.560> working<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.990> pretty

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
working or working in that can be pretty

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.060 
working or working in that can be pretty
tight<00:01:31.970> put<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.119> pop<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.380> let

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
tight put a little pop in this here let

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
tight put a little pop in this here let
it<00:01:35.100> soak<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.180> scrape<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.780> some<00:01:37.170> and

it soak kind of scrape it out some and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460 
it soak kind of scrape it out some and
clean<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.460> off<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> best<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
clean it off the best I can and see if I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.290 
clean it off the best I can and see if I
can't<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> least<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.909> decent<00:01:42.600> connection

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.540 

so<00:01:48.340> we'll<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.490> how<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.670> does<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:50.360> problem

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.300 
yeah a second ago you could hear that
thing<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:59.050> see<00:02:00.050> yeah<00:02:00.290> let<00:02:01.010> me<00:02:01.040> get

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.640 

yeah<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:19.629> kind<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.020> cleaning<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.470> up<00:02:20.590> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
yeah it's kind of cleaning it up a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.640 
yeah it's kind of cleaning it up a
little<00:02:20.800> bit<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.819> I'll<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.870> able<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.019> stick<00:02:26.470> it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
little bit and I'll be able to stick it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.059 
little bit and I'll be able to stick it
in<00:02:26.800> there<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:28.470> guess<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.590> better<00:02:29.739> take<00:02:30.040> this

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
in there I guess I better take this

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.360 
in there I guess I better take this
other<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:32.010> join<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
other one off here and join for the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:45.970 
other one off here and join for the
whole<00:02:33.580> thing<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:33.910> there

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.210 

I've<00:02:46.459> got<00:02:46.670> pop<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.569> help<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:48.410> there's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
I've got pop in it to help but there's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.600 
I've got pop in it to help but there's
also<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.970> corrosion<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:54.489> obviously<00:02:55.489> he

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
also like corrosion that obviously he

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.120 
also like corrosion that obviously he
want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> do<00:02:56.209> this<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.569> your<00:02:56.720> car<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.140> key<00:02:57.920> off

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
want to do this with your car on key off

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.960 
want to do this with your car on key off
yes<00:02:59.680> that's<00:03:00.680> heating<00:03:00.920> up<00:03:01.040> saw<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.400> corrosion

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
yes that's heating up saw that corrosion

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.670 
yes that's heating up saw that corrosion
on<00:03:02.090> there<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.600> mean<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> little<00:03:03.200> bit

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
on there I mean a little bit

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.770 
on there I mean a little bit
anything<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.459> be<00:03:04.520> perfect<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.239> think<00:03:05.660> I'm

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
anything can be perfect I think I'm

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.280 
anything can be perfect I think I'm
still<00:03:06.350> going<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.530> need<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.739> new<00:03:07.100> connector<00:03:07.790> and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
still going to need a new connector and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.800 
still going to need a new connector and
wire<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.770> but<00:03:10.370> maybe<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.300> get<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.630> with

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
wire that in but maybe I can get it with

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.550 
wire that in but maybe I can get it with
just<00:03:12.050> some<00:03:12.290> scraping<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:20.200> actually<00:03:21.200> got<00:03:21.530> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
just some scraping I actually got a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.830 
just some scraping I actually got a
thing<00:03:21.830> slide<00:03:22.130> there<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.030> Pens<00:03:23.300> itself

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
thing slide there the Pens itself

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.479 
thing slide there the Pens itself
themselves<00:03:24.470> don't<00:03:24.650> look<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:24.920> bad<00:03:25.160> looks

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
themselves don't look that bad looks

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.900 
themselves don't look that bad looks
like<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.620> connector<00:03:27.620> back<00:03:27.799> here<00:03:28.040> so

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
like it's just a connector back here so

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
like it's just a connector back here so
maybe<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:29.840> air<00:03:30.170> will<00:03:30.799> help<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:33.160> fix<00:03:34.160> your

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
maybe this air will help you fix your

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.870 
maybe this air will help you fix your
problem<00:03:36.260> let's<00:03:36.709> try<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.580> cleaned<00:03:37.790> up

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
problem let's try and get it cleaned up

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.640 
problem let's try and get it cleaned up
and<00:03:38.030> hook<00:03:38.360> up<00:03:38.510> hook<00:03:38.750> back<00:03:38.989> up<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.319> clear<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
and hook up hook back up and clear the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.330 
and hook up hook back up and clear the
code<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:39.980> see<00:03:40.160> how<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.370> does<00:03:40.519> then<00:03:42.130> alright

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
code and see how it does then alright

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.729 
code and see how it does then alright
I<00:03:43.370> cleaned<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.880> out<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.000> little<00:03:44.239> bit<00:03:44.739> this

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
I cleaned it out a little bit this

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.000 
I cleaned it out a little bit this
connector<00:03:46.280> here<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:48.200> mean<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.620> not<00:03:48.769> perfect

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
connector here I mean it's not perfect

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.069 
connector here I mean it's not perfect
as<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.730> see<00:03:50.000> there's<00:03:50.329> still<00:03:50.660> some<00:03:50.840> black

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
as you can see there's still some black

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.720 
as you can see there's still some black
on<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.680> try<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.859> get<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.310> mirror

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
on it and try to get it to a mirror

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.030 
on it and try to get it to a mirror
shine<00:03:52.930> that's<00:03:53.930> one<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.290> get<00:03:54.470> as<00:03:54.590> much<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.890> that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
shine that's one to get as much of that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.030 
shine that's one to get as much of that
gunk<00:03:55.430> off<00:03:55.670> as<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.000> possibly<00:03:56.420> could<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.049> it's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
gunk off as I possibly could and it's

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.849 
gunk off as I possibly could and it's
better<00:03:58.280> um<00:03:59.060> I'm<00:03:59.930> gonna<00:04:00.049> plug<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.500> here<00:04:00.709> and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
better um I'm gonna plug it in here and

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.670 
better um I'm gonna plug it in here and
see<00:04:01.640> how<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.910> does<00:04:02.120> if<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.570> give<00:04:02.720> any<00:04:02.870> very

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
see how it does if I give any very

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.280 
see how it does if I give any very
results<00:04:04.220> then<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.600> area<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.930> check

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
results then this is one area to check
