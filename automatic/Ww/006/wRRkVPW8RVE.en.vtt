like<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.170> mean<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:38.460> seen<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> hot

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like I mean I've seen a lot of hot

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.219 
like I mean I've seen a lot of hot
batteries<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.890> time<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.700> earth<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
batteries in my time on this earth and I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.440 
batteries in my time on this earth and I
like<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.950> mean<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.280> looks<00:01:44.490> cool<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.240> power

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
like I mean this looks cool the power

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
like I mean this looks cool the power
wall<00:01:45.780> looks<00:01:46.020> cool<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:47.700> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
wall looks cool but it also kind of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420 
wall looks cool but it also kind of
looks<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.030> phantom<00:01:48.810> toilet<00:01:49.590> seat<00:01:49.860> lid<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
looks like a phantom toilet seat lid I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.399 
looks like a phantom toilet seat lid I
mean<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.450> sorry<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.930> mean<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.380> really

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
mean I'm so I'm sorry I mean you really

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
mean I'm so I'm sorry I mean you really
can't<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.070> battery<00:01:53.399> packs<00:01:53.670> look<00:01:53.909> gorgeous

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
can't make battery packs look gorgeous

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
can't make battery packs look gorgeous
so<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.450> did<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.020> job<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.729> what

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so they did a pretty good job with what

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399 
so they did a pretty good job with what
they<00:01:56.880> had<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.420> also<00:01:57.509> comes<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.899> other<00:01:58.079> colors

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
they had but also comes in other colors

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
they had but also comes in other colors
like<00:01:58.590> red<00:01:58.829> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> red<00:01:59.490> white<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.759> black

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
like red kind of the red white and black

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
like red kind of the red white and black
and<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> black<00:02:01.680> looks<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> some

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and actually the black looks like some

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
and actually the black looks like some
kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.670> insignia<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:04.439> Batman<00:02:05.189> or

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
kind of insignia for like Batman or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.460 
kind of insignia for like Batman or
something<00:02:05.939> so

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
something so

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.990 
something so
I<00:02:06.710> mean<00:02:07.040> that's<00:02:07.160> kind<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.370> cool<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.700> don't<00:02:07.940> know

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
I mean that's kind of cool I don't know

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.510 
I mean that's kind of cool I don't know
but<00:02:08.210> what<00:02:08.630> they<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:09.050> basically<00:02:09.740> store

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
but what they do is basically store

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.080 
but what they do is basically store
energy<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.990> your<00:02:12.620> home<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.100> power<00:02:13.430> wall

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
energy on your home so the power wall

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.150 
energy on your home so the power wall
which<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> what<00:02:14.810> would<00:02:14.960> be<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.380> your<00:02:15.530> home<00:02:15.800> is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
which is what would be for your home is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.310 
which is what would be for your home is
this<00:02:16.730> thing<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.330> goes<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.910> wall<00:02:20.320> it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
this thing that goes on the wall it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.080 
this thing that goes on the wall it
hangs<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.710> your<00:02:21.740> wall<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.400> three<00:02:22.880> feet

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
hangs on your wall it's like three feet

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.160 
hangs on your wall it's like three feet
by<00:02:23.270> four<00:02:23.540> feet<00:02:23.570> six<00:02:24.080> inches<00:02:24.170> deep<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.970> it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
by four feet six inches deep and it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
by four feet six inches deep and it
stores<00:02:27.170> energy<00:02:27.440> from<00:02:28.160> hopefully<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.610> mean<00:02:28.760> Elon

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
stores energy from hopefully I mean Elon

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.940 
stores energy from hopefully I mean Elon
Elon<00:02:29.390> Musk<00:02:30.080> hopes<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> you're<00:02:30.650> storing

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
Elon Musk hopes that you're storing

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.350 
Elon Musk hopes that you're storing
energy<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.490> capture<00:02:31.850> from<00:02:32.000> your<00:02:32.060> solar

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
energy that you capture from your solar

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.720 
energy that you capture from your solar
panels<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:32.870> are<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.080> your<00:02:33.170> roof<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.730> then

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
panels which are on your roof and then

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.640 
panels which are on your roof and then
it<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.600> use<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.900> later<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
it can you can use it later on so it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
it can you can use it later on so it
serves<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.070> lot<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.030> has<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> lot<00:02:38.390> of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
serves a lot of this it has a lot of

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.160 
serves a lot of this it has a lot of
benefits<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.020> number<00:02:39.650> one<00:02:39.880> mmm<00:02:41.050> it'll<00:02:42.050> work

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
benefits so number one mmm it'll work

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.630 
benefits so number one mmm it'll work
even<00:02:42.530> if<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.709> don't<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:42.950> solar<00:02:43.160> panels<00:02:43.220> so

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
even if you don't have solar panels so

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.190 
even if you don't have solar panels so
it<00:02:43.760> will<00:02:43.850> store<00:02:44.120> energy<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.840> store<00:02:45.020> energy

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
it will store energy it can store energy

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.120 
it will store energy it can store energy
from<00:02:45.680> because<00:02:45.860> energy<00:02:46.420> energy<00:02:47.420> costs<00:02:48.230> spike

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
from because energy energy costs spike

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.220 
from because energy energy costs spike
and<00:02:49.370> drop<00:02:49.790> during<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> day<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.330> energy<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.870> way

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and drop during the day so energy is way

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.040 
and drop during the day so energy is way
cheaper<00:02:51.860> at<00:02:52.100> nights<00:02:52.550> little<00:02:53.000> store<00:02:53.720> all<00:02:53.900> this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
cheaper at nights little store all this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.600 
cheaper at nights little store all this
energy<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:54.860> like<00:02:54.950> 10<00:02:55.160> kilowatt

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
energy for you it's like 10 kilowatt

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.790 
energy for you it's like 10 kilowatt
hours<00:02:55.910> it'll<00:02:56.840> store<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.290> energy<00:02:57.470> for

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
hours it'll store all that energy for

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.020 
hours it'll store all that energy for
you<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.100> then<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.580> use<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.910> energy

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
you and then you can use that energy

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.130 
you and then you can use that energy
during<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.420> day<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.630> you're<00:02:59.900> actually<00:02:59.990> using

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
during the day so you're actually using

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.400 
during the day so you're actually using
cheaper<00:03:00.800> energy<00:03:01.040> during<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:02.030> day<00:03:02.330> which<00:03:03.260> is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
cheaper energy during the day which is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.710 
cheaper energy during the day which is
kind<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.680> cool<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.310> also<00:03:05.240> with<00:03:05.510> all<00:03:05.600> that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
kind of cool and also with all that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.270 
kind of cool and also with all that
stored<00:03:05.990> energy<00:03:06.170> if<00:03:06.590> your<00:03:06.709> power<00:03:06.890> ever<00:03:07.190> goes

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
stored energy if your power ever goes

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.630 
stored energy if your power ever goes
out<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:08.630> can<00:03:08.990> just<00:03:09.320> use<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.130> power<00:03:10.340> from<00:03:10.489> your

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
out you can just use the power from your

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.770 
out you can just use the power from your
power<00:03:10.820> pack<00:03:11.060> or<00:03:11.420> your<00:03:12.140> power<00:03:12.800> wall<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
power pack or your power wall and you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.140 
power pack or your power wall and you
have<00:03:14.870> energy<00:03:14.989> for<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.250> while<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.000> that's

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
have energy for a little while so that's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210 
have energy for a little while so that's
really<00:03:17.239> cool<00:03:17.620> for<00:03:18.620> certain<00:03:18.800> countries<00:03:19.130> like

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
really cool for certain countries like

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.590 
really cool for certain countries like
Germany<00:03:19.610> which<00:03:19.790> are<00:03:19.910> really<00:03:20.060> solar<00:03:20.360> power

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
Germany which are really solar power

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.910 
Germany which are really solar power
Alliance<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.380> be<00:03:21.440> better<00:03:21.739> because

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
Alliance going to be better because

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.560 
Alliance going to be better because
these<00:03:22.070> people<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.640> lot<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.239> people<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.480> Germany

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
these people a lot of people in Germany

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.840 
these people a lot of people in Germany
have<00:03:23.780> solar<00:03:23.989> power<00:03:24.350> apparently<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.220> they

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
have solar power apparently and they

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
have solar power apparently and they
will<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.030> able<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.300> sell<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.780> back<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
will be able to sell it back to the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.150 
will be able to sell it back to the
utilities<00:03:29.870> there<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.320> actually<00:03:30.590> make<00:03:30.950> some

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
utilities there and actually make some

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.380 
utilities there and actually make some
money<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.610> there's<00:03:31.760> all<00:03:31.970> there's<00:03:32.150> all<00:03:32.269> these

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
money so there's all there's all these

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.390 
money so there's all there's all these
cool<00:03:32.600> things<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.140> most<00:03:33.380> importantly<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
cool things but most importantly is it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.840 
cool things but most importantly is it
makes<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.820> more<00:03:35.380> green<00:03:36.380> if<00:03:36.799> you<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.280> solar

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
makes you more green if you have solar

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.000 
makes you more green if you have solar
panels<00:03:37.940> on<00:03:38.690> your<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:39.140> your<00:03:39.200> house<00:03:39.530> because

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
panels on your on your house because

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.100 
panels on your on your house because
then<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:40.940> be<00:03:41.030> storing<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.510> energy<00:03:41.900> I

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
then you can be storing this energy I

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.539 
then you can be storing this energy I
mean<00:03:42.470> he<00:03:42.530> was<00:03:42.650> saying<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.920> big<00:03:43.070> problem<00:03:43.430> is

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
mean he was saying the big problem is

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.310 
mean he was saying the big problem is
with<00:03:43.730> solar<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.330> at<00:03:44.450> night<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.959> sun's<00:03:45.170> on

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
with solar is that at night the sun's on

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.620 
with solar is that at night the sun's on
out<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.500> mean<00:03:45.769> all<00:03:45.950> beers<00:03:46.310> blue<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.150> now<00:03:47.450> with

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
out I mean all beers blue so now with

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.820 
out I mean all beers blue so now with
this<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:47.989> store<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> energy<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.650> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
this you can store the energy that you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.350 
this you can store the energy that you
capture<00:03:49.130> doing<00:03:49.340> today<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.549> use<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:49.940> bah<00:03:50.150> blah

out I didn't even know it existed but
great<00:04:06.799> price<00:04:06.980> apparently<00:04:07.870> as<00:04:08.870> more<00:04:09.140> people

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
great price apparently as more people

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.810 
great price apparently as more people
get<00:04:09.500> them<00:04:09.650> they'll<00:04:09.860> be<00:04:09.980> able<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.549> take

get them they'll be able to like take

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.250 
get them they'll be able to like take
the<00:04:10.880> strain<00:04:11.209> off<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.480> grid<00:04:11.660> at<00:04:11.780> certain<00:04:12.049> times

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
the strain off the grid at certain times

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.559 
the strain off the grid at certain times
and<00:04:12.590> talk<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.890> each<00:04:12.980> other<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.400> get<00:04:14.090> smarter

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
and what's really cool what I really

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.400 
and what's really cool what I really
like<00:04:16.580> that<00:04:16.609> he<00:04:16.760> showed<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.330> he<00:04:17.780> was<00:04:17.989> like<00:04:18.169> how

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
like that he showed is he was like how

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.470 
like that he showed is he was like how
much<00:04:18.739> of

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
much of

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.290 
much of
this<00:04:19.600> looks<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.260> square<00:04:20.740> land<00:04:21.100> square<00:04:21.700> mile

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
this looks like square land square mile

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.110 
this looks like square land square mile
land<00:04:22.720> I'm<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.920> mathematician<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.670> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
land I'm not a mathematician and the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.970 
land I'm not a mathematician and the
United<00:04:25.360> States<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:25.810> need<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.470> go<00:04:26.680> completely

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
United States we need to go completely

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.220 
United States we need to go completely
solar<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.880> completely<00:04:28.180> battery<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.050> put

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
solar and completely battery and you put

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.840 
solar and completely battery and you put
a<00:04:29.260> picture<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.040> United<00:04:30.370> States<00:04:30.400> up<00:04:30.670> there

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
a picture of the United States up there

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.980 
a picture of the United States up there
and<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.060> can<00:04:31.210> see<00:04:31.330> was<00:04:31.450> like<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:31.690> this

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
and you can see was like this this

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.950 
and you can see was like this this
little<00:04:32.350> square<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.730> not<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.210> big<00:04:34.780> I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
little square and it's not that big I

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.750 
little square and it's not that big I
mean<00:04:35.110> it's<00:04:35.200> big<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.830> huge<00:04:36.190> when<00:04:36.640> you're

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
mean it's big it's huge when you're

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.010 
mean it's big it's huge when you're
because<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.270> whole<00:04:37.480> map<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.780> United

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
because it's a whole map the United

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.240 
because it's a whole map the United
States<00:04:38.170> but<00:04:38.410> not<00:04:38.680> what<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.860> would<00:04:39.070> be

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
States but not what you would be

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.100 
States but not what you would be
expecting<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:40.000> then<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.420> showed<00:04:40.630> us<00:04:40.750> exactly

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
expecting and then you showed us exactly

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.540 
expecting and then you showed us exactly
how<00:04:41.350> much<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.800> square<00:04:42.100> would<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.280> taken

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
how much of that square would be taken

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.850 
how much of that square would be taken
up<00:04:42.640> by<00:04:42.670> batteries<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:44.050> create<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.620> whole

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
up by batteries to create this whole

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.500 
up by batteries to create this whole
like<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.220> would<00:04:45.310> be<00:04:45.340> all<00:04:45.580> solar<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.270> United

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
like it would be all solar in the United

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.210 
like it would be all solar in the United
States<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.260> was<00:04:47.380> like<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.620> little<00:04:47.860> pixels

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
States and it was like the little pixels

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.310 
States and it was like the little pixels
like<00:04:48.340> one<00:04:48.520> pixel<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.180> that's<00:04:49.870> really<00:04:50.140> cool

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
like one pixel so that's really cool

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.740 
like one pixel so that's really cool
they<00:04:50.560> can<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:50.860> people<00:04:51.190> adopt<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.630> can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
they can if people adopt this and we can

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.970 
they can if people adopt this and we can
get<00:04:52.870> people<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:54.090> buy<00:04:55.090> them<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.560> prices

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
get people to buy them and the prices

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.930 
get people to buy them and the prices
come<00:04:57.160> down<00:04:57.190> they're<00:04:57.520> gonna<00:04:57.640> start<00:04:57.820> making

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
come down they're gonna start making

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.090 
come down they're gonna start making
these<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:58.360> their<00:04:58.540> gigafactory<00:04:59.230> in<00:04:59.740> nevada

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
these in their gigafactory in nevada

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.030 
these in their gigafactory in nevada
after<00:05:00.520> that's<00:05:00.670> done<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:02.500> gonna<00:05:02.650> be<00:05:02.890> really

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
after that's done it's gonna be really

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.260 
after that's done it's gonna be really
cool<00:05:03.280> they're<00:05:03.460> also<00:05:03.610> offering<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.090> power

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
cool they're also offering the power

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.850 
cool they're also offering the power
pack<00:05:04.540> which<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.840> like<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.140> same<00:05:05.500> thing<00:05:05.740> but

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
pack which is like the same thing but

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.530 
pack which is like the same thing but
for<00:05:06.040> businesses<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.670> obviously<00:05:06.970> holds<00:05:07.480> a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
for businesses so it obviously holds a

for businesses so it obviously holds a
lot<00:05:07.660> more<00:05:07.840> energy<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.970> anyways<00:05:09.970> that's<00:05:10.150> what

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
lot more energy so anyways that's what

pushing stuff like this forward I mean

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.190 
pushing stuff like this forward I mean
there<00:05:33.730> are<00:05:33.820> still<00:05:34.060> certain<00:05:34.360> downsize<00:05:34.990> you're

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
there are still certain downsize you're

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.630 
there are still certain downsize you're
making<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.740> lot<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.890> batteries<00:05:36.280> which<00:05:36.400> use<00:05:36.580> a

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
making a lot of batteries which use a

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.370 
making a lot of batteries which use a
lot<00:05:36.790> of<00:05:36.820> rare<00:05:37.300> earth<00:05:37.420> materials<00:05:37.540> but<00:05:37.990> we<00:05:38.290> have

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
lot of rare earth materials but we have

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.900 
lot of rare earth materials but we have
to<00:05:38.470> keep<00:05:38.620> moving<00:05:38.770> forward<00:05:39.070> we<00:05:39.400> have<00:05:39.490> just<00:05:39.700> find

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
to keep moving forward we have just find

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.030 
to keep moving forward we have just find
solutions<00:05:40.420> we<00:05:40.510> can't<00:05:40.690> just<00:05:40.870> say<00:05:41.050> oh<00:05:41.290> this<00:05:41.920> is

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
solutions we can't just say oh this is

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.470 
solutions we can't just say oh this is
where<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:42.280> should<00:05:42.460> be<00:05:42.790> because<00:05:43.090> there's

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
where we should be because there's

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.610 
where we should be because there's
nothing<00:05:43.630> better<00:05:43.960> we<00:05:44.230> have<00:05:44.320> to<00:05:44.410> go<00:05:44.500> out<00:05:44.560> and

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
nothing better we have to go out and

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620 
nothing better we have to go out and
find<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:45.190> luckily<00:05:45.640> it<00:05:46.330> looks<00:05:46.360> like

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
find it and luckily it looks like

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.330 
find it and luckily it looks like
Tesla's<00:05:46.960> pushing<00:05:47.260> us<00:05:47.350> even<00:05:47.620> farther<00:05:47.860> forward

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
Tesla's pushing us even farther forward

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.520 
Tesla's pushing us even farther forward
