00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.790
 the career brand has always been 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 particularly strong is the passage of the 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.390
 brand in the hands of dave cox and mercury 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.880
 steam had raised some 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.500
 doubts doubt however cast out in 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.090
 away with the arrival on the consoles 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.759
 old generation housewives of 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.509
 lords of shadow a pure action of those 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.520
 with a difficulty 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.740
 certainly above average and one 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.020
 extraordinary longevity if you have played 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.300
 at the first career lords of shadows ci 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.920
 we immediately reassure you what you have seen 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600
 in these first few hours of his sequel 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.610
 does not deviate markedly to the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.890
 old title and this is very clear is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.690
 absolutely good in the guise of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.579
 gaber belmont we found ourselves playing 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.410
 a sort of tutorial thanks to which 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.000
 we took human with the mechanisms 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.129
 of a definitely valid gameplay 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.289
 gabriel had the main powers 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.030
 completely unlocked and all weapons 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.320
 they were imbued with dark magic 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.879
 layout 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 so it took only an instant for 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.930
 re-enter the atmosphere completely 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.490
 career vampire and not just one 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.110
 small group of knights has broken through 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.460
 the doors of our castle 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.380
 we were ready with ours 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.520
 sword and our whip to do a 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.830
 shreds the assailants 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.689
 the fluidity of the combat system has remained 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.460
 unchanged from the past and the 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.259
 ability to change weapons quickly 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 and quickly and again the point of 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.340
 strength of gabrail game mechanics 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.649
 can easily execute combos quickly 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 land aircraft to give howe to target 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.100
 single simply alternating his 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.140
 fast attacks on heavy ones 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 interposing there by directional blows 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.939
 essential jumps and dodges for not 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.439
 take damage as always the klose charts 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.270
 and the deaf void must be 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.219
 used with wisdom and intelligence 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.079
 since the enemies will attack in 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.729
 large groups of communities equipped with 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.380
 well diversified skills among them that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.719
 will require precise strategies for 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.399
 to be defeated so forget about 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.350
 twirl the blade with barbara 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.119
 unconsciousness every stroke must be 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.259
 thought to have and every opponent will have to 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.030
 be fought with the right one 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.009
 combination of moves and especially with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.299
 the right useless equipment a 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.310
 head-up an armed soldier 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.930
 of shield for example we must first 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.430
 pieces equal defenses only once 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.770
 unarmed we could hit him and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.270
 slaughter him without mercy in this way 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.580
 the clashes always turn out to be 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.200
 particularly dynamic and diverse 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.090
 they are even more structured 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.379
 curate 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.300
 we have seen in the past for a 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.640
 overall result really really 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.769
 great henchmen who throw themselves at it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 against are just the appetizer for the real 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.220
 challenges those two head-to-head against the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.930
 end-of-level bosses that will make us 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.730
 sweat seven shirts 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.110
 during these fights besides the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.299
 brute force we should rely 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.799
 also to the brain with fights that 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.360
 increasingly require use 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.580
 of gray matter to be able to be 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.590
 overcome the enemy attacks follow 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.120
 precise patterns and scripts the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.799
 player must from time to time to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 find the right reading key for 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.010
 avoid the most devastating attacks e 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.170
 respond in the short window of time 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.549
 open after having stunned the opponent 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.220
 I made one of his people go blank 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.170
 assaults expect long struggles 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.060
 and difficult against some minimum c 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.489
 larger and more imposing than the headquarters i 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.810
 remember after the initial phase there 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.819
 sees fully armed 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.829
 gabriel will be stripped of all his 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.049
 powers reported by a weak state and 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.849
 powerless and slowly he will have to rebuild 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.220
 its now lost that the air before 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.590
 we will find ourselves in the final showdown 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.959
 to wander for two different ages a future 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.209
 very dark and a past to us too 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.130
 familiar with continuous flashbacks there 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.380
 will bring back and forth over time 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.420
 for an alternation of situations 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.859
 enjoyable during the preview event 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.230
 we chatted 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.910
 with dave cox and explained that that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.420
 to browse belmonte again gods 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.670
 his powers 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.709
 it was an almost physiological necessity 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.239
 a choice due to the clear will of 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.859
 give the player a new sense of 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.420
 character growth progression 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.609
 which otherwise would have been 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.260
 virtually impossible to get by 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.329
 what I saw the task was successful 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.790
 excellently and the huge amount of 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.139
 skill secret weapons and comfortable unlock 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.450
 it is not second to any other game 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.950
 belonging to this genus 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.049
 we have several branches in which 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.269
 develop gabriel based skills 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.310
 obviously on pure magic or on weapons 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.480
 at his disposal and every single skill 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.880
 it can be made to grow 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 further level offering thus 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.730
 even more depth 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.110
 career lords of shadow ndue does not put 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.670
 on the plan of course only the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.019
 fighting but concentrating is 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.970
 normally also on the phases of 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 exploration in this case the rules 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.810
 world at our disposal is divided 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.250
 in roughly linear levels put the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.630
 given the opportunity to return to 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.550
 our steps at different times 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 taking advantage of new truth to reach 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.509
 otherwise inaccessible places and open to 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.580
 example is able to turn into 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.020
 fog to pass through the grates or 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.449
 to get carried away by the currents 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.610
 air the level design seemed to us 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.050
 succeeded and the settings roughly 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 both those of the old castle of 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.340
 dracula that the new locations are there 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.289
 it seemed to be a good one except for the usual ones 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.400
 scientific laboratories that they knew 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.919
 really already seen 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.690
 excellent the graphic component perhaps with 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.060
 a too marked bloom on the characters 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.440
 with well-characterized oscar enemies 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.740
 cat and ski and attention to detail 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.669
 which left us pleasantly impressed 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.229
 evaluate in all respects the appearance 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.880
 technician of an old gen game 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.800
 after spending the last few months with the 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.410
 head under a cascade of nexen titles 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.759
 it is particularly complex but in 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.710
 general line we can consider ourselves 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.870
 satisfied with the work done by mercury 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.410
 steam and we're sure this chapter 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.479
 the final 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.479
 he will be able to finish the saga with dignity
