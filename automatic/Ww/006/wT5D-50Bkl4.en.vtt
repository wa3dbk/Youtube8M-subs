I'm going to drive pretty much the same
way<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.580> did<00:00:41.730> last<00:00:41.970> time

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.830 

quick<00:00:46.840> but<00:00:47.080> cautiously<00:00:48.240> for<00:00:49.240> all<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.450> guys<00:00:49.600> in

quick but cautiously for all you guys in

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.460 
quick but cautiously for all you guys in
the<00:00:49.930> US<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.560> watch<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.460> last<00:00:51.640> video<00:00:51.880> and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
the US that watch the last video and

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.570 
the US that watch the last video and
freaked<00:00:53.470> out<00:00:53.680> that<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:53.980> was<00:00:54.070> on<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.220> wrong<00:00:54.340> side

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
freaked out that I was on the wrong side

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.180 
freaked out that I was on the wrong side
of<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.760> road<00:00:54.880> don't<00:00:55.150> worry<00:00:55.390> i'm<00:00:55.540> in<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.720> UK<00:00:56.190> we

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
of the road don't worry i'm in the UK we

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.770 
of the road don't worry i'm in the UK we
drive<00:00:57.460> on<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.970> left<00:00:58.000> hand<00:00:58.390> side<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.840> road

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.980 

which<00:01:03.320> obviously<00:01:03.500> makes<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.949> difference

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.249 

because<00:01:07.439> when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.060> come<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.210> towards<00:01:09.600> another

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
because when you come on towards another

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.460 
because when you come on towards another
car<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:12.420> expecting<00:01:12.899> to<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
car and you're expecting to be on the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
car and you're expecting to be on the
other<00:01:13.590> side<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.009> road<00:01:14.299> I'm<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:17.000> think

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
other side of the road I'm not I think

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
other side of the road I'm not I think
it's<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.330> blend<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.470> came

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's on this blend actually that we came

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's on this blend actually that we came
across<00:01:19.830> another<00:01:20.100> car<00:01:20.549> last<00:01:20.789> time

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460

cyclist here or something and car on
this<00:01:29.049> bendable<00:01:29.590> strangely<00:01:30.190> enough<00:01:30.310> there's

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
this bendable strangely enough there's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.610 
this bendable strangely enough there's
another<00:01:30.670> car<00:01:30.880> on<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.119> end

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.490 
the bypass is a lot of the traffic but
it<00:04:14.400> isn't<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.620> nicest<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.669> roads<00:04:18.410> when<00:04:19.410> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it isn't in the nicest of roads when you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.040 
it isn't in the nicest of roads when you
come<00:04:19.680> across<00:04:19.859> someone

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.260 

okay<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.979> wasn't<00:04:25.099> exactly<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.879> same<00:04:26.090> as

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
okay so it wasn't exactly the same as

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.490 
okay so it wasn't exactly the same as
last<00:04:26.300> time<00:04:26.629> and<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:29.840> was<00:04:29.960> obviously<00:04:30.229> i<00:04:30.289> came

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
last time and it was obviously i came

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.629 
last time and it was obviously i came
across<00:04:30.590> a<00:04:30.740> couple<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.069> different<00:04:31.310> cards<00:04:31.550> at

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
across a couple of different cards at

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.450 
across a couple of different cards at
different<00:04:31.879> points<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.050> same<00:04:33.199> road

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
different points it's the same road

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:43.570 
different points it's the same road
traveled<00:04:34.460> about<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.879> same<00:04:35.090> speeds
