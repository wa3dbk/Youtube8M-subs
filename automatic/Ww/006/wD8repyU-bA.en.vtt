00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
important things in making the sonatina

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.439 
important things in making the sonatina
interesting<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:03.890> having<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.369> lot<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.549> contrasts

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
interesting is having a lot of contrasts

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.740 
interesting is having a lot of contrasts
both<00:01:05.659> dynamic<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.430> articulation<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:07.880> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
both dynamic and articulation in the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.630 
both dynamic and articulation in the
first<00:01:08.990> measure<00:01:09.229> we<00:01:09.470> have<00:01:09.500> Forte<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.490> have

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
first measure we have Forte and we have

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.340 
first measure we have Forte and we have
piano<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:11.750> can<00:01:11.869> think<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.140> different

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
piano so you can think of different

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.050 
piano so you can think of different
instruments<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:13.100> an<00:01:13.190> orchestra<00:01:13.220> playing<00:01:13.909> the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
instruments in an orchestra playing the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.050 
instruments in an orchestra playing the
different<00:01:14.450> parts<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.170> have<00:01:15.770> more<00:01:16.069> contrast<00:01:16.460> so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
different parts to have more contrast so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.580 
different parts to have more contrast so
you<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:17.270> think<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.840> first<00:01:18.080> part<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
you can think of the first part the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.660 
you can think of the first part the
Forte<00:01:18.979> as<00:01:19.190> maybe<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> brass<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:22.340> then<00:01:22.580> this

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
Forte as maybe the brass and then this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.020 
Forte as maybe the brass and then this
Truths<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.240> answer<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:28.490> hand<00:01:28.729> rhythm

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
Truths can answer the right hand rhythm

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.609 
Truths can answer the right hand rhythm
and<00:01:29.210> slurs<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.780> measures<00:01:30.050> five<00:01:30.350> through

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
and slurs and measures five through

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.889 
and slurs and measures five through
eight<00:01:30.649> can<00:01:31.100> catch<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.399> by<00:01:31.520> surprise<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.240> make

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
eight can catch you by surprise so make

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.050 
eight can catch you by surprise so make
sure<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.770> know<00:01:33.979> what<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.700> goes<00:01:34.819> together

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
sure that you know what it goes together

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.539 
sure that you know what it goes together
and<00:01:35.509> when<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.200> comes<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.100> want<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> have

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
and when it comes and you want to have

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:48.490 
and when it comes and you want to have
nice<00:01:37.759> phrasing<00:01:38.360> through<00:01:38.569> that

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.080 

the<00:01:49.500> left<00:01:49.710> hand<00:01:49.950> Alberti<00:01:50.280> base<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.760> those<00:01:50.880> same

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the left hand Alberti base in those same

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.600 
the left hand Alberti base in those same
measures<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.720> also<00:01:51.900> be<00:01:52.170> tricky<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.159> dynamic

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
measures can also be tricky the dynamic

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.550 
measures can also be tricky the dynamic
marking<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.119> mezzo<00:01:54.450> Forte<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> think

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
marking is mezzo Forte but if you think

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
marking is mezzo Forte but if you think
about<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.130> piano<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.299> it'll<00:01:57.509> probably

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
about it as piano then it'll probably

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410 
about it as piano then it'll probably
come<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.770> balance<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.520> you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
come out of the right balance and you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
come out of the right balance and you
also<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:01.409> you're<00:02:01.530> practicing<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> can

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
also when you're practicing it you can

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
also when you're practicing it you can
try<00:02:02.580> blocking<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.330> in<00:02:03.509> groups<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> four<00:02:04.259> notes

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
try blocking it in groups of four notes

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.870 
try blocking it in groups of four notes
and<00:02:04.800> that'll<00:02:05.159> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.610> where<00:02:05.759> your

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and that'll make it to where your

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.219 
and that'll make it to where your
fingers<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.630> they're<00:02:06.780> doing<00:02:07.050> more

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
fingers know what they're doing more

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:18.490 
fingers know what they're doing more
when<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> play<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.190> written<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.700> like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.900 

starting<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.620> measure<00:02:19.830> nine<00:02:20.160> it'll<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.760> like

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
starting in measure nine it'll be like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.270 
starting in measure nine it'll be like
the<00:02:21.030> beginning<00:02:21.180> again<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:23.010> want<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the beginning again but then we want to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
the beginning again but then we want to
keep<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> momentum<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:24.060> because<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.769> don't

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
keep the momentum going because we don't

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.970 
keep the momentum going because we don't
have<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.580> piano<00:02:27.060> after<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:28.230> goes<00:02:28.470> builds

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
have the piano after that it goes builds

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.330 
have the piano after that it goes builds
to<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.330> fortissimo<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.530> measure<00:02:31.769> eleven

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to a fortissimo and in measure eleven

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.100 
to a fortissimo and in measure eleven
when<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.940> high<00:02:33.120> a's<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:33.989> to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
when we have the high a's we want to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.160 
when we have the high a's we want to
head<00:02:34.319> towards<00:02:34.680> those<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.510> come<00:02:39.870> down<00:02:40.050> like

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
head towards those so and come down like

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.860 
head towards those so and come down like
that<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.680> ready<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> start<00:02:41.160> again<00:02:41.870> many

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that and get ready to start again many

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.630 
that and get ready to start again many
students<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> tendency<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.100> rush<00:02:44.430> this

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
students have a tendency to rush this

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 
students have a tendency to rush this
piece<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:45.959> sound<00:02:46.080> something<00:02:46.319> like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
piece and it would sound something like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.020 
piece and it would sound something like
this<00:02:51.829> but<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:52.890> doesn't<00:02:53.010> keep<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.579> majestic

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this but that doesn't keep the majestic

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.800 
this but that doesn't keep the majestic
character<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.570> much<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:55.110> something<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.590> this

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.090 

so<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.140> practicing<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.799> make<00:03:04.950> sure

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
so as you're practicing it make sure

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.860 
so as you're practicing it make sure
that<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.370> don't<00:03:05.760> catch<00:03:06.120> yourself<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.630> too

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that you don't catch yourself going too

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 
that you don't catch yourself going too
fast<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.440> maybe<00:03:07.920> use<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.280> metronome<00:03:08.579> every

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
fast and maybe use the metronome every

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.390 
fast and maybe use the metronome every
now<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.420> keep<00:03:09.540> yourself<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.019> check
