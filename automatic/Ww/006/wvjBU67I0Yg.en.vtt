00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
we're gonna do that just by searing the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800 
we're gonna do that just by searing the
edges<00:02:28.950> over<00:02:29.100> high<00:02:29.640> heat<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> little

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
edges over high heat it with a little

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750 
edges over high heat it with a little
butter<00:02:31.020> about<00:02:31.380> 30<00:02:31.890> seconds<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.400> time<00:02:32.550> we're

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
butter about 30 seconds of time we're

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.650 
butter about 30 seconds of time we're
just<00:02:32.940> adding<00:02:33.150> some<00:02:33.450> color<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:38.300> don't<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
just adding some color you don't have to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.760 
just adding some color you don't have to
do<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.320> cook<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> without

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
do this you can just cook it without

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.860 
do this you can just cook it without
this<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.390> cook<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.720> slow

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
this but when you cook it a slow

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.480 
this but when you cook it a slow
temperature<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.620> looks<00:02:44.070> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> gross

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
temperature it this looks kind of gross

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.550 
temperature it this looks kind of gross
and<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.480> want<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.660> add<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> color<00:02:46.230> like

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and so we want to add the color like

00:02:46.560 --> 00:03:00.369 
and so we want to add the color like
this<00:02:47.370> nice<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.180> brown<00:02:48.360> right<00:02:49.140> get<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.530> ends

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.750 

the<00:03:01.379> reason<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.769> do<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.129> we<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.610> cook

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the reason we do this is we want to cook

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.069 
the reason we do this is we want to cook
it<00:03:02.939> and<00:03:03.120> there's<00:03:03.269> lower<00:03:03.450> temperature<00:03:03.959> as

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
it and there's lower temperature as

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.530 
it and there's lower temperature as
possible<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.400> gives<00:03:05.909> us<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> much<00:03:06.209> time

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
possible so that gives us a much time

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.809 
possible so that gives us a much time
for<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.049> fat<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.560> melt<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.310> seep<00:03:08.549> into<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
for the fat to melt and to seep into the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.729 
for the fat to melt and to seep into the
meat<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.209> make<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.599> tender<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.560> this

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
meat and make it really tender so this

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.470 
meat and make it really tender so this
way<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.519> have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.790> try<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> cook<00:03:12.269> into

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
way we don't have to try to cook into

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
way we don't have to try to cook into
the<00:03:12.599> higher<00:03:12.780> temp<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.680> give<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:13.950> color<00:03:14.159> we've

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the higher temp to give it color we've

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.280 
the higher temp to give it color we've
already<00:03:14.549> given<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.150> color<00:03:15.390> by<00:03:15.930> doing<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
already given it color by doing the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.869 
already given it color by doing the
searing<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.579> with<00:03:17.760> your

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
searing then you can do this with your

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.580 
searing then you can do this with your
big<00:03:18.120> roast<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.599> recommend<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
big roast and I recommend it get a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.020 
big roast and I recommend it get a
little<00:03:19.650> bit<00:03:19.769> blood<00:03:20.040> Japan<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.579> sear<00:03:20.849> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
little bit blood Japan and sear the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.940 
little bit blood Japan and sear the
edges<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.780> cook<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:21.989> at<00:03:22.200> 325<00:03:22.379> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
edges and then just cook it at 325 the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
edges and then just cook it at 325 the
entire<00:03:23.220> time<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:27.060> thermometer<00:03:27.629> this<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.109> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
entire time be thermometer this is the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.720 
entire time be thermometer this is the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
on at the end when it's all done for now

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.790 
on at the end when it's all done for now
we're<00:04:13.510> gonna<00:04:13.600> take<00:04:13.840> our<00:04:13.990> steaks<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.530> put<00:04:14.710> them

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
we're gonna take our steaks and put them

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.190 
we're gonna take our steaks and put them
in<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.980> 325<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.000> cook<00:04:16.510> them<00:04:16.660> until<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:17.020> hits

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
in the 325 and cook them until it hits

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.620 
in the 325 and cook them until it hits
120<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.370> then<00:04:18.550> we'll<00:04:18.670> come<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.000> shoot<00:04:19.180> and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
120 and then we'll come and shoot and

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.570 
120 and then we'll come and shoot and
pull<00:04:19.780> them<00:04:19.900> out<00:04:19.989> but<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:21.010> only<00:04:21.190> gonna<00:04:21.489> take

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
pull them out but it's only gonna take

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.400 
pull them out but it's only gonna take
about<00:04:21.820> 20<00:04:22.270> minutes<00:04:22.300> because<00:04:22.720> these<00:04:22.990> roasts

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
about 20 minutes because these roasts

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.410 
about 20 minutes because these roasts
are<00:04:23.530> smaller<00:04:23.860> than<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> large<00:04:24.490> one<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:24.970> so

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
are smaller than the large one and so

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.420 
are smaller than the large one and so
it's<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.930> little<00:04:26.050> bit<00:04:26.230> easier<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.590> time<00:04:26.950> for<00:04:27.370> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
it's a little bit easier to time for a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.880 
it's a little bit easier to time for a
big<00:04:28.000> family<00:04:28.210> meal<00:04:28.540> make<00:04:29.170> sure<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.470> can<00:04:29.620> see

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
big family meal make sure you can see

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.150 
big family meal make sure you can see
the<00:04:30.070> meat<00:04:30.220> thermometer<00:04:30.340> when<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.030> put<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.360> in

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.159 

all<00:04:39.160> right<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.520> internal<00:04:39.970> temp<00:04:40.210> is<00:04:40.360> at<00:04:40.449> 120

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
all right the internal temp is at 120

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.260 
all right the internal temp is at 120
we're<00:04:41.590> gonna<00:04:41.710> pull<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.069> out<00:04:42.190> put<00:04:43.000> on<00:04:43.030> our
