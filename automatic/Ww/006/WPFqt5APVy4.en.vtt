00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello guys with you dork and today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 I'll show you another funny mod for 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 Minecraft games this mod adds just 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 just one block but it will be very 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 useful in this do not even doubt 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 but let's start crafting this block 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.750
 to make this block for you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.130
 need three blocks of iron one stick 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.429
 1 diamond 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.610
 barely an iron bar and you can do it 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.050
 such a unit called grant 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.170
 take this granter and put it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.879
 somewhere in the open and here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 so here it looks beautiful appear 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.559
 such funny fixes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.210
 and what is the meaning of this block 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 why do we actually need it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 we will need it to translate alone 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 resources to other 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.920
 for example using one emerald you 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.870
 can get 2 diamonds 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.469
 let's take a couple of diamonds vova 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.430
 Volga 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.430
 how much fire 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.210
 oh no i died which of these can 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.950
 to conclude you need to be careful 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.940
 ok, let's try again 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.740
 translate myrolds into diamonds and since I 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.050
 understood when we use this thing 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.910
 health decreases so we need 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.640
 stand a little bit away from her so that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.990
 you are not caught by lightning and not touched by fire 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.430
 so let's translate all our 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
 let's translate all ours and worlds in 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.790
 diamonds 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.409
 and see your can translate too 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.170
 diamonds diamonds we have translated into 10 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.369
 gold bars 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.909
 using just one diamond we 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.460
 we get as many as 10 ingots 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.740
 and so now we try to transfer gold 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 issue it that gold will be transferred as one 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.009
 gold bar translates to as many as 15 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.039
 iron bars I almost died for me 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.060
 you need to wait or eat eat 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.060
 to and golden apple 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 well, so better okay let's go now 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.879
 let's see what will be translated 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:19.030
 iron about iron we have translated into 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:20.590
 coal in short this mod 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.390
 need those who sometimes 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.269

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.319
 resource and it will be possible to translate some 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.599
