00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
puzzle ring problems like gold puttering

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.700 
puzzle ring problems like gold puttering
rug<00:00:40.890> puzzle<00:00:41.370> ring<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> palm<00:00:42.570> puzzle<00:00:43.020> ring<00:00:43.170> etc

rug puzzle ring and palm puzzle ring etc

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.490 
rug puzzle ring and palm puzzle ring etc
so<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.230> move

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so this is one of them so the first move

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.029 
so this is one of them so the first move
is<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> gold<00:00:48.120> sacrifice<00:00:48.719> gold<00:00:49.500> 8d

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
is you make this gold sacrifice gold 8d

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.880 
is you make this gold sacrifice gold 8d
well<00:00:50.670> he<00:00:50.789> can't<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.710> ollie

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
well he can't go this way it's an ollie

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
well he can't go this way it's an ollie
mating

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.140 

so<00:00:57.600> he'll<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> gold<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.730> then<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> drop

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
so he'll take the gold and then you drop

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.040 
so he'll take the gold and then you drop
silver<00:01:00.750> 27<00:01:01.470> c<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.270> King<00:01:03.480> moves<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.900> of

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
silver 27 c and the King moves out of

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.820 
silver 27 c and the King moves out of
this<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.640> drop<00:01:05.910> another<00:01:05.940> silver

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
this way and you drop another silver

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.410 
this way and you drop another silver
well<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> only<00:01:08.100> skirt<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> King<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.180> go<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
well the only skirt the King can go to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is a to f be aware of this horse is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.400 
is a to f be aware of this horse is
diagonal<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.650> yeah<00:01:16.650> silver<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.340> 9e<00:01:18.410> the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
diagonal and then yeah silver to 9e the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.670 
diagonal and then yeah silver to 9e the
gold<00:01:19.680> goes<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> 7e<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.229> silver

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
gold goes back to 7e and it's not silver

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520 
gold goes back to 7e and it's not silver
84<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> safe

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
84 it's going to get back to safe

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.999 
84 it's going to get back to safe
situation<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> silver<00:01:28.470> 8d

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
situation so so you go silver 8d

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.020 
situation so so you go silver 8d
backward<00:01:29.700> King<00:01:30.420> 60<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.290> again<00:01:32.040> silver<00:01:32.399> 7c

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
backward King 60 and again silver 7c

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
backward King 60 and again silver 7c

can make this king
so<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:49.300> take<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.630> by<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.870> silver<00:01:50.290> moving

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
so so take it by the silver moving

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.620 
so so take it by the silver moving
forward<00:01:51.400> now<00:01:52.180> King<00:01:52.450> moves<00:01:52.660> back<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:53.110> 6d<00:01:54.330> 07<00:01:55.330> see

back to Nike is pointless it goes into

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.270 
back to Nike is pointless it goes into
an<00:02:11.260> infinite<00:02:11.560> loop<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.190> do

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
an infinite loop so you have to do

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.050 
an infinite loop so you have to do
something<00:02:15.550> else<00:02:15.820> here<00:02:16.090> well<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:18.310> night<00:02:18.670> rock
