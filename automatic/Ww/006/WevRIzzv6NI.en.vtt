00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.410
 hey i 'm michael for mobile today 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.040
 here with a gaming performance demo 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.500
 the spx 12 of a relatively cheap 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.270
 smartphones or tablets or as well 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.859
 always one wants to call the part of paul 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.470
 as you can see i have a few am 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.949
 graphically challenging games 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.050
 installed and a majority of this 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 Games even run relatively smoothly 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.590
 this box 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.480
 However, there are also games where 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.790
 the device is very heavy 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.329
 For example, we would have shadowrun 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.750
 shadowrun runs absolutely fluently and is 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.040
 very much on the crate like you 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.040
 see now 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.780
 but even modern combat 3 runs smoothly 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.220
 and very playable 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.000
 We also have one about that now 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.000
 small look in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.730
 and even wild flat runs on the spx 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.230
 12 was still game here you can tell 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.090
 in between, it's always something 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.310
 but viscous runs in the big and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.170
 It is definitely still playable 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.860
 Of course, there are also some now 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.860
 small look in 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.450
 and now now getting a bit hakelig 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.660
 nova 3 is gaming 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.790
 performance already very viscous that 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.190
 is actually no longer playable 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.410
 at least there is no great fun in the game 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.860
 on here too was of natural short ones 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.860
 look in 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.009
 I 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:14.300
 and last but not least haid 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.190
 Batman strangely but apparently 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.980
 is it just that graphically 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.310
 challenging plays the games I 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.930
 Miner is here quasi 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.020
 nothing over it is one 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.210
 only ball orgy somehow here now 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.210
 will see again here 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.430
 yes that was a quick look at the game 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.509
 performance the gaming performance of the s 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.430
 p x12 which is partly really good but 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:22.509
 in some games then stop too 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:25.389
 nothing for such a cheap device 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.349
 the spx 12 actually beats 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.689
 not so bad 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.849
 shadowrun runs smoothly even modern 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.550
 Combat 3 runs smoothly so everything in 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.710
 All in all, the spx 12 does not do it that way 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.300
 bad figure 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.949
 I'm gonna michael for mobile hicks 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.029
 you liked the video gave us 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:43.110
 a thumbs up 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.110
 until next time
