using<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> rib<00:00:15.870> rack<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.890> four<00:00:17.220> slabs<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
using the rib rack I have four slabs of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
using the rib rack I have four slabs of
baby<00:00:18.359> back<00:00:18.600> ribs<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> rib<00:00:20.010> rack

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
baby back ribs in here on the rib rack

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.779 
baby back ribs in here on the rib rack
holds<00:00:20.550> five<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.449> could<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.140> six<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.189> seven<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
holds five I could do six and seven if I

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
holds five I could do six and seven if I
put<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.330> angle<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.560> how

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
put them at an angle but you can see how

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.089 
put them at an angle but you can see how
much<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.189> space<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.210> so

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
much more space I have in here so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.880 
much more space I have in here so
obviously<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> large<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
obviously this is the large one this

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
obviously this is the large one this
this<00:00:32.189> also<00:00:32.489> fits<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> small<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:34.020> rib

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this also fits on the small this rib

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
this also fits on the small this rib
rack<00:00:34.469> exactly<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> would<00:00:35.730> drop

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
rack exactly how you see it would drop

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
rack exactly how you see it would drop
right<00:00:36.149> into<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> smaller<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
right into the smaller one which is the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
right into the smaller one which is the
18<00:00:37.620> inch<00:00:37.940> which<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.270> six<00:00:39.510> inches

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
18 inch which is about six inches

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.410 
18 inch which is about six inches
smaller<00:00:40.050> than<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.520> both<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
smaller than this so in both of them you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.680 
smaller than this so in both of them you
would<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.690> able<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.200> somewhere<00:00:43.950> between

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
would be able to do somewhere between

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.290 
would be able to do somewhere between
four<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
four like you see right here up to you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
four like you see right here up to you
could<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.600> five<00:00:49.020> six<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> seven<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.480> can

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
could do five six and seven so you can

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
could do five six and seven so you can
do<00:00:51.719> seven<00:00:52.079> slabs<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.680> ribs<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.070> either<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
do seven slabs of ribs in either the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
do seven slabs of ribs in either the
large<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> small<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.079> difference<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
large or the small the difference is I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.869 
large or the small the difference is I
could<00:00:56.250> probably<00:00:56.489> turn<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:58.579> stuff<00:00:59.579> another

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
could probably turn this stuff another

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.139 
could probably turn this stuff another
rib<00:01:00.210> rack<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.489> probably<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.699> maybe

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
rib rack in here and probably get maybe

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.080 
rib rack in here and probably get maybe
10<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.960> 12<00:01:04.290> slabs<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> ribs<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.610> which<00:01:05.939> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
10 or 12 slabs of ribs on here which we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
10 or 12 slabs of ribs on here which we
be<00:01:06.510> pretty<00:01:06.780> intense<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.159> trying<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
be pretty intense so if you're trying to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.450 
be pretty intense so if you're trying to
determine<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:10.140> size<00:01:10.380> Camano<00:01:10.799> Joe<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.310> need

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
determine what size Camano Joe you need

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
determine what size Camano Joe you need
for<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
for your use think about it like this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.380 
for your use think about it like this
the<00:01:13.740> small<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> great<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> family<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
basis the smaller one you can do up to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
basis the smaller one you can do up to
14<00:01:29.159> people<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.880> might<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> run<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> couple

turkeys or
something<00:01:33.619> like<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.610> put<00:01:34.790> two

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
something like that you can put two

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.910 
something like that you can put two
turkeys<00:01:35.390> inside<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.869> here<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.439> put<00:01:36.650> one

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
turkeys inside of here you put one

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.399

turkey<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.640> two<00:01:38.090> chickens<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.930> small<00:01:39.200> one

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
turkey and two chickens in the small one

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.380 
turkey and two chickens in the small one
all<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.890> same<00:01:40.100> time<00:01:40.369> I've<00:01:40.820> actually<00:01:41.090> had

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
all the same time I've actually had

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.180 
all the same time I've actually had
seven<00:01:41.900> chickens<00:01:42.320> inside<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.830> here<00:01:42.950> cooking

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
seven chickens inside of here cooking

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.490 
seven chickens inside of here cooking
all<00:01:43.430> at<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.640> same<00:01:43.820> time<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.630> again<00:01:45.110> this<00:01:45.350> is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
all at the same time so again this is
