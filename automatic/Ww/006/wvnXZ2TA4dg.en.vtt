00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello everyone with this tutorial we started to learn about the expo messi that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 this tutorial review basically these 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.689
 three programs for what they serve let's meet them basically seductive 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.929
 and later 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.300
 may be we see them thoroughly 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.390
 first we will appreciate this noble ces or sticks in the leopard it works 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.659
 quite similar 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 change very few good things 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.280
 the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 the programs are in that hotel folder 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.820
 they can not go down 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 developer point by point with already with the iphone 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.550
 here we have all the legs of the program 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.440
 In applications you can find these three projects that in the end 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.110
 is coauthor then sell 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.199
 instruments 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:57.950
 the text 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.950
 peskov then sell instruments 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.960
 the basic 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.260
 and the main one that bbk disk can be all its applications the codec 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.830
 however 6 bilder 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.759
 is 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.550
 the user interface 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 instruments her to test their applications 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 let's open ex cox 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.560
 at the beginning it's like having nothing to show first no projects 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.550
 no matter how they put it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.840
 howard before 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.250
 we have two tabs to castelao xalapa 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 belda new project 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 percent is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 for iphone applications 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.570
 Here we can see the different ones 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.030
 the bookstore 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.740
 then we will give 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 and this is for mack 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.180
 these are not enough afternoon 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.000
 in his chest 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.549
 cough do not shut up let's start with this 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.859
 p I estatic them 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.689
 with the echo that before 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 I just want you to see how everything works 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.049
 basically three program 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.039
 frÃ©maux 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.730
 we have the point tracks 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.119
 What is it 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.119
 percent all the information of our program 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.409
 the point ap but retains some 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.119
 point even though there were never things 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.619
 the cap of law what is 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.599
 the delegate our application 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.119
 controllers 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:51.360
 a potosÃ­ 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 that those files interfere with binder and when we look 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.719
 no point aemet the central application 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.129
 already a memo drive 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.049
 here they are to assemble the organized folders 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.279
 it's like sonia sotomayor to lie 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.569
 a bar for the simulator 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.059
 Here we can configure how to compile does not apply 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.229
 and the Basque winds 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.229
 if you want to change some this only by right 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.199
 cusco sea clogs 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.199
 the drag 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.769
 let's see the point yes parco mes inter 600 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.040
 a third civilian stops 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.099
 four basic windows 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.749
 this little girl the first 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.239
 here we have 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.489
 they were not like that 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.919
 falzon ar 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.879
 the controller of the applications 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.379
 but this is answer 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.440
 that is a male that gives us 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160
 shield automatically and saw widows are tanaka 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.159
 you live the screen our iphone or master beto torch 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.559
 to go back to the bar 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:05.959
 with the battery 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.490
 it is in this aspect 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.820
 here we can change all properties of an object 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.489
 and this is the library 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.289
 here we can drag 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.969
 the island is of the 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.900
 I read Mendez 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.120
 buttons 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.379
 we want him 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.539
 that is basically inter fertile land 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.539
 we can record 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.289
 the iphone is that it enters simulator 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.090
 a simulator has done 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.650
 in the basic version 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.690
 that we will be able to test our applications in the simulator 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.059
 in the full version we can test them the simulator in darfur 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.419
 nevertheless complete prayer although it brings the same programs and everything 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.330
 allows us 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.710
 the pin pri cation to the iphone 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.439
 i send flush that senasa lapse 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.849
 with the basic license this can not be done 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 this license completes bars hundred dollars 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.370
 if they want to buy it they are in all their right 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.990
 ossuaries and purple 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.319
 we have bikini the hand 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.219
 by oct is just for the application 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.099
 foot was dedicated 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.860
 but do not show it simulated 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.029
 vilda bullet in this case compile and peace a simulator 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.669
 if they have the full license as I can impose 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:30.770
 country 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.900
 and it will happen before this is positive 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.370
 in that case you do not know the simulator 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.569
 put well they gave 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.539
 the preserve magically sharara 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.539
 the application in a simulated 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.279
 I'm sorry to see we put in then sell 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.130
 However 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.199
 nothing happens 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.120
 why 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.120
 it's basically what we have done wrong pay 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.409
 at this moment we as beings 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.409
 susana a presumed 3 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.159
 let's look 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.639
 instruments 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 basically is to know 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.830
 here what can we do 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.069
 here we can 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.210
 meadow 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.539
 that we can do 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.599
 we can review 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.139
 our application 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.139
 for errors links some will know 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.139
 the activity monitor the delegations is the use of the system 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.569
 how is he 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.539
 processor tc 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.770
 we will not admit to 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.999
 at that moment 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.150
 but basically spa that 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
 see how it is 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.189
 that's why the first Tedesco tutorial concludes 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.740
 the next I will teach you as a first concertist apply 

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:58.479
 regards
