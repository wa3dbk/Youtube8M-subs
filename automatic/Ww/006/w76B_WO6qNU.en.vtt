really gonna see is flamingo fall down
into<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.550> port<00:00:38.300> area<00:00:38.480> which<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:38.809> forgot<00:00:38.960> was

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
into the port area which I forgot was

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.880 
into the port area which I forgot was
actually<00:00:39.530> there

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
actually there

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.940 
actually there
our<00:00:40.579> girls<00:00:40.850> are<00:00:41.000> completely<00:00:41.469> but<00:00:42.469> for<00:00:42.770> some

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
our girls are completely but for some

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.040 
our girls are completely but for some
reason<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.370> port<00:00:43.610> area<00:00:43.760> looks<00:00:44.329> the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
reason the port area looks the

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.840 
reason the port area looks the
subterranean<00:00:45.530> port<00:00:45.920> area<00:00:46.100> looks<00:00:46.280> way<00:00:46.640> bigger

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
subterranean port area looks way bigger

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.420 
subterranean port area looks way bigger
now<00:00:47.210> than<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:48.200> did<00:00:48.230> back<00:00:48.590> when<00:00:48.980> we<00:00:49.160> were<00:00:49.250> with

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
now than it did back when we were with

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.550 
now than it did back when we were with
treybal<00:00:50.210> or<00:00:50.660> like<00:00:50.930> with<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.110> whole<00:00:51.260> trade

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
treybal or like with the whole trade

ball<00:00:51.770> robin<00:00:52.580> boosts<00:00:53.450> opting<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.170> know<00:00:54.260> way

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
ball robin boosts opting you know way

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.480 
ball robin boosts opting you know way
back<00:00:54.620> when<00:00:54.910> so<00:00:56.320> I'm<00:00:57.320> not<00:00:57.590> too<00:00:57.829> sure<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.430> a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
back when so I'm not too sure if it's a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.160 
back when so I'm not too sure if it's a
different<00:00:59.120> section<00:00:59.540> like<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.810> think<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.079> is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
different section like I think it is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.450 
different section like I think it is
like<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.410> different<00:01:00.530> section<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.220> port

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
like a different section of the port

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.679 
like a different section of the port
area<00:01:01.640> cuz<00:01:02.420> now<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:02.630> really<00:01:03.020> damn<00:01:03.260> big<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
area cuz now it's really damn big and

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.380 
area cuz now it's really damn big and
the<00:01:05.689> city<00:01:06.259> that<00:01:06.890> roofie<00:01:07.430> destroyed<00:01:07.790> above<00:01:08.090> is

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
the city that roofie destroyed above is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.749 
the city that roofie destroyed above is
not<00:01:08.450> like<00:01:08.900> falling<00:01:09.439> in<00:01:09.619> into<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> port<00:01:10.640> area

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
not like falling in into the port area

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.539 
not like falling in into the port area
and<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:11.630> referring<00:01:12.020> goest<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.649> his

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
and that's referring goest and his

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.330 
and that's referring goest and his
glasses<00:01:13.820> have<00:01:14.090> shattered<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.860> birdcage

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
glasses have shattered and the birdcage

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.570 
glasses have shattered and the birdcage
dissipates<00:01:17.270> such<00:01:17.630> huge<00:01:18.110> obviously<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.280> it

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
dissipates such huge obviously so it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.740 
dissipates such huge obviously so it
confirms<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.330> at<00:01:20.750> least<00:01:21.710> flamingo<00:01:22.670> has<00:01:23.330> lost

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
confirms that at least flamingo has lost

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.120 
confirms that at least flamingo has lost
control<00:01:24.050> of<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.560> birdcage

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
control of the birdcage

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.310 
control of the birdcage
you<00:01:25.550> can<00:01:25.790> see<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.090> actually<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.690> knocked<00:01:27.020> out

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
you can see the actually is knocked out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.010 
you can see the actually is knocked out
or<00:01:27.680> he's<00:01:27.830> dead<00:01:28.220> we're<00:01:28.640> not<00:01:28.790> too<00:01:29.000> sure<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:29.840> at

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.870 
or he's dead we're not too sure but at
least<00:01:30.350> he<00:01:30.650> lost<00:01:30.920> control<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.580> birdcage

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
least he lost control of the birdcage

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.990 
least he lost control of the birdcage
that's<00:01:32.330> for<00:01:32.540> sure<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.729> then<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:34.880> have

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
a good angle of like the sheer

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.230 
a good angle of like the sheer
destruction<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:25.350> what<00:03:26.350> Luffy<00:03:26.860> know<00:03:27.670> did

destruction of what Luffy know did

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.940 
destruction of what Luffy know did

saying but we don't in this chapter

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.070 
saying but we don't in this chapter
which<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.590> unfortunate<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:34.600> does<00:03:34.900> confirm

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
which is unfortunate but it does confirm

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.290 
which is unfortunate but it does confirm
that<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:36.040> bird<00:03:36.220> cage<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.580> over<00:03:36.910> it's<00:03:37.030> done<00:03:37.440> now

that the bird cage is over it's done now

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.910 
that the bird cage is over it's done now
I'm<00:03:40.300> not<00:03:40.660> too<00:03:40.989> sure<00:03:41.230> what's<00:03:41.350> going<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.500> happen

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
I'm not too sure what's going to happen

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.300 
I'm not too sure what's going to happen
to<00:03:42.280> flamingo<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.350> executives<00:03:45.870> because

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
to flamingo and the executives because

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.060 
to flamingo and the executives because
the<00:03:48.310> way<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.489> see<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.650> they<00:03:50.650> either<00:03:50.860> get

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
the way I see it is that they either get

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.460 
the way I see it is that they either get
in<00:03:51.190> prison<00:03:51.690> scimitar<00:03:52.690> like<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.900> holy<00:03:53.110> Jones

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
through the part where they somehow

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.259 
through the part where they somehow
