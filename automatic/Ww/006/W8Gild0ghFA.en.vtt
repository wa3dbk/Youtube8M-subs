 greeted by year greets children at home 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 you but I love games 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.379
 society and today I want to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 test with you the triomino this turbo 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.670
 you probably know the triomino 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.710
 this classic is well this one there is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210
 turbo he was at 3 bank side a little 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.920
 like all triomino since it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.269
 are not dominoes I do not know if 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 you always follow me in any case he 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 This is a young company that is playing out 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 with children 8 years old and over it's 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.579
 a goliath game and it's a game I have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.579
 very want to open 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.199
 what is in the box and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 well a trio timer a rule of the game 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.530
 56 triomino this then you got out 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.120
 a there to show you how it is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 fixed because when you open the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 box they are not fixed yet so 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 it's really simple 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.059
 hop said she still very sweet and so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.820
 hop here you are you click like that and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.180
 in there and then 56 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 there is a small carrying bag it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 it is very practical since it is a game 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.500
 of travel too so hop you put 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.240
 everything in the little pouch and that's 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.230
 left you who is besides as I 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.330
 tell me it's gone my cock 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.930
 I propose that we make a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 Small party 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.850
 and here is our playground is installed 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.270
 our triomino are on the starting 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 blocks 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.530
 we too dad joined me for the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.729
 disgust because a tower demo alone has 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.810
 not always easy 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.590
 welcome that's it bad loser 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.780
 trios minos 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 the goal of the game is to get rid of 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.520
 all and triomino the one who is the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.759
 first to get rid of it and well to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.500
 win and if by cons we come to a 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.380
 moment of the game where no one can 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.470
 place his trios minos and well there the one 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.569
 who's going to be a winner is the one who 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.819
 who will have the least triomino on his 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.079
 possession at that moment and if you 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.959
 tell me but if there is a tie 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.019
 in number of triomino it is well in 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.000
 these cases we count the points that are 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.890
 registered on the trios minos and the one 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.709
 with the fewest points to win 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.390
 so for the game principle in him 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.879
 even ben it's a little bit like the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.489
 dominoes except that as the word says 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.489
 triomino there are three sides so it takes 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.310
 that your triomino how can we say that 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.709
 either agree in addition put the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.769
 sides against the cotton here is where you 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.139
 have either you do either 3.0 or 0.3 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.010
 be 3.3 here you have a triomino 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:45.709
 what is karl with these numbers 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.950
 at the beginning of the game we have six pieces each 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.790
 see there and we have this wonderful 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.549
 but there it's a it's a trio 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 very exactly timer that has two 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.239
 notches then a second survival and a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.209
 other over 15 seconds but we of course 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.579
 order amateur bands there for 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.440
 stay polite we put ourselves on 15 seconds 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.519
 and we will certainly gallery is what 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.190
 you can explain a little bit 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.079
 this story of infernal buzzer 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.440
 because you will be more talented than me 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.630
 think napiÃ© I can not in fact so 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.609
 so this trio timer they serve to 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.819
 throw the game each player will have to 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.889
 paf pressed the timer before 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.919
 to place his triomino because we live 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.300
 the triomino and if he pressed for them 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.040
 Nations 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.170
 buzzer for roland it rubs off second 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.190
 map of he takes a penalty 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.790
 on the other hand if he was able to place his triomino 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.160
 ground sauce in the game eh ben after the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.290
 time is going to go will flow and if 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.790
 no one else could hand over 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.910
 triomino of one in this case each 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.830
 will pick up a triomino and forgot to 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.620
 to say that the penalty for the one who 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.020
 support and and that do not place well 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.430
 these two trios minos anyway go on 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.300
 will start this part right away 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.320
 so then, well, normally it's me 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.650
 who will start because I'm here 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.830
 girl 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.220
 so I'm pulling my already had it shoot a 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.020
 at random a triomino here and I 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:20.320
 then launch this time yes all this is to 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:22.780
 I am 3 3 3 believe will support to be 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.940

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.880
 precisely i had to support uv umbrella 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.250
 well here is the romania in these cases 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.970
 each gets a trio minos and 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.900
 alexandre commercy too nice I have not 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.640
 saw that I could not but nothing 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.650
 we learn a point so then 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.210
 now we are here now 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:51.419

 noises and movements after one 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.390

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.390

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.939
 [Applause] 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.659
 I can go too hard but normal to 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:34.189

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:37.729
 I have not any this or that pass the 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.529
 three players both ends here so 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.839
 there's what goes from ball to 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:45.949
 each one takes inputs still 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:47.539

 what is left of 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.179
 triomino drew we do not have 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.830
 shown the case where where we 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:56.659
 are we not very smart 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.179
 as a player we did not show the 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.490
 case where and buzz game but I do not 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:03.289
 place not good at the same time you have 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.019
 understood that in these cases there and well there 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.499
 nobody france two trios minos 

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:09.110

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:16.729
 would definitely go to see others will be 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.869
 the two words I believe as exactly 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.869
