00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:43.070 
peaceful all you can hear is well pretty
much<00:02:28.500> nothing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:55.100 

a<00:02:51.560> hundred<00:02:52.560> meters<00:02:52.920> ago<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.630> really

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
a hundred meters ago and it's really

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.820 
a hundred meters ago and it's really
really<00:02:55.380> narrow

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
really narrow

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.650 
really narrow
you're<00:02:56.100> basically<00:02:56.490> brushing<00:02:57.090> against<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
you're basically brushing against the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.590 
you're basically brushing against the
brush<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.970> we're<00:02:59.970> almost<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:02.150> okay<00:03:03.150> well

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
brush and we're almost there okay well

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.100 
brush and we're almost there okay well
we<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.470> made<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.280> top<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:06.050> as<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
we have made it to the top and as you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.080 
we have made it to the top and as you
can<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.710> absolutely<00:03:07.980> beautiful<00:03:08.820> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
can see it's absolutely beautiful you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.210 
can see it's absolutely beautiful you
can<00:03:09.630> see<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.050> town<00:03:10.350> we<00:03:10.620> started<00:03:11.070> at

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
can see the little town we started at

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.620 
can see the little town we started at
down<00:03:11.520> at<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> bottom<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.450> Penina<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.630> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
down at the bottom there Penina and the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750 
down at the bottom there Penina and the
top<00:03:15.840> here<00:03:16.170> isn't<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.770> very<00:03:16.800> big<00:03:17.430> actually

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
top here isn't that very big actually

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.790 
top here isn't that very big actually
it's<00:03:18.180> quite<00:03:18.420> small<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.350> think<00:03:19.500> we're<00:03:19.770> just

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
it's quite small so I think we're just

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.760 
it's quite small so I think we're just
going<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.100> stop<00:03:20.460> here<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.930> know<00:03:22.050> take<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
going to stop here and you know take it

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.500 
going to stop here and you know take it
easy<00:03:22.980> enjoy<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.090> view

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
easy enjoy the view

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.960 
easy enjoy the view
and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:25.530> head<00:03:25.920> back<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.400> which<00:03:26.670> should<00:03:26.850> be

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and then head back down which should be

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
and then head back down which should be
a<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.150> bit<00:03:27.360> easier<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.720> handle<00:03:28.350> although

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a little bit easier to handle although

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.340 
a little bit easier to handle although
it<00:03:29.370> wasn't<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.790> bad<00:03:30.030> actually<00:03:35.000> well<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:36.660> now

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
it wasn't that bad actually well we now

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.240 
it wasn't that bad actually well we now
we're<00:03:37.590> descending<00:03:38.250> from<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.610> top<00:03:38.820> and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
we're descending from the top and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
we're descending from the top and
basically<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.459> path<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:42.240> as<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> circuit<00:03:43.260> trail

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
basically the path is as a circuit trail

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.430 
basically the path is as a circuit trail
so<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:45.150> actually<00:03:45.300> ran<00:03:45.600> into<00:03:45.840> some<00:03:46.020> people<00:03:46.140> that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
so we actually ran into some people that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680 
so we actually ran into some people that
I<00:03:46.500> think<00:03:46.800> took<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.519> trail<00:03:47.910> back<00:03:48.209> down<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
I think took the trail back down the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.509 
I think took the trail back down the
same<00:03:48.900> way<00:03:48.959> they<00:03:49.230> came<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:49.890> actually<00:03:50.340> went

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
same way they came but we actually went

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.180 
same way they came but we actually went
past<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.060> top<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.600> continued<00:03:52.110> along<00:03:52.530> quite<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
past the top and continued along quite a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.860 
past the top and continued along quite a
bit<00:03:53.400> different<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.060> side<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.630> trail

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
bit different on this side of the trail

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.360 
bit different on this side of the trail
than<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.200> was<00:03:55.350> on<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.560> other<00:03:55.739> side<00:03:55.860> there's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
than it was on the other side there's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.259 
than it was on the other side there's
definitely<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.180> smoother<00:03:57.870> trail<00:03:58.200> it's<00:03:58.950> more

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
definitely a smoother trail it's more

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.690 
definitely a smoother trail it's more
expansive<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.989> bushes<00:04:01.440> lower<00:04:01.709> design<00:04:02.610> as

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
expansive the bushes lower design as

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.060 
expansive the bushes lower design as
much<00:04:02.790> abuse<00:04:03.300> there's<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.959> few<00:04:04.260> views<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.830> it's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
much abuse there's a few views but it's

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.949 
much abuse there's a few views but it's
I<00:04:05.340> mean<00:04:05.489> it's<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.700> completely<00:04:06.420> different<00:04:06.570> feel

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
I mean it's a completely different feel

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.860 
I mean it's a completely different feel
I<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.170> think<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.980> side<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.940> when<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.750> make

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
I I think on this side so when you make

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.410 
I I think on this side so when you make
it<00:04:10.080> here<00:04:10.290> which<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:10.769> will<00:04:10.980> I'm<00:04:11.160> sure<00:04:11.420> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
it here which you all will I'm sure you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.060 
it here which you all will I'm sure you
should<00:04:12.630> definitely<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> whole<00:04:13.530> circuit

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
should definitely do the whole circuit

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.550 
should definitely do the whole circuit
not<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.610> go<00:04:14.790> up<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.120> down<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.480> same<00:04:15.690> way<00:04:15.900> so

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
not just go up and down the same way so

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.610 
not just go up and down the same way so
you<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.799> get<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.919> whole<00:04:17.100> feel<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:18.470> while<00:04:19.470> it

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you can get a whole feel for it while it

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.770 
you can get a whole feel for it while it
appears<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.340> path<00:04:20.790> has<00:04:21.180> gotten<00:04:21.540> close

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
appears that the path has gotten close

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.150 
appears that the path has gotten close
to<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.109> cliffs<00:04:22.380> again<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:22.919> we're<00:04:23.070> actually

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
to the cliffs again so we're actually

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.360 
to the cliffs again so we're actually
getting<00:04:23.430> some<00:04:23.760> nice<00:04:23.910> views<00:04:24.919> you<00:04:25.919> know<00:04:26.040> every

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
getting some nice views you know every

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.580 
getting some nice views you know every
turn<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.760> different<00:04:27.210> which<00:04:27.600> makes<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.410> great

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
turn is different which makes it great

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.430 
turn is different which makes it great
really<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:32.910> spotted<00:04:33.479> some<00:04:34.050> mountain

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
really we just spotted some mountain

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.890 
really we just spotted some mountain
rock<00:04:34.950> climbers<00:04:35.520> behind<00:04:35.910> us<00:04:36.180> we're<00:04:36.540> gonna<00:04:36.630> try

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
rock climbers behind us we're gonna try

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.960 
rock climbers behind us we're gonna try
to<00:04:36.960> get<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> little<00:04:37.979> bit<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.280> close-up<00:04:38.580> and

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
to get a little bit of a close-up and

00:04:38.970 --> 00:05:18.290 
to get a little bit of a close-up and
give<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.800> view<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.860> what<00:04:41.160> they're<00:04:41.400> doing

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.740 

so<00:05:19.020> here<00:05:19.590> we<00:05:19.710> are<00:05:19.740> at<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.370> bottom<00:05:20.670> or<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.420> top

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
so here we are at the bottom or the top

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.770 
so here we are at the bottom or the top
depending<00:05:22.410> on<00:05:22.680> which<00:05:22.830> way<00:05:23.010> you're<00:05:23.160> going<00:05:23.780> but

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
depending on which way you're going but

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.470 
depending on which way you're going but
it<00:05:25.110> took<00:05:25.230> us<00:05:25.380> about<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:26.190> would<00:05:26.550> say<00:05:26.730> two<00:05:26.790> hours<00:05:27.150> I

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
it took us about I would say two hours I

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.060 
it took us about I would say two hours I
would<00:05:27.540> give<00:05:27.750> yourself<00:05:27.840> about<00:05:28.290> two<00:05:28.530> hours<00:05:28.710> it's

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
would give yourself about two hours it's
