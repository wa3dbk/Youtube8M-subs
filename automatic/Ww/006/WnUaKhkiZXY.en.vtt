my final top coat here it is it's not a

my final top coat here it is it's not a
difficult<00:02:05.539> leg<00:02:05.990> art<00:02:06.229> because<00:02:06.590> there<00:02:06.800> is<00:02:06.890> no

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
difficult leg art because there is no

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.580 
difficult leg art because there is no
symmetry<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.060> because<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> circles<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.880

corset<00:02:10.009> are<00:02:10.280> randomly<00:02:10.729> done

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890
