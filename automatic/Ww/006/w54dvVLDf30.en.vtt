00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.049 
on a little journey through punk hazard
shall<00:00:09.780> we<00:00:09.990> yes<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:11.490> actually<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.849> pretty

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
shall we yes this was actually a pretty

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.150 
shall we yes this was actually a pretty
fun<00:00:12.360> episode<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.139> involved<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.650> lot<00:00:13.679> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
fun episode that involved a lot of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.310 
fun episode that involved a lot of
different<00:00:14.759> characters<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.199> can

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
different characters but I think we can

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
different characters but I think we can
all<00:00:16.470> probably<00:00:16.920> agree<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.520> Tasha<00:00:17.730> he<00:00:18.029> was

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
all probably agree that Tasha he was

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.910 
all probably agree that Tasha he was
probably<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.750> most<00:00:18.779> important<00:00:19.500> character<00:00:19.890> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
probably the most important character in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710 
probably the most important character in
this<00:00:20.160> week's<00:00:20.369> episode<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.060> now<00:00:21.660> she

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this week's episode and now she

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.929 
this week's episode and now she
definitely<00:00:22.199> displayed<00:00:22.859> her<00:00:23.100> intense<00:00:23.609> loyalty

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
