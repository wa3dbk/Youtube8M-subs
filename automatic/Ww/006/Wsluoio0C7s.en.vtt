00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
extension there because I realize that

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.000

seen 104 I mean point version point 1 if
they<00:00:34.250> if<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> computer<00:00:35.760> already<00:00:35.910> recognized

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
they if the computer already recognized

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.130 
they if the computer already recognized
it<00:00:36.840> recognizes<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> extension<00:00:38.840> anyways<00:00:39.840> uh

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a lot here first of all I'm just going

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
a lot here first of all I'm just going

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to press the start button probably might

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
to press the start button probably might
not<00:00:58.440> notice<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.370> I've<00:00:59.489> changed<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
not notice this but I've changed the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.280 
not notice this but I've changed the
startup<00:01:00.660> image<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.129> handle

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
startup image a little bit to handle

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
startup image a little bit to handle
better<00:01:04.290> check<00:01:04.589> something<00:01:04.890> quickly<00:01:05.330> yeah<00:01:06.330> good

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
better check something quickly yeah good

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
better check something quickly yeah good
okay<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.610> handle<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> whole<00:01:10.610> startup<00:01:11.610> thing

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
okay to handle the whole startup thing

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580 
okay to handle the whole startup thing
because<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.720> people<00:01:13.020> were<00:01:13.170> apparently

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because some people were apparently

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
because some people were apparently
missing<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.280> image<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
missing this image here right like it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
missing this image here right like it
wasn't<00:01:15.960> showing<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> game<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.790> I've

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wasn't showing up in the game so I've

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
wasn't showing up in the game so I've
changed<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> different<00:01:19.229> image<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
changed it to a different image that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.820 
changed it to a different image that
everyone<00:01:20.640> should<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.110> startup<00:01:24.830> then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
everyone should have on the startup then

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
everyone should have on the startup then
I<00:01:26.460> also<00:01:26.640> realized<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I also realized that because of the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.910 
I also realized that because of the
override<00:01:28.799> code<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:31.520> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> bot<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:33.600> people

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
override code and in the bot some people

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
override code and in the bot some people
might<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.280> even<00:01:35.430> noticed<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
might not have even noticed that it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
might not have even noticed that it
wasn't<00:01:36.540> finding<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> startup<00:01:37.350> image<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
wasn't finding the startup image and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.580 
wasn't finding the startup image and
that<00:01:38.340> might<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.729> some<00:01:38.970> issues<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.930> might

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that might be some issues that might

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
that might be some issues that might
have<00:01:40.680> caused<00:01:40.860> some<00:01:41.070> issues<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.430> bought<00:01:42.329> not
