trashcan jokes or r2d2 jokes I think

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.559 
trashcan jokes or r2d2 jokes I think
deep<00:02:53.250> down<00:02:53.280> once<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> take<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> look<00:02:54.239> inside

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569

deep down once you take a look inside
you<00:02:54.720> got<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.959> admit<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.620> beautiful<00:02:56.069> piece

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
you got to admit it is a beautiful piece

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
you got to admit it is a beautiful piece

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
Twitter asking how it is to access the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.030 
Twitter asking how it is to access the
back<00:03:42.630> once<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.079> Mac<00:03:43.260> Pro<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.530> sitting<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.010> your

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
back once the Mac Pro is sitting on your

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.650 
back once the Mac Pro is sitting on your
desk<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.579> actually<00:03:44.820> pretty<00:03:44.910> easy<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
desk and it's actually pretty easy the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940 
desk and it's actually pretty easy the
top<00:03:45.870> kind<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.140> acts<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> handle<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:46.860> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
top kind of acts as the handle so you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.710 
top kind of acts as the handle so you
just<00:03:47.100> spin<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.340> around<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:48.030> back<00:03:48.269> actually

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
just spin it around the back actually

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.090 
just spin it around the back actually
lights<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.380> then<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.650> access<00:03:50.070> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
lights up and then you have access to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.100 
lights up and then you have access to
all<00:03:50.459> your<00:03:50.610> ports<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.660> for<00:03:51.780> kicks<00:03:51.930> to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
all your ports and just for kicks to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.690 
all your ports and just for kicks to
give<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.320> guys<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.709> more<00:03:52.739> example<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.610> how

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
give you guys one more example of how

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.699 
give you guys one more example of how

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
small the Mac Pro is here is how it

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.080 
small the Mac Pro is here is how it

you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.600> see<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> note<00:03:58.019> 3<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.560> more<00:03:58.829> than

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
you can see the note 3 it's more than

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.979 
you can see the note 3 it's more than
half<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.489> size<00:03:59.730> of<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.030> Mac<00:04:00.180> Pro<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.600> for

half the size of the Mac Pro and for

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.479 
half the size of the Mac Pro and for
even<00:04:01.200> more<00:04:01.350> fun<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:01.890> shorter<00:04:02.250> than<00:04:02.400> that

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
even more fun it is shorter than that

against<00:04:16.829> each<00:04:17.010> other<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:17.669> decide<00:04:17.970> which

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
against each other and then decide which
