 links that are going to be loaded by three 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.100
 options per mega one side place a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.899
 either one of them sells it 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 any of the movies can be 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.220
 download and good here is under the

 erase and good already after having the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.340
 program they extract it look at the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.220
 instructions that are only two 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.430
 steps to install and ready already after 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.319
 the program will open normally 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.250
 totally full avoids the champions and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.489
 2014 that is compatible for windows 8.1 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.170
 windows 8 and whistled to the version below 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.519
 about windows and macos 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.500
 we do not have to open us is the campus and 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.750
 well I told them I did not know the new 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.069
 2014 interface of the champions and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.750
 study 14 and good in this edition this 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 I liked it because this version comes for 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.870
 record movies from a sisi in the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.060
 that setting of the audio indie and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.250
 well this time not clear as the version 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 where the we did not like that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.090
 it suited us 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.939
 and well here we can give options of 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 each film presentation or create 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.719
 bluray presentation films if yes 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.200
 incidentally bluray but in this case the 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.459
 most do not have a normal cd to divide 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.980
 and good here have several decisions 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.940
 for 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 also that brings to record image already 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 be an operating system that they want 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.769
 record create image 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.069
 there is not even record create and 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.069
 browse performance that serves to 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.060
 so you can see what's in the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.220
 image and I etcetera and good that they give us 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.170
 a water functionalities will have what 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.750
 has not worked against this program 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.970
 will have to review each of these in 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 this case we are going to focus on can 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.600
 create an audio script 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.580
 but let's create the movie is that not 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.580
 let's create movie presentation 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 and well here we only put the name 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.860
 of the film in this case puts proof 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.690
 being 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.050
 commented that we will use the format of the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.050
 balloon 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.959
 morality in a row 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.190
 good here the important thing that we go here 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.190
 let's add the movie 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.550
 here they are going to add the movie you 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.550
 want in the video document 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.190
 for example here I have several movies 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.080
 of the videos that I have uploaded for reading 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.940
 can burn anything you 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.910
 a movie that has been downloaded and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.800
 they want to see a giant screen and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.050
 well here you give incident 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.050
 well this important here and here we 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.540
 there is a new menu 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.720
 at least to visualize 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.840
 for example echo 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.510
 but if in this case they do not like to use 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.730
 only mark the empty one in using 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.280
 minors and there you will reproduce the 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.350
 video normally, they only have one 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.710
 circus used brand-name brand 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.370
 pasta and if the template that more 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.460
 like it 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.660
 axel translation 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.729
 does not have a very good template 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.490
 for example let's leave a 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.600
 one of these stops 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.670
 one 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.090
 or this 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.030
 this herd that I like more the guarantee 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:42.529
 I like it a lot but good 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.019
 now I have so let's go to a 5 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.939
 and well here we are going to modify the 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:49.759
 template will be seeing in the background 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:52.269
 adding an image as floating the 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.269
 buttons 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.300
 with this cochineal can you see 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.000
 two other conditions for the 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.180
 multiple 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.910
 let's go in hundred and let's record the 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.070
 next disc and good I do not have 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.200
 I have the unit disabled by 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.800
 now but it will not decide me but you 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.690
 and only that third blank 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.390
 wait for the civilian to be verified and they give 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.330
 next and start taking 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.759
 automatically 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.169
 good youtube friends all about this 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.099
