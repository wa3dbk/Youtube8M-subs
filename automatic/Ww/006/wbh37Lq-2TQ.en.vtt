guy named Mike or FearCrads chances are
you<00:01:24.869> guys<00:01:25.049> already<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:25.680> guys<00:01:25.860> because

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you guys already know these guys because

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
you guys already know these guys because
they're<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:26.670> big<00:01:26.880> youtubers<00:01:27.479> already<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they're pretty big youtubers already but

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490 
they're pretty big youtubers already but
uh<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:30.210> reason<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> say<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.110> they

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
uh the reason I say that is because they

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
uh the reason I say that is because they
put<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.770> daily<00:01:32.100> moab<00:01:32.610> gameplay<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
put up daily moab gameplay which is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
put up daily moab gameplay which is
incredible<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.350> them<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.130> able<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> get

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
incredible for them to be able to get

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.780 
incredible for them to be able to get
that<00:01:35.610> many<00:01:35.729> Moab's<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:37.110> um<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.560> guess<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.700> they

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that many Moab's but um i guess if they

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
that many Moab's but um i guess if they
