know at least it earlier versions you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.870 
know at least it earlier versions you
couldn't<00:03:11.609> so<00:03:11.760> always<00:03:12.690> select<00:03:13.530> quit<00:03:13.880> after

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
couldn't so always select quit after

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.059 
couldn't so always select quit after
that<00:03:15.269> we'll<00:03:15.510> go<00:03:15.630> ahead<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.700> eject<00:03:17.880> our<00:03:18.269> disk

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:39.740 

and<00:03:24.069> they<00:03:24.219> will<00:03:24.400> reboots<00:03:25.030> machine

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:50.030 

so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.080 

so<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.400> here<00:03:51.610> we're<00:03:51.760> back<00:03:51.910> under

you should be able to get into they work
with<00:04:11.580> XP<00:04:12.580> through<00:04:12.790> Windows<00:04:13.120> 7<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.720> haven't

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
with XP through Windows 7 I haven't

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.880

tested<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.530> Windows<00:04:14.830> 8<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.680> I'll<00:04:17.739> just

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
tested it on Windows 8 so I'll just

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.490 
tested it on Windows 8 so I'll just
let's<00:04:18.070> find<00:04:18.280> out<00:04:18.400> about<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:19.320> but<00:04:20.320> basically

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
let's find out about that but basically

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.080 
let's find out about that but basically
if<00:04:20.830> you<00:04:21.010> have<00:04:21.220> physical<00:04:21.400> access<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.970> the

if you have physical access to the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.970 
if you have physical access to the
machine<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:23.020> get<00:04:23.170> in<00:04:23.290> there<00:04:23.500> do<00:04:23.770> whatever

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
machine you can get in there do whatever

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.250 
machine you can get in there do whatever
you<00:04:24.160> need<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.340> do<00:04:28.020> so

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
you need to do so

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.890 
you need to do so
let's<00:04:30.100> verify<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:30.820> have<00:04:30.900> every

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
let's verify that we have every

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:44.000 
let's verify that we have every
ridiculous

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.020 

we're<00:04:44.700> going<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.910> see<00:04:45.210> our<00:04:45.330> test<00:04:45.600> account<00:04:47.030> and

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
we're going to see our test account and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.220 
we're going to see our test account and
indeed<00:04:48.360> we<00:04:48.630> remove<00:04:48.900> easily<00:04:49.020> administered

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
indeed we remove easily administered

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.020 
indeed we remove easily administered
your<00:04:49.680> screw<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.140> only<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.530> two<00:04:52.680> guys

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
your screw so it's only as two guys
