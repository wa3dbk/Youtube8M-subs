00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
something like that heard some along

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.609 
something like that heard some along
those<00:00:28.949> lines<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.340> uh<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.000> guess<00:00:30.689> something<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
those lines but uh I guess something to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.490 
those lines but uh I guess something to
the<00:00:31.710> effect<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.399> her<00:00:32.850> lack<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.500> having

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the effect you know her lack of having

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.830 
the effect you know her lack of having
no<00:00:34.559> knowledge<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.210> knowledge<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.660> God

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
no knowledge and we know knowledge I God

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
no knowledge and we know knowledge I God
not<00:00:37.020> disease<00:00:37.469> itself<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:38.399> some

hole basically and what their what
they've<00:00:45.149> done<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.539> they've<00:00:45.780> gone<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
they've done is they've gone in and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
they've done is they've gone in and
successfully<00:00:47.309> closed<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.120> med

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
successfully closed it up you know med

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
successfully closed it up you know med
that<00:00:48.420> everything<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that everything got it you know back in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.520 
that everything got it you know back in
order<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.370> he's<00:00:50.520> probably<00:00:50.700> gonna<00:00:50.969> have

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
order so he's probably gonna have

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.270 
order so he's probably gonna have
probably<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.649> least<00:00:52.739> another<00:00:53.010> couple<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
probably at least another couple of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
probably at least another couple of
months<00:00:53.399> before<00:00:53.610> he<00:00:53.879> did<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.899> he's<00:00:55.590> got

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
months before he did you know he's got

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
months before he did you know he's got
to<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.920> through<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.160> healing<00:00:56.489> process<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to go through that healing process and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
to go through that healing process and
he's<00:00:57.539> gotta<00:00:57.719> start<00:00:58.079> his<00:00:58.289> training<00:00:58.469> back<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
he's gotta start his training back up to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
he's gotta start his training back up to
I<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.609> imagine<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.000> can't<00:01:00.270> start<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.500> know

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I would imagine you can't start you know

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
I would imagine you can't start you know
training<00:01:02.550> especially<00:01:02.730> his<00:01:03.149> training<00:01:03.449> regimen

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
training especially his training regimen

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.119 
training especially his training regimen
