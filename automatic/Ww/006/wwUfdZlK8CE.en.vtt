00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.139
 good morning high mastern today 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 will talk about what can be done from 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.049
 old newspapers to start old newspapers 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.699
 need to cut into strips 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.279
 and the strips using the rod spokes or 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.680
 kebab sticks included in thin 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.890
 tubules as done and so take 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 the wagon and for the corner we wind on 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:54.180
 barbecue stick so that the strip does not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:56.989
 unwound we fix with glue we understand 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.790
 kebab bag 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.640
 it turned out a newspaper tube 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.530
 but from such tubes can be done 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 many interesting things 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.930
 and today we are going to make from chimneys 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.320
 pendant for him we need 5-6 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 workers 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.590
 all the tubes and glue together in 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 the length 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:35.230
 for convenience, you can use instead 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.230
 clamping clothespin continue to glue 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.979
 glued tubes roll up into a snail 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 when there was only one curl 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:19.190
 make a loop for the pendant with 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:19.190
 pencil put a pencil and glue 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.220
 fasten with a clothespin to stick together 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.269
 now take out the pencil and attach the clone 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.269
 to this foundation 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:05.140
 that's what happened next 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.140
 we treat someone with wood putty 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.500
 putty a lot do not need relief which 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.250
 gives tubules we will not be completely 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.250
 overwrite 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 so that the putty can dry faster 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.600
 you can use such a pendant 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.560
 decorate decoupage gilding 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 marmor 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.060
 and we will color 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.560
 golden blends well with blue 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.650
 Now you need to wait until the paint 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.340
 dry continue to decorate the pendant 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.340
 rhinestones 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.760
 to our mother 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.100
 further decorate the clone contours on glass 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.770
 Well 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.460
 count ready now can be fixed on 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.490

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.490

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.970
