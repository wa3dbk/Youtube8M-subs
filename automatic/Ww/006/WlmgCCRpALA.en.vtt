 the season change again 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.710
 like every year last season's clothes have been messed up crumpled and 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.710
 even spoiled 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.660
 and as every year the pharaonic task of trying to put all 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 the clothes in the cupboards 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.359
 no matter how the position is the clothes occupy so much space that the votes are 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
 they fill up right away without you barely managing to save anything 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.879
 with the new covers all these problems have finished the bags 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:34.090
 saves space are the solution you were waiting for 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.630
 in a fast and simple way you will get that it lasted little but until

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 side opening is tightly closed 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.700
 it is enough to put the conspirator's mouthpiece on the valve of the bag and 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 Your space problems are over 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.860
 You will see how the bag shrinks as the vacuum cleaner draws trapped air 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.300
 in her 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 you just have to put the cap on the valve and the bag is ready 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.420
 to save 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.159
 Quilts that are usually so difficult to handle in a few seconds 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.320
 are reduced to a size with which you will easily find sung hollow in 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.410

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.160
 compare the difference the bag allows you to store your clothes and throw them away 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.180
 perfectly and will occupy a quarter of what it occupied before and also 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.300
 allows you to handle the very comfortably facilitating the task of saving it 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.350
 the blankets the jerseys the shirts and any other garment are no longer a

 problem 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.190
 observe how the size changes the volume that previously occupied is reduced 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 to a minimum part

 clothes that are otherwise very bulky can go to the wardrobe without 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.830
 no space problem 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.800
