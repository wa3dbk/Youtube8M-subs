00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.350 
work it's a chance for them to push
their<00:01:27.830> practice<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.460> stretch<00:01:28.820> themselves<00:01:29.030> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
their practice to stretch themselves a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.260 
their practice to stretch themselves a
bit<00:01:30.189> we're<00:01:31.189> looking<00:01:31.460> at<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> variety<00:01:31.850> of

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
bit we're looking at a variety of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.700 
bit we're looking at a variety of
different<00:01:32.689> approaches<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.350> making<00:01:33.530> a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
different approaches to making a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.880 
different approaches to making a
portrait<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.429> they<00:01:35.030> might<00:01:35.270> be<00:01:35.570> very<00:01:36.259> used<00:01:36.710> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
portrait so they might be very used to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.499 
portrait so they might be very used to
drawing<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.340> paper<00:01:37.520> with<00:01:37.789> pencils<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:38.390> they

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
drawing on paper with pencils but they

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.810 
drawing on paper with pencils but they
might<00:01:38.689> never<00:01:38.869> attempted<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.860> make<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.399> portrait

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
might never attempted to make a portrait

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.999 
might never attempted to make a portrait
out<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.240> tissue<00:01:41.869> paper<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.409> they've<00:01:42.560> torn<00:01:42.830> up

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
out of tissue paper that they've torn up

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.310 
out of tissue paper that they've torn up
so<00:01:43.280> they'll<00:01:43.759> be<00:01:43.850> trying<00:01:44.119> different<00:01:44.320> materials

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
so they'll be trying different materials

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.779 
so they'll be trying different materials
different<00:01:45.500> approaches<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.549> might<00:01:46.759> just

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
different approaches and it might just

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.940 
different approaches and it might just
kind<00:01:47.209> of<00:01:47.240> give<00:01:47.390> them<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.539> bit<00:01:47.720> more<00:01:47.750> scope<00:01:48.259> we're

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
kind of give them a bit more scope we're

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.840 
kind of give them a bit more scope we're
making<00:01:49.250> their<00:01:49.369> own<00:01:49.399> work<00:01:51.340> there<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:52.459> as<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
making their own work there now as you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.870 
making their own work there now as you
can<00:01:53.149> see<00:01:53.860> people's<00:01:54.860> confidence<00:01:55.250> growing<00:01:55.700> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
can see people's confidence growing and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.960 
can see people's confidence growing and
their<00:01:56.049> drawings<00:01:57.049> improving<00:01:57.649> enormous<00:01:58.069> ly<00:01:58.280> you
