where this summer is skinny upon us and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.890 
where this summer is skinny upon us and
it's<00:00:35.550> getting<00:00:35.850> hot<00:00:36.060> outside<00:00:38.180> okay<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> AC<00:00:39.570> in

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
it's getting hot outside okay the AC in

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's getting hot outside okay the AC in
this<00:00:40.050> car<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.620> blowing<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.610> set<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.420> 74

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this car is blowing it is set at 74

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.140 
this car is blowing it is set at 74
degrees<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.040> blowing<00:00:44.400> hot<00:00:44.610> air<00:00:44.850> right

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
degrees but it's blowing hot air right

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.030 
degrees but it's blowing hot air right
now<00:00:45.180> feels<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.290> in<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.559> car<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.010> now

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
now feels like in this car right now

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.930 
now feels like in this car right now
about<00:00:47.600> 86<00:00:48.600> degrees<00:00:48.860> though<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.070> set<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.280> 74

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
about 86 degrees though it's set at 74

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990 
about 86 degrees though it's set at 74
degrees<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.250> now<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> run<00:00:53.850> our

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
degrees so now we're going to run our

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
degrees so now we're going to run our
Diagnostics<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:54.870> find<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.470> can<00:00:55.800> we

Diagnostics and find out how can we

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
Diagnostics and find out how can we
solve<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> fix<00:00:57.150> this<00:00:57.330> issue<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.050> BMW

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
solve and fix this issue for this BMW

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.710 
solve and fix this issue for this BMW
customer<00:01:00.589> this<00:01:01.589> day<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.400> we<00:01:02.550> found<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
customer this day is that we found that

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.170 
customer this day is that we found that
his<00:01:03.900> AC<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.500> leaking<00:01:04.890> freon<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.370> he<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:06.000> AC

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
his AC is leaking freon and he has no AC

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.600 
his AC is leaking freon and he has no AC
in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> system<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.920> today<00:01:08.100> we're

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in the system so we're at today we're

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.149 
in the system so we're at today we're
adding<00:01:09.000> some<00:01:09.210> die<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> system<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
adding some die in the system which is a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.899 
adding some die in the system which is a
typical<00:01:12.060> hose<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.560> hook<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.980> onto<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.670> AC

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
typical hose you hook it up onto the AC

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
typical hose you hook it up onto the AC
system<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.440> do<00:01:16.620> is<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.920> inject<00:01:17.370> dye

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
system and what we do is we inject dye

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
system and what we do is we inject dye
into<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.120> system<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.810> after<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.590> let<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> run

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
into the system and after we let it run

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.940 
into the system and after we let it run
for<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.460> 20<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> 30<00:01:21.120> minutes<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:22.229> use<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> black

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
for like 20 to 30 minutes we use a black

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
for like 20 to 30 minutes we use a black
light<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.610> find<00:01:23.940> where<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.360> leaking<00:01:24.570> at

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
light to find where it's leaking at

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
light to find where it's leaking at
there<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.590> other<00:01:25.740> ways<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.550> it<00:01:26.730> there<00:01:27.060> are

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
there are other ways to do it there are

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.200 
there are other ways to do it there are
ways<00:01:27.510> we<00:01:27.870> use<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.800> snoop<00:01:29.340> tester<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> snoop

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
ways we use a snoop tester a snoop

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600 
ways we use a snoop tester a snoop
tester<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.740> inject<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
tester is where we actually inject the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
tester is where we actually inject the
freon<00:01:32.970> into<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> system<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.080> will

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
freon into the system and this will

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
freon into the system and this will
actually<00:01:34.890> find<00:01:35.490> any<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.150> smell<00:01:36.750> any<00:01:36.990> leak

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
actually find any and smell any leak

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.430 
actually find any and smell any leak
into<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.800> system<00:01:38.480> another<00:01:39.480> way<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
into the system another way is for the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.350 
into the system another way is for the
do-it-yourselfers<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> soap

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
do-it-yourselfers is you could do soap

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
do-it-yourselfers is you could do soap
and<00:01:42.540> water<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:43.260> that's<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:43.710> first<00:01:44.070> started

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and water we that's how we first started

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
and water we that's how we first started
out<00:01:44.490> when<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.760> didn't<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.690> all<00:01:45.870> these<00:01:45.990> fancy

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
out when we didn't have all these fancy

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830 
out when we didn't have all these fancy
equipments<00:01:46.980> we<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.520> added<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.150> freon<00:01:48.540> into

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
equipments we just added the freon into

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.930 
equipments we just added the freon into
the<00:01:48.930> system<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.650> can<00:01:50.100> check<00:01:50.370> for<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> leak

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
the system now we can check for a leak

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.200 
the system now we can check for a leak
