00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.020
 good 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.540
 one of the many original eggs that 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.760
 have gone through p esp has been crazy rocco 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.360
 of which we analyze the first delivery 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.939
 appeared in the year 2006 in this madness 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.400
 minimalist we do not control the character 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.220
 principal but to the ground where it 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 move the crazy red are a nice 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.340
 species mostly round and almost 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.460
 gelatinous that lives on the planet 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.410
 accompanied by other friends the very very 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 both live in peace and tranquility 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.540
 Spending his days without the least 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.820
 worry until one day the planet 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.589
 is invaded by the wet creatures 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.409
 black whose design is a mixture of 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.989
 octopus and hedgehog ready to create chaos 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.229
 and also like to eat the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.900
 crazy red our mission was to save 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.610
 as many crazy red as we could for 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.970
 we just had to use three 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.010
 buttons the top buttons the closure 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.140
 and the circle button 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.810
 if we press one of the two buttons 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.050
 top we tilt the screen towards 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.930
 that direction the world was bowing and the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.880
 crazy red would slide towards there if 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.760
 we press the two buttons and at the same time 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.070
 the floor rumbles making the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.350
 crazy red so high according to the time that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.620
 pressure we do both buttons at the same time 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.720
 to enlarge this nice character 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.850
 we had to eat berries a kind 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.370
 of flower each time it was enlarged 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.710
 it represented that we had rescued a 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.830
 new red logo on each level had 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.990
 up to a maximum of 20 but not everything would be 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.420
 so easy down the road we find 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.610
 narrow areas where we had to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.940
 divide the crazy red in so many parts 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 as we had crazy for it had to 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.050
 Repeatedly press the circle button 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.970
 as well as to train the screen in 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.640
 the two directions to collect the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.100
 all again gathering those in the great 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.730
 crazy red when you hold down the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.680
 circle button 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.840
 along the way and we are finding 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.790
 our friends very very some of the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.940
 which were hidden in zones 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.950
 secret these characters gave us 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.950
 elements to decorate our crazy house 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.319
 with a lot of objects available 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 also and we are picking itching that 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.120
 they allowed us to play mini powers of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.610
 all the dangers the most elements 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.860
 highlights were the terminals or thorns and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.230
 the wet ones that could even be eaten 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.019
 some of our crazy reds as well as 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.180
 stop us from knowing strangers 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.250
 characters move for different challenges 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.590
 control the crazy reds of various 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.239
 colors that some characters will change 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.370
 our way to solve certain 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 situations are just some of the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.530
 actions that we did during the game 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.030
 with a colorful minimalist design 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.129
 with a very basic gameplay 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.829
 for the very fun time and a 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.019
 music we still remember crazy red 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.329
 it was one of the most original games and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.860
 funny psc that have gone through 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.990
 our hands 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.870
 and in the next delivery and by request 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.870
