old<00:00:39.140> ash<00:00:39.530> tree<00:00:39.909> it's<00:00:40.909> very<00:00:41.150> badly<00:00:41.480> decayed<00:00:42.020> and

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
old ash tree it's very badly decayed and

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.520 
old ash tree it's very badly decayed and
the<00:00:43.489> top<00:00:43.699> of<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:45.170> dying<00:00:45.620> back<00:00:47.230> it's<00:00:48.230> over

the top of it is dying back it's over

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.160 
the top of it is dying back it's over
the<00:00:48.649> top<00:00:48.879> potentially<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:49.940> leans<00:00:50.210> towards<00:00:50.960> me

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the top potentially it leans towards me

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.160 
the top potentially it leans towards me
and<00:00:51.430> if<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.609> tree<00:00:52.850> fell<00:00:53.149> which<00:00:53.449> is<00:00:53.660> very<00:00:53.930> badly

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
and if the tree fell which is very badly

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.099 
and if the tree fell which is very badly
decayed<00:00:54.649> at<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> bottom<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:56.690> would<00:00:56.930> go

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
decayed at the bottom and it would go

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.160 
decayed at the bottom and it would go
towards<00:00:57.500> some<00:00:57.620> houses<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:58.100> are<00:00:58.160> behind<00:00:58.370> me

what<00:01:00.170> we're<00:01:00.440> doing<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:02.350> taking<00:01:03.350> off<00:01:04.390> some<00:01:05.390> of

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
what we're doing is taking off some of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.120 
what we're doing is taking off some of
the<00:01:05.570> bowels<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.170> are<00:01:06.289> over<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.649> garden<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
the bowels that are over the garden the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.139 
the bowels that are over the garden the
weight<00:01:07.399> off<00:01:07.429> this<00:01:07.910> side<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.729> we<00:01:10.970> can

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
weight off this side so that we can

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.690 
weight off this side so that we can
address<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.950> shift<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.070> balance<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.550> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
address the shift the balance of the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.480 
address the shift the balance of the
tree<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:13.940> little<00:01:14.030> bit<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.690> then<00:01:14.920> finally<00:01:15.920> we'll

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
tree a little bit and then finally we'll

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.749 
tree a little bit and then finally we'll
pull<00:01:16.819> the<00:01:16.849> tree<00:01:17.300> with<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.869> winch<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:19.340> opposite

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
pull the tree with a winch the opposite

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.300 
pull the tree with a winch the opposite
way<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.240> house<00:01:20.619> into<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.740> park<00:01:22.009> that's

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
way to the house into the park that's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.520 
way to the house into the park that's
just<00:01:22.910> behind<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.200> matter<00:01:24.349> of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
just behind you it's a matter of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.449 
just behind you it's a matter of
ascending<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.069> tree<00:01:25.509> I'll<00:01:26.509> put<00:01:26.720> lock<00:01:26.899> up<00:01:27.459> the

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
ascending the tree I'll put lock up the

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.160 
ascending the tree I'll put lock up the
first<00:01:28.700> anchor<00:01:29.119> point<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:29.569> there<00:01:29.810> we've<00:01:30.020> used

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
first anchor point up there we've used

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.190 
first anchor point up there we've used
the<00:01:30.349> throw<00:01:30.560> line<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.979> get<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.220> Rope<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.640> and

rope off on so just going to work your
way<00:01:45.830> up<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:46.190> little<00:01:46.459> bit<00:01:46.580> higher<00:01:46.759> on<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:47.179> stem

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.449 

this<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:51.709> where<00:01:51.860> we're<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.220> set<00:01:52.429> a

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
this is where we're going to set a

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.080 
this is where we're going to set a
pulley<00:01:52.789> up<00:01:53.000> for<00:01:53.239> lowering<00:01:54.910> some<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
pulley up for lowering some of the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.790 
pulley up for lowering some of the
branches<00:01:56.330> off<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:57.259> we're<00:01:57.379> going<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.649> take

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
branches off that we're going to take

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.109 
branches off that we're going to take
off<00:01:58.039> here<00:01:58.840> below<00:02:00.069> just<00:02:01.069> throw<00:02:01.340> me<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.550> rope<00:02:01.759> a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
off here below just throw me a rope a

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.690 
off here below just throw me a rope a
little<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.629> higher<00:02:02.840> octave<00:02:03.550> taking<00:02:04.550> these

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
little the higher octave taking these

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.100 
little the higher octave taking these
off<00:02:04.940> on<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.330> be<00:02:05.420> in<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.539> comfortable<00:02:05.780> position

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
off on to be in a comfortable position

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.609 
off on to be in a comfortable position
basically<00:02:06.800> for<00:02:07.190> positioning<00:02:07.789> go<00:02:08.619> we've

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
basically for positioning go we've

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
basically for positioning go we've
pulleys<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.009> things

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.899 

her<00:02:13.810> I'll<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.499> these<00:02:14.709> bits<00:02:15.069> just<00:02:15.189> in<00:02:15.489> front<00:02:15.700> of

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
her I'll do these bits just in front of

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.539 
her I'll do these bits just in front of
me<00:02:16.379> looking<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.769> do<00:02:17.889> them<00:02:18.069> relatively

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
me looking I can do them relatively

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.160 
me looking I can do them relatively
smaller<00:02:18.999> we<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.329> just<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.659> feel<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.109> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
smaller we can just get a feel for the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
smaller we can just get a feel for the
system<00:02:25.049> better

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.460 

that's<00:02:33.970> rigged<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.450> ready<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.990> me<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> use

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's rigged up ready for me to use

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.610 
that's rigged up ready for me to use
their<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.840> right<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.350> I'm<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
their I can get it right so I'm going to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.390 
their I can get it right so I'm going to
bob<00:02:38.830> down<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> bit<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.520> take<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.030> two

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
bob down a bit and take one or two

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.160 
bob down a bit and take one or two
smaller<00:02:42.400> bits<00:02:42.670> out<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.210> way<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.990> they're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
smaller bits out of the way that they're

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.690 
smaller bits out of the way that they're
just<00:02:44.320> going<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.760> our<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:48.550> might

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
