00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.350
 cry of joy 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.240
 the officers themselves 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.240
 wow look he speaks french 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.390
 psychological reception which 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.470
 they brought me 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.970
 support drive up 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.000
 here and so on I continue 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.000
 but 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.720

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.260
 with me were the utmost polite and me 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 talked 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.849
 very very very simple phrases that is 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.760
 not understand anything there was very hard 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.400
 in my opinion 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.900
 may eventually have started talking 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:24.240
 about 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.520
 history history of teaching I add up 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.699
 the fact that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.339
 I wrote that we somewhere jaws 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.349
 Scotland 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:35.449
 I started to throw 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.990
 otherwise this question is about what is 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.270
 great what exactly you wrote there is not how 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.820
 are you there like 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 again it was all directed to 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.600
 to find out how much i'm talking 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.210
 French 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.050
 once again I want to tell you that 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.050
 in my feelings 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.610
 everything 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.990
 all the questions and the meeting itself she is back 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.660
 quantity to check 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.380
 The originals of your documents are my second 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.790
 feeling 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.860
 and my second impression is that 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.990
 there is absolutely no migration officer 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.210
 no intention and desire of you 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.350
 it seemed to fill up the other way around me that 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.740
 his installation on the contrary 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:28.600

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.890
 exactly one hour 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.410
 at the end of the interview, I was told the crown 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:39.090

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.240
 there he is badly treated there from him 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.669
 expect something 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.650
 he initially did not want to not give 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.030
 certificate of selection and rendezvous with 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.010

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.949
