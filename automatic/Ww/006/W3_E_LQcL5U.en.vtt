00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
equalizer and pretty much that was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760 
equalizer and pretty much that was
hardly<00:01:33.180> ever<00:01:33.299> finish<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.810> unfortunately<00:01:34.380> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
hardly ever finish so unfortunately we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
hardly ever finish so unfortunately we
cannot<00:01:35.220> hold<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.210> our<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.600> win<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
cannot hold out for our first win of the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
cannot hold out for our first win of the
earth<00:01:37.619> episode<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.400> far<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> series

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
earth episode so far all the series

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
earth episode so far all the series
which<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.079> disappointing<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.710> us<00:01:40.799> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
which is a little disappointing to us in

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.899 
which is a little disappointing to us in
the<00:01:41.310> second<00:01:41.810> our<00:01:42.810> second<00:01:43.229> season<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.399> think

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the second our second season but I think

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
the second our second season but I think
we<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.299> picking<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.630> i<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
we will be picking up i think it just it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
we will be picking up i think it just it
will<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.619> take<00:01:46.680> some<00:01:46.979> time<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> have

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
will just take some time but so to have

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
will just take some time but so to have
to<00:01:48.180> wait<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to wait and see how we get on in the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.350 
to wait and see how we get on in the
up-and-coming<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.430> future<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
up-and-coming a future but in the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.910 
up-and-coming a future but in the
90-minute<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:52.740> chance

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
90-minute do get a really good chance

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380 
90-minute do get a really good chance

good speed I think his shooting does let
him<00:04:18.900> down<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.020> little<00:04:19.200> bit<00:04:19.320> but<00:04:19.560> hopefully<00:04:20.100> that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
him down a little bit but hopefully that

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.250 
him down a little bit but hopefully that
will<00:04:20.580> go<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:20.940> as<00:04:21.060> his<00:04:21.299> ratings<00:04:21.660> do<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.020> up<00:04:22.049> as

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
will go up as his ratings do go up as

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.560 
will go up as his ratings do go up as
well<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.680> our<00:04:23.550> next<00:04:23.790> chance<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.360> game

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.840 
well and our next chance in the game

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
