show you and autofill from disk you can

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.560 
show you and autofill from disk you can
basically<00:06:04.750> just<00:06:05.700> make<00:06:06.700> it<00:06:06.820> small<00:06:07.270> enough<00:06:07.300> or

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
basically just make it small enough or

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.220 
basically just make it small enough or
big<00:06:07.750> enough<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.710> fit<00:06:09.010> the<00:06:09.160> disk<00:06:09.990> let's<00:06:10.990> see

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
big enough to fit the disk let's see

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.620 
big enough to fit the disk let's see
that's<00:06:12.220> just<00:06:12.430> loading<00:06:12.850> label<00:06:13.240> critter<00:06:13.480> could

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
that's just loading label critter could

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.780 
that's just loading label critter could
not<00:06:13.750> find<00:06:13.990> an<00:06:14.050> audio<00:06:14.290> CD<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:14.770> read<00:06:15.130> obviously

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
not find an audio CD to read obviously

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.870 
not find an audio CD to read obviously
but<00:06:16.390> so<00:06:16.990> basically<00:06:17.230> you<00:06:17.890> insert<00:06:18.370> your<00:06:18.580> disc

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
but so basically you insert your disc

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.230 
but so basically you insert your disc
and<00:06:19.260> it<00:06:20.260> can<00:06:20.500> then<00:06:20.800> fit<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.220> disc<00:06:21.700> to<00:06:22.090> your

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
and it can then fit the disc to your

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.600 
and it can then fit the disc to your
liking<00:06:22.660> like<00:06:23.440> without<00:06:23.650> even<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.340> have<00:06:24.580> to

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
liking like without even you have to

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.390 
liking like without even you have to
change<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.330> size<00:06:25.600> of<00:06:25.840> it<00:06:25.990> so<00:06:26.620> if<00:06:26.800> you<00:06:26.920> just<00:06:27.190> put

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
change the size of it so if you just put

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.660 
change the size of it so if you just put
in<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.670> regular<00:06:27.850> CD<00:06:28.360> you'll<00:06:29.050> match<00:06:29.830> that<00:06:30.100> if<00:06:30.460> you

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
in a regular CD you'll match that if you

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.040 
in a regular CD you'll match that if you
put<00:06:30.820> one<00:06:30.940> of<00:06:31.060> those<00:06:31.150> smaller<00:06:31.450> disc<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.990> you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
put one of those smaller disc that you

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.030
