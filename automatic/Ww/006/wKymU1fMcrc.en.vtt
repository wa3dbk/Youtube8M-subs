00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.290 
where the wires are slide in real easy
same<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.060> side<00:02:56.440> kind<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:58.300> how

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
same on this side kind of see it how

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.320 
same on this side kind of see it how
they<00:02:59.420> go<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:02.150> exit<00:03:02.540> right<00:03:02.750> here<00:03:04.330> nice

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
they go in and the exit right here nice

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.130 
they go in and the exit right here nice
bundle<00:03:06.280> wires<00:03:07.280> come<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.990> right<00:03:08.990> in<00:03:09.110> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
bundle wires come out right in the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.560 
bundle wires come out right in the
middle<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.640> risers<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:14.150> was<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> pain<00:03:14.540> to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
middle of the risers so it was a pain to

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.350 
middle of the risers so it was a pain to
get<00:03:14.870> them<00:03:14.990> wires<00:03:15.200> routed<00:03:15.470> but<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.150> takes

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
get them wires routed but it just takes

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.800 
get them wires routed but it just takes
a<00:03:17.450> little<00:03:17.600> time<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:19.070> lots<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.490> Lube<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.510> she<00:03:20.630> is

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
a little time and lots of Lube so she is

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.200 
a little time and lots of Lube so she is
heist<00:03:25.810> let's<00:03:26.810> take<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.050> easy
