planet Pluto this spacecraft a few years
back<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:18.600> passed<00:00:18.930> through<00:00:19.260> Jupiter<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.340> get

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
back when passed through Jupiter to get

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.910 
back when passed through Jupiter to get
a<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.820> bit<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> gravity<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.720> pool<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
a little bit of gravity a pool to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.490 
a little bit of gravity a pool to
increase<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> speed<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.170> there<00:00:25.170> was<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> good

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
increase the speed and there was a good

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259 
increase the speed and there was a good
opportunity<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.220> test<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> equipment<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
opportunity to test the equipment and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939 
opportunity to test the equipment and
the<00:00:27.359> cameras<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.019> got<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.289> nice<00:00:28.560> images

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the cameras and we got very nice images

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.030 
the cameras and we got very nice images
from<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.429> Jupiter<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.779> cameras<00:00:31.349> will

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
from from Jupiter so this cameras will

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.100 
from from Jupiter so this cameras will
resolve<00:00:33.649> details<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.280> 50<00:00:35.820> meters<00:00:36.110> only

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
resolve details to about 50 meters only

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920 
resolve details to about 50 meters only
in<00:00:37.320> size<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.370> surface<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> Pluto<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
in size on the surface of Pluto which is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
in size on the surface of Pluto which is
completely<00:00:40.620> unprecedented<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.670> see

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
completely unprecedented so we will see

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
completely unprecedented so we will see
perhaps<00:00:42.660> craters<00:00:43.170> perhaps<00:00:43.590> mountains<00:00:44.129> we

and<00:01:09.210> we're<00:01:09.299> seeing<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.540> lot<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> circular

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and we're seeing a lot of circular

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.870 
and we're seeing a lot of circular
things<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.860> we're<00:01:11.369> wondering<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.729> those

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
things that we're wondering are those

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
things that we're wondering are those
craters<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.260> something<00:01:13.320> else<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
craters or are they something else we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.399 
craters or are they something else we
saw<00:01:14.490> circular<00:01:14.820> features<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> Neptune's<00:01:16.140> moon

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
saw circular features on Neptune's moon

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.149 
saw circular features on Neptune's moon
Triton<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.490> craters<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> we

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
Triton that are not craters and so we

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
Triton that are not craters and so we
should<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.880> few<00:01:21.060> days<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.750> now

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
should know in a few days but right now

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.359 
should know in a few days but right now
we're<00:01:22.020> having<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.320> awful<00:01:22.740> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> fun<00:01:23.100> just

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
we're having an awful lot of fun just

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.660 
we're having an awful lot of fun just
really<00:01:24.500> speculating<00:01:25.500> after<00:01:26.100> flying<00:01:26.310> past
