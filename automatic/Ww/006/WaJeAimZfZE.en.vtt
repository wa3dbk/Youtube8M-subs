three solves that I had weren't all that
good<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.350> he<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.039> better<00:00:58.489> faster<00:00:59.750> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
good but then he got better faster the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.939 
good but then he got better faster the
last<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.140> that's<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> lot<00:01:01.920> of

last one that's when I have a lot of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
last one that's when I have a lot of
pressure<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.510> able<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> good

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
pressure but it was able to get a good

a twelve point five six average when I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
a twelve point five six average when I
realized<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> record<00:01:09.930> he<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.710> really

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
realized I had the record he was really

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.690 
realized I had the record he was really
awesome

have<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.119> students<00:01:24.630> understand<00:01:26.240> Antoine

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
have to my students understand Antoine

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
have to my students understand Antoine
understands<00:01:27.960> speed<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:29.880> him<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
understands speed so we put him to the
