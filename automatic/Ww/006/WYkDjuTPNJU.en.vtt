00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.149
 i 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello youtube people I am reach the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.969
 and in this new video tutorial they 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.420
 I will teach how to root your devices 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.640
 lg with android 5.0 lollipop 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 also in previous conversions of the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.779
 operating system since this tutorial 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.250
 will work for both devices 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 android 5.0 point 2 as for 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.500
 devices that have 4.2.2 or 4.4 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.210
 the method only works for phones 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.210
 lg as I mentioned earlier 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.040
 it's a simple way and I'm 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.590
 doing this tutorial because in a 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.820
 release tutor of what is LG 2 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.530
 of the spring company and many do not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.110
 it worked what was the method 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.629
 course then me in this tutorial 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.760
 I will teach you step by step what should 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.410
 do in my case I will do it with a lg 2 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 because you can have any 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.960
 LG device just have to prove it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.590
 I also want that if the method does not 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.950
 works at the first they should change what 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 what is 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.409
 the usb cable of the cell phone 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.869
 it happened to me that I did not want 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.179
 rootear the terminal does not install me when 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.789
 you want superuser but immediately 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.280
 change the usb cable so it was the 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.170
 original cell and brought 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.950
 immediately settled into the first 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.959
 also if you do not have the usb cable 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.909
 original you can use a usb cable 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.950
 original from another team not 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.350
 it necessarily has to be that of g2 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.810
 for the first step we will need 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 download what is this script that is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.960
 called the example is click script 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 for the first step we will need 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.539
 to download 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.079
 this folder that is called the example 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.299
 script version 1.2'll leave what 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.979
 a mega is hosted and the link is 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.200
 I will leave in the description of this video 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.680
 the second step will be to go to our 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.780
 finished and activate what is the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.500
 unknown origins that debugging 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 usb 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.200
 ok once being a certain one we're going 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.200
 to settings 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.690
 security 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.909
 and in this box the word more than 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.239
 says unknown origins let's 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.549
 accept and ready let's go back and let's what 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.830
 that is about the phone we are going to 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.920
 software information 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.380
 the build number or wii name if 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.750
 they have it in English we press seven 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.920
 times until you tell us that it is not 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.580
 necessary because you are already a 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.860
 developer 4 automatically tell us 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.510
 this message we can go back and see 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.410
 that has not appeared in what is this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.140
 option that says advanced options we give 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.050
 Click there 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.190
 and we give debug usb 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.240
 once 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.260
 'we have 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.080
 given already debug usb we proceed to 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.070
 connect what is the usb cable to 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.070
 our computer 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
 and we hope that the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.860
 drivers if it's the first time 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.120
 you introduce your device to what it is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.670
 and debugging does not look 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.980
 and you put it on the computer 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.980
 we open the folder the axis 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.260
 and we go here where it says 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.720
 ruth script a bat 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.120
 we click right 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.120
 and we run as administrator 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.360
 this interface and it will say that it is 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.330
 starting what is the server to dv 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.720
 will ask you what is a confirmation in 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.500
 the phone to which you will allow 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.570
 always and accept and automatically 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.570
 do the phone you will start 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.039
 we have left this message that says 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:30.260
 disconnect the usb cable from the computer and 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.990
 turn off your phone 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.200
 and you press the volume key up 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.100
 and to connect the usb cable to 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.930
 computer or is not asking that 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.970
 enter what is by way of classroom mode 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.360
 of scanner and for this simply 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.470
 pressed turn off certain 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.470
 disconnect the usb cable from the computer 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.150
 and once turned off we press volume 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.750
 up while we connect the usb cable 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.750
 to the computer 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.800
 the download mode will not exit 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.110
 and without moving what is the usb charge or 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.869
 touch the phone in no time the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.869
 process will continue totally south 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.650
 says that he is installing the script 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.440
 superuser that not wait for some 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.600
 minutes to be done correctly 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.300
 You left me the window because 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.460
 I already have superuser permissions 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.190
 but you will come out what is a 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.500
 number sign 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.530
 that is they are seeing right now 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.350
 on screen a number sign which 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.700
 it will indicate that they can disconnect 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.880
 what is your computer phone and 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.410
 pressing to turn it off completely 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.140
 pressing volume down the power to the 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.440
 once as for 10 or 15 seconds the 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.540
 phone will turn off 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.540
 once turned off we give you to learn 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:09.870
 and once turned on the terminal will tell us 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.759
 something like you're optimizing 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.960
 applications or an application that is the 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.960
 of the super user 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.620
 it's like well before the beginning of 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.419
 this video if this tutorial does not 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.639
 the first one works you have to change what 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.449
 is the cable hbo is to know and is the one 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.860
 is causing that not to be done 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.860
 the process correctly 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.210
 you can also use what is a 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.509
 original usb cable either from the terminal or 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.490
 original but from another firm osea htc 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:49.620
 samsung but that is original or what 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.600
 be one of those common cables 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.460
 but as I mentioned earlier this 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.129
 Bracelet tutorial also for all 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.559
 dispositives 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:01.039
 the axis containing what is android 

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:04.809
 5.0 or lower does not necessarily have 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.809
 that is axis 2 axis 3 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.200
 reflex you can try it on any 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.050
 lg terminal 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.030
