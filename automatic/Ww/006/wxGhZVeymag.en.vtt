00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 against Japan we know it will not be 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.280
 not easy his teammates who has a lot 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.019
 in life that is fighting a lot 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.179
 now we will be a mafia for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.210
 preparing the match is more important the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.650
 two days face to face Spain so 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.260
 the best way to prepare for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.210
 Spain is winning when Japan 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.520
 is to make a good match 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.570
 Spain is a great nation they have 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.000
 a player with with torres or if they 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 play without attacker with cesc fabregas 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 so that's it I think collectively 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.150
 it's still a very big nation with 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650
 players 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.740
 important who evolve in big 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.060
 European clubs I condemn and a nation 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.590
 in the world 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.900
 this is the canine league fouls 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.750
 from europe to the key 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.690
 in world cup so I think that's it 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.500
 these teams the team to beat 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.410
 at the international level that's a lot 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.220
 of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 for similarities with the FC Barcelona 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.589
 know his qualities 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.350
 here we know it's going to be a match 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.120
 very hard especially over there now we 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 have nothing to lose here is the 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.360
 matches 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.510
 super super good 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.340
 to live and play so that's all the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.280
 world everybody is motivated to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.200
 realize a machine a revenge to 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 take I do not know the euro it was a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.899
 different match in a compet 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 petitions finally it was different 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.610
 but it's more of a mini championship 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 a year after we play matches 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.439
 to win them we will go there for 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.000
 give the maximum and bring back some 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.210
 thing in France 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.520
 think it's very well played we saw 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 the euro that is the WHO 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
 often the ball position and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.420
 Basque must have learned a lot 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.900
 know that we have the ball but well 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.570
 come out try to keep this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 ball is likewise accounts 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.940
 so no I do not give up wearing 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.480
 I imagine the euro I think they have 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.520
 been stronger than us 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.010
 now it's up to us to show 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.140
 that we also have values and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.680
 and that we want to beat this 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.579
 team for our different solutions this 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.829
 game like as the girl chelsea joined 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.230
 very low or then put the pressing 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.870
 very high after both have some 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.670
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.620
 on the physical plane because when you 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.629
 defend nanterre our surface is going 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.569
 a lot of way to go 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.349
 to arrive in the opposing goal 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.760
 so that's after what physics the 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.980
 physical is not holding the whole match and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.230
 put a laundry up low it asks 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.239
 a lot of effort on the part of any 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.579
 the team to be well in block 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.870
 so after his hand who does the 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.480
 tactical it will be 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.080
 it will be the check mark but here it is 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.140
 difficult we know we have the beautiful slow 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.709
 if the hand in the position to go from 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.390
 kiki who play they have practically 60% 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.430
 possession possession plots 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.590
 so it's going to be hard to compete on this 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.099
 plane there but after with what and with 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.110
 commitment with a desire to fight 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.650
 for each other 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.650
 everything is possible
