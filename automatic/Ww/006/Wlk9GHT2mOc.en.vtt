00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
challenge to ultimately win practice and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670 
challenge to ultimately win practice and
that's<00:01:00.300> what's<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.469> might

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that's what's going to take there might

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
that's what's going to take there might
be<00:01:01.710> games<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.000> 13<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> 10<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.290> need

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
be games where it's 13 to 10 and we need

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
be games where it's 13 to 10 and we need
a<00:01:04.500> drive<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.339> offense<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> end<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a drive out of our offense at the end of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.160 
a drive out of our offense at the end of
the<00:01:06.270> game<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.689> might<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.140> been

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the game and it might not have been

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
the game and it might not have been
their<00:01:07.380> best<00:01:07.560> game<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.310> need<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> find<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> way

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
their best game they need to find a way

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
their best game they need to find a way
to<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.420> drive<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.110> critical

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
to get a drive at the most critical

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
to get a drive at the most critical
moment<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.760> played<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
moment so it really played into the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
moment so it really played into the
things<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> we've<00:01:13.110> been<00:01:13.290> talking<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.740> our

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
things that we've been talking about our

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
things that we've been talking about our
ability<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> finish<00:01:14.640> practice<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
ability to finish practice so that we

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.270 
ability to finish practice so that we
can<00:01:16.080> ultimately<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> finish<00:01:17.040> games

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
can ultimately go out and finish games

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.690 
can ultimately go out and finish games
so<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.110> cool<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.470> me

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
so that part was really cool for me

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.740 
so that part was really cool for me
another<00:01:20.700> part<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.360> cool<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.659> me

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
another part that was really cool for me

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
another part that was really cool for me

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
team for this week um you know that the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.090 
team for this week um you know that the
default<00:04:02.810> thing<00:04:03.260> was<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.440> big<00:04:03.650> deal<00:04:03.800> for<00:04:03.860> us

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
default thing was a big deal for us

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.790 
default thing was a big deal for us
today<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:05.300> it's<00:04:05.600> been<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.990> last<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.350> practice

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
today and it's been the last to practice

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.650 
today and it's been the last to practice
I<00:04:06.950> think<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.490> was<00:04:07.670> one<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.480> big

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
I think that that was one of the big

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.780 
I think that that was one of the big
ones<00:04:08.690> we<00:04:09.110> introduced<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.130> couple<00:04:10.430> different

know<00:04:28.220> obviously<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.850> work<00:04:29.090> for<00:04:29.270> Al<00:04:29.360> Davis<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
know obviously I work for Al Davis for a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.600 
know obviously I work for Al Davis for a
year<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.440> then<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.710> interviewed<00:04:31.100> with<00:04:31.220> him<00:04:31.370> at

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
year and then I interviewed with him at

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.100 
year and then I interviewed with him at
length<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.120> his<00:04:32.270> theory<00:04:32.600> was<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.050> should

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
length and his theory was you should

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.840 
length and his theory was you should
throw<00:04:33.380> too<00:04:33.440> deep<00:04:33.830> balls<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.160> quarter<00:04:34.430> which<00:04:34.670> is

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
throw too deep balls a quarter which is

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.140 
throw too deep balls a quarter which is
a<00:04:35.000> two-game<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.040> know<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.340> sounds<00:04:37.640> really

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
a two-game and I know that sounds really

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.000 
a two-game and I know that sounds really
simple<00:04:38.390> but<00:04:38.570> when<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.170> start<00:04:39.470> adding<00:04:39.650> that<00:04:39.830> up

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
simple but when you start adding that up

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.460 
simple but when you start adding that up
that's<00:04:40.250> eight<00:04:41.120> times<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.750> throw<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.320> ball

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
that's eight times you throw the ball

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.200 
that's eight times you throw the ball
beyond<00:04:42.920> 40<00:04:43.220> yards<00:04:43.520> down<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.700> field<00:04:43.850> that

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
beyond 40 yards down the field that

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.550 
beyond 40 yards down the field that
makes<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.510> defense<00:04:44.900> whether<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.200> complete

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
makes a defense whether you complete

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.010 
makes a defense whether you complete
them<00:04:45.650> or<00:04:45.770> not<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.580> makes<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.880> defense<00:04:47.270> weary

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
them or not that makes a defense weary

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.260 
them or not that makes a defense weary
of<00:04:48.290> man<00:04:48.920> i<00:04:48.950> might<00:04:49.250> get<00:04:49.430> beat<00:04:49.670> deep<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.150> that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
of man i might get beat deep and that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.850 
of man i might get beat deep and that
generally<00:04:50.780> makes<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.170> lot<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.530> things<00:04:51.770> that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
generally makes a lot of the things that

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.250 
generally makes a lot of the things that
are<00:04:52.010> neath<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.340> little<00:04:52.580> bit<00:04:52.700> easier<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.270> you

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
are neath a little bit easier so you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.200 
are neath a little bit easier so you
know<00:04:54.320> we<00:04:54.440> don't<00:04:54.560> hold<00:04:54.950> pardon<00:04:55.610> fast<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.180> that

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
know we don't hold pardon fast to that

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.330 
know we don't hold pardon fast to that
number<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.230> an<00:04:57.410> easy<00:04:57.560> number<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.100> kind

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
number but it is an easy number to kind
