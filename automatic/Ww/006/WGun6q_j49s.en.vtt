exaction metal you got the remote here
which<00:00:50.600> for<00:00:50.780> some<00:00:50.929> reason<00:00:50.989> is<00:00:51.350> upside<00:00:51.649> down<00:00:51.679> and

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
which for some reason is upside down and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.099 
which for some reason is upside down and
that's<00:00:53.210> pretty<00:00:53.390> much<00:00:53.479> it<00:00:53.569> for<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.809> front<00:00:54.019> of

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
that's pretty much it for the front of

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.950 
that's pretty much it for the front of
the<00:00:54.199> box<00:00:54.760> go<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:55.969> back<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:56.659> can<00:00:56.690> see<00:00:56.839> all

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
the box go to the back you can see all

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.399 
the box go to the back you can see all
the<00:00:57.199> different<00:00:57.289> specs<00:00:58.039> oak<00:00:58.219> lots<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.519> 10<00:00:58.729> hertz

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
the different specs oak lots of 10 hertz

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.959 
the different specs oak lots of 10 hertz
24,000<00:01:00.409> hurt<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:00.679> that<00:01:00.800> means<00:01:01.039> cut<00:01:01.699> quite<00:01:01.909> a

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
24,000 hurt so that means cut quite a

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.149 
24,000 hurt so that means cut quite a
low<00:01:02.210> frequency<00:01:02.409> response<00:01:03.409> which<00:01:03.620> means<00:01:03.829> they

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
low frequency response which means they

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.340 
low frequency response which means they
should<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:04.460> good<00:01:04.640> bass<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.210> quite<00:01:05.869> good

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
should have good bass and quite good

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.990 
should have good bass and quite good
highs<00:01:06.560> as<00:01:06.799> well<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.549> know<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.729> should<00:01:07.909> be

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
highs as well so you know it should be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.330 
highs as well so you know it should be
good<00:01:08.270> all<00:01:08.450> over<00:01:08.560> then<00:01:09.560> you've<00:01:09.950> got<00:01:10.040> 30

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
good all over then you've got 30

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.539 
good all over then you've got 30
millimeter<00:01:10.790> drivers<00:01:11.860> you've<00:01:12.860> got<00:01:13.009> your<00:01:13.100> you

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
millimeter drivers you've got your you

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.639 
millimeter drivers you've got your you
know<00:01:13.640> different<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.509> got<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.719> 1.2<00:01:15.409> meter

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
know different you got the 1.2 meter

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.100 
know different you got the 1.2 meter
cable<00:01:16.039> here<00:01:16.460> you've<00:01:17.420> got<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.630> instruction<00:01:18.049> at

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
cable here you've got the instruction at

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.359 
cable here you've got the instruction at
the<00:01:18.170> top<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.530> how<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.710> actually<00:01:19.039> use<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the top and how to actually use the

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.980 
the top and how to actually use the
remote<00:01:19.640> what<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.939> differences<00:01:20.509> are<00:01:20.659> but<00:01:20.869> I

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
remote what the differences are but I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.330 
remote what the differences are but I
think<00:01:21.259> most<00:01:21.439> people<00:01:21.710> will<00:01:21.829> know<00:01:21.950> by<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:22.310> how

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
think most people will know by now how

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.090 
think most people will know by now how
the<00:01:22.640> remote<00:01:23.030> works<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:24.649> that's<00:01:24.829> pretty<00:01:25.009> much

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the remote works and that's pretty much

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.399 
the remote works and that's pretty much
it<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.700> box<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.630> we'll<00:01:26.840> get<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.049> open

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
it for the box so we'll get this open

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.920 
it for the box so we'll get this open
and<00:01:27.530> see<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:27.770> comes<00:01:27.950> inside<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.689> open

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
and see what comes inside so to open

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.060 
and see what comes inside so to open
this<00:01:29.990> box<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:30.469> looks<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.799> simply

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
this box it just looks like you simply

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.569 
this box it just looks like you simply
pull<00:01:31.280> these<00:01:31.460> two<00:01:31.640> tabs<00:01:31.939> up<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:34.460> then

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
pull these two tabs up and now and then

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.999 
pull these two tabs up and now and then
put<00:01:34.729> let's<00:01:34.880> get<00:01:35.030> rid<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.619> sort<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.710> paper

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
put let's get rid of this sort of paper

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.670 
put let's get rid of this sort of paper
back<00:01:37.310> here<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.840> then<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.140> can<00:01:39.289> see<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.590> got

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
back here and then you can see you got

actual view of these headphones so to

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.570 
actual view of these headphones so to
start<00:04:28.720> off<00:04:28.810> with<00:04:28.990> um<00:04:29.320> I<00:04:29.680> didn't<00:04:30.190> actually<00:04:30.310> show

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
start off with um I didn't actually show

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.670 
start off with um I didn't actually show
what<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.139> headband<00:04:32.139> looked<00:04:32.320> out<00:04:32.440> when<00:04:32.560> you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
what the headband looked out when you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.960 
what the headband looked out when you
extend<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.280> you've<00:04:33.400> got<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> sort<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.850> that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
extend it so you've got the sort of that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.400 
extend it so you've got the sort of that
dotted<00:04:34.360> pattern<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:34.810> which<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.020> really<00:04:35.199> nice

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
dotted pattern here which is really nice

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.379 
dotted pattern here which is really nice
so<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.250> don't<00:04:36.520> get<00:04:36.669> any<00:04:36.820> sort<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.060> different

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.659 
so you don't get any sort of different
color<00:04:37.600> coming<00:04:37.930> out<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.550> obviously<00:04:39.550> it's

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
color coming out of it obviously it's

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.189 
color coming out of it obviously it's
plastic<00:04:40.090> inside<00:04:40.360> as<00:04:40.479> well<00:04:40.510> as<00:04:40.690> non<00:04:40.840> metal

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
plastic inside as well as non metal

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.770 
plastic inside as well as non metal

even walk suppress down your head if you

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.659

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
you do get the slide but if you put the

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.950 
you do get the slide but if you put the
musical<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.789> know<00:05:30.880> really<00:05:31.150> high<00:05:31.389> to<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.720> max

these for listening on the bus with or

these for listening on the bus with or
anything<00:05:36.669> like<00:05:36.729> that<00:05:36.820> you'll<00:05:37.389> be<00:05:37.510> perfectly

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
anything like that you'll be perfectly

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.980 
anything like that you'll be perfectly
fine<00:05:37.960> no<00:05:38.470> belt<00:05:38.740> here<00:05:39.010> around<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.870> you<00:05:40.870> know

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
fine no belt here around you you know

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.290 
fine no belt here around you you know
they<00:05:41.110> don't<00:05:41.229> leak<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:42.370> much<00:05:42.610> at<00:05:42.820> all<00:05:42.849> along

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
they don't leak that much at all along

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.960 
they don't leak that much at all along
 is<00:05:43.660> not<00:05:43.810> appropriate<00:05:43.870> volume<00:05:44.669> so<00:05:45.669> if<00:05:45.849> you

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
 is not appropriate volume so if you

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.969 
 is not appropriate volume so if you
look<00:05:46.090> at<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.780> microphone<00:05:47.320> that<00:05:47.770> worked

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
look at the microphone that worked

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.350 
look at the microphone that worked
really<00:05:48.160> well<00:05:48.400> as<00:05:48.639> well<00:05:48.820> you<00:05:48.970> know<00:05:49.060> just<00:05:49.300> like

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
really well as well you know just like

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760 
really well as well you know just like
as<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.630> expected<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.169> microphones<00:05:50.560> really

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
as you expected the microphones really

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.430 
as you expected the microphones really
really<00:05:51.160> clear<00:05:51.449> the<00:05:52.449> controls<00:05:52.810> work<00:05:53.050> just<00:05:53.289> this

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
really clear the controls work just this

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.230 
really clear the controls work just this
should<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:53.979> pretty<00:05:54.400> much<00:05:54.460> everything<00:05:55.000> worked

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
should I pretty much everything worked

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.129 
should I pretty much everything worked
normally<00:05:56.050> in<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.710> sense<00:05:57.449> so<00:05:58.449> we<00:05:58.599> now<00:05:58.750> go<00:05:59.110> to

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
normally in that sense so we now go to

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.510 
normally in that sense so we now go to
the<00:05:59.320> review<00:05:59.620> of<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.770> actual<00:05:59.949> headphones<00:06:00.310> what

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
the review of the actual headphones what

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.540 
the review of the actual headphones what
they<00:06:00.610> sound<00:06:00.849> like<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.680> found<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.889> even<00:06:03.280> though

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
they sound like I found that even though

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.100 
they sound like I found that even though
it's<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:04.120> know<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.240> box<00:06:04.479> stations<00:06:04.870> should<00:06:04.990> go

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
it's you know the box stations should go

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.170 
it's you know the box stations should go
out<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.320> 10<00:06:05.530> Hertz<00:06:05.919> which<00:06:06.130> means<00:06:06.520> really<00:06:06.970> low

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
out to 10 Hertz which means really low

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.779 
out to 10 Hertz which means really low
base<00:06:07.539> normally<00:06:07.990> you<00:06:08.169> know<00:06:08.830> 10<00:06:09.280> Hertz<00:06:09.520> means

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
base normally you know 10 Hertz means

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.450 
base normally you know 10 Hertz means
you<00:06:09.940> get<00:06:10.150> like<00:06:10.389> amazing<00:06:10.900> bass<00:06:11.320> you<00:06:12.160> couldn't

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
you get like amazing bass you couldn't

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.860 
you get like amazing bass you couldn't
really<00:06:12.580> feel<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:12.910> bass<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.570> I<00:06:13.599> think<00:06:13.780> that

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
really feel that bass and I think that

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.629 
really feel that bass and I think that
was<00:06:13.960> down<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.320> the<00:06:14.440> 30<00:06:14.710> millimeter<00:06:15.190> drivers

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
was down to the 30 millimeter drivers

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.370 
was down to the 30 millimeter drivers
not<00:06:15.880> having<00:06:16.120> less<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.270> 40<00:06:16.750> or<00:06:16.810> 50<00:06:17.050> millimeter

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
not having less a 40 or 50 millimeter

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.589 
not having less a 40 or 50 millimeter
drivers<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.729> can<00:06:18.760> sort<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:19.090> hear<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.419> bass

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
drivers you can sort of hear the bass

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.000 
drivers you can sort of hear the bass
but<00:06:19.870> you<00:06:19.960> couldn't<00:06:20.169> really<00:06:20.349> feel<00:06:20.680> it<00:06:20.919> you

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
but you couldn't really feel it you

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.890 
but you couldn't really feel it you
can't<00:06:21.190> really<00:06:21.310> feel<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.639> punch<00:06:21.820> of<00:06:22.030> it<00:06:22.180> the

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
can't really feel the punch of it the

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.689 
can't really feel the punch of it the
heisman<00:06:23.380> that<00:06:23.500> I<00:06:23.560> had<00:06:23.710> were<00:06:23.919> really<00:06:24.250> good<00:06:24.460> but

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
heisman that I had were really good but
