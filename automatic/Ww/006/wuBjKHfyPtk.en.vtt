let's<00:02:47.500> take<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> peek<00:02:47.860> under<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.130> hood<00:02:48.220> because

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
let's take a peek under the hood because

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.949 
let's take a peek under the hood because
this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.820> really<00:02:49.030> where<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:49.420> car<00:02:49.690> shines

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
this is really where this car shines

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.600 
this is really where this car shines
keep<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.410> mind<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:50.680> talked<00:02:50.890> about<00:02:51.040> push<00:02:51.340> rods

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
keep in mind we talked about push rods

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.240 
keep in mind we talked about push rods

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
instead of quad overhead cams and things

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.670

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
like that GM is still able to crank out

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
this is a real-deal 405 horsepower which

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.000
