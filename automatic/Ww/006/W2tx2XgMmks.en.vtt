00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.230
 Dear professionals in training 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.069
 within the accounting or accounting component is very 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.269
 important what the source documentation means. 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.909
 The documents is the justification for all transactions carried out by 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.880
 the company and the essential element for the accounting record 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.310
 they are an integral and verifiable proof by third parties as 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.359
 you know 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.019
 the accounting process always culminates with the elaboration of the states 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.930
 financial and information that we present in them 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.860
 You must have your backup test 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.570
 for that is the source documentation, we can not make any record that does not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.960
 have the respective support; 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 between the source documentation we can mention invoices, sales notes 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.200
 liquidation of purchase of goods or provision of services, documentation 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.380
 internal that can be the roles of payment, bills of exchange, promissory notes. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.890
 Currently the internal revenue service has a regulation of how 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 we must justify the transactions 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.910
 and that is carried out according to the current sales receipts between the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.990
 which we have the invoices 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.250
 the sales notes, the liquidation of purchase of goods and provision of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.100
 services 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 tickets issued by cash registers, tickets to tickets or 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.170
 Public shows 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.220
 and other documents authorized in this regulation 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.500
 This regulation can be obtained by entering the web page 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.590
 of the internal revenue service there can review it in its entirety 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.600
 It is vitally important to know that the bills serve us or are intended 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.940
 so that we use them the societies and natural persons that we are obliged to 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.510
 to keep accounting 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.710
 and that we have to use the tax credit. 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.110
 Currently the sales notes are only for those taxpayers that the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.690
 internal revenue service has qualified them under this RISE system 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.759
 Other complementary documents that are important to support 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.849
 The costs and expenses within the accounting are: the credit notes 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.479
 Debit notes and referral guidelines 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.799
 Credit notes are issued to cancel operations, accept returns 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.429
 and grant discounts or bonuses 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:20.300
 at present when we want to grant a discount to a 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.319
 invoice that has already been given 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.310
 and that suddenly the initial conditions went to credit and then we 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.019
 paid in cash we would have to use a credit note to 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.049
 be able to grant that discount 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.809
 Also when a return is made, we have to use a 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:36.950
 Credit note 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.259
 that obviously affects the invoice that was originally issued 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.679
 debit notes are used for the matter of charging interest for arrears and 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.600
 to recover certain costs or expenses incurred by the seller 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:55.159
 but after the issuance of the initial voucher that would be the invoice 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.809
 The referral guides are documents that the internal revenue service has 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.029
 regulated so that they support the transfer of merchandise within the territory 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:07.689
 national, when we have to move our products through 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.079
 of sales that we make outside the locality; obviously we have to have 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.449
 these documents that justify their transfer that are the guides of 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.549
 remission 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.370
 Another important document is also the withholding vouchers that are 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.889
 those documents that certify 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.469
 the withholding of taxes made by agents according to the regime law 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.509
 internal tax if we have a withholding tax on the 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.080
 rent 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.400
 This is the document that supports this retention and if at any time 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.280
 our income has not exceeded the base established by the service of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.389
 internal rents 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.589
 With these documents we can analyze the return 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.049
 or compensate at the company level 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.689
 the anticipated tax that we have had when we have to liquidate the 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.149
 Income tax 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.459
 those documents that will allow us to sustain the credit 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.609
 tributary are 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.279
 the invoices, the liquidation of the purchase of goods and the rendering of services and 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.489
 other authorized documents that are regulated in the regulation 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.229
 this is going to do or we can sustain the tax credit apart from having the 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.279
 proof of sale as long as you identify yourself so much 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.099
 to the buyer through his RUC 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.059
 and we also have the other form or regulation that those documents that do not 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.809
 support tax credit, but if they serve to sustain costs and 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:26.719
 expenses 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.900
 because we have to have the proof that they have been 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.330
 acquired or that we have acquired goods and services and that they have to be 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.919
 preprinted and pre-enumerated those documents that are not 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.439
 to support tax credit, but if they are authorized 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.059
 for the service of internal rents they will serve us to sustain costs and 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.419
 expenses, otherwise a document that does not regulate those requirements 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.269
 pre-established, they are not going to affect us and they are practically going to be 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:57.729
 deductible for when we have to do the calculation of income tax 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.729
 inside other important source documents we have the documents 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.620
 banking which in this case refers to all those documents that are 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.529
 issued 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.569
 by the bank among which we can mention the check, the notes of 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.169
 bank deposit, savings account withdrawal notes, statement of account 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.309
 current, the bank debit and bank credit note. 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.989
 And among the commercial documents that are currently still in force 

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.059
 we talk about what it is 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.800
 to mark an obligation or an operation within a transaction the 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:28.909
 bill of exchange 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.779
 and the promissory note to the order. 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.559
 Thank you for your kind attention
