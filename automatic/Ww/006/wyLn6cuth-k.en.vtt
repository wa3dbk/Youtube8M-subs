00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.130
 in the following short film we will 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.250
 give them the different steps 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.930
 the lawn regeneration show off since 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.970
 many years the company becker is beside 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.760
 the garden and landscaping also in 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.160
 Sportplatzbau active the professional 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.730
 dealing with the sensitive green requires 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.890
 Sensitivity and competent experience 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.890
 our range of services includes the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.569
 new construction the professional care the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.200
 regeneration and renovation 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.670
 all sport surfaces such as grass 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.120
 artificial grass plastic slips and tarmac 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.120
 areas 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 place for through training and play 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.330
 one often recognizes that the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.790
 goal and midfield area strong 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.950
 is played by different 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.840
 measures, we can the company becker 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.370
 to help her race again a dense 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.930
 train grass 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.930
 This happens in several steps 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.019
 first the lawn is trimmed so that the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.019
 green area can be edited 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.900
 to scarify that 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 by dead plant parts with the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.590
 time of a multi-layered 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.900
 soil surface forms the negative 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.720
 affects the development of the lawn 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.170
 Must be at regular intervals 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.420
 be removed 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.710
 the felt harms your lawn and inhibits 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.480
 him in his development 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.790
 This is the floor air exchange 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.830
 No more water can not be given 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.540
 in the root area that win 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.480
 Root growth is reduced 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.590
 the raging loses its strength 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.240
 and fungal infections are promoted 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.290
 Here you can see how the vils 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.300
 carpet is disposed of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.270
 Now the turf is in a position again 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 free to breathe a good root space too 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.810
 form and the player a good one 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.810
 to provide stability in the field 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.619
 that existed 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.940
 the next step is the whole of the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.520
 lawn 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.650
 In this scene you can see a sand 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.990
 a sand is loaded with one 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.310
 optimal grain structure around the sports field 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 improve substrate 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 the hand gave for a sports field of 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.880
 7000 square meters amount to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.090
 cut to 6 to 8 liters per 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.090
 square meters 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 with this device the sand are reported 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.110
 manually adjustable so that the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.160
 individual needs of the place 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.410
 to be fair by 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.000
 evenly applying the sand 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.790
 the permeability to water and air 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.400
 get in the upper ground horizon or 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.490
 improves windy and humic soils 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.990
 will shift place bumps 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.990
 can be compensated 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.320
 reduce that 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.950
 another step towards improvement 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.050
 your lawn that efficiently that he 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.520
 evi zieren relaxes the floor and 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 makes room for air 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.690
 the near-surface soil compaction the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.150
 characterized by high player haunting 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.340
 is reinforced to a depth of 20 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.170
 centimeters relaxed in this 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.600
 sequence can be recognized as the spoon 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.450
 bend metal rods the so-called 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.260
 slightly raise the grass hub and spoons 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 at the same time lighten up 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 Likewise, unevenness of the place 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.940
 with the setting of the boom break 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.490
 angle compensated by the 1 meter 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 80 wide brooms with sand at the same time 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.800
 in the now existing holes 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.290
 incorporated 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.300
 This happens at the bottom of the breathing 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.880
 substrates by a meanwhile 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.880
 to promote optimal grain texture 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.910
 the seeding 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.980
 to play 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.720
 the lawn especially the tour and 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.200
 Close midfield area again 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.760
 a seeding is necessary here 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.460
 about ten millimeters deep holes 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.900
 engraved around the seed reliably in the 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.200
 ground to incorporate 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.610
 with such a deep enough by 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.890
 Regeneration seed becomes the grass seed 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.959
 close again and thus one 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.959
 smooth game play 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.980
 now have the right one with us 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.660
 Selection of regeneration measures 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.610
 their place is matched by 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.530
 our fresh cell soon from his 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.240
 can present the most beautiful side and 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 at the same time a professional 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.020
 Guarantee the game 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.180
 just sit down with us 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.180
 connection we are happy to advise you
