00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.030 

so<00:01:22.520> they're<00:01:22.670> yearlings<00:01:23.240> right<00:01:23.479> now

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.810

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.170 

here's<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.670> mail

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:09.770 

he<00:01:58.780> has<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.900> bit<00:01:59.230> more<00:01:59.470> red<00:01:59.800> on<00:02:00.100> him

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.160 

really<00:02:10.500> nice-looking

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.500 

when<00:02:17.680> he's<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> yearling<00:02:18.460> also<00:02:18.850> 2011<00:02:21.510> also

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
when he's a yearling also 2011 also

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.280 
when he's a yearling also 2011 also
produced<00:02:22.870> by<00:02:23.110> Scott<00:02:23.650> pally<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.050> are

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
produced by Scott pally but they are

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.200 
produced by Scott pally but they are
from<00:02:26.560> different<00:02:26.740> clutches<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.520> am<00:02:27.700> related

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.190 

so<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> plus

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so is a plus

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800 
so is a plus
the<00:02:33.740> others<00:02:34.069> uh<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.640> don't<00:02:35.420> know<00:02:35.600> any

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the others uh I don't know any

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.590 
the others uh I don't know any
information<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> locality<00:02:37.600> apparently

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
information on the locality apparently

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.570 
information on the locality apparently
they've<00:02:38.780> been<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.319> know<00:02:39.440> bred<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.069> much<00:02:40.280> out

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
they've been you know bred so much out

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.610 
they've been you know bred so much out
of<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.000> original<00:02:41.330> pair<00:02:42.110> from<00:02:42.380> whatever

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
of that original pair from whatever

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.059 
of that original pair from whatever
locality<00:02:43.400> he<00:02:43.580> said<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.770> know<00:02:45.890> he

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
locality he said that you know he

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.800 
locality he said that you know he
doesn't<00:02:46.400> feel<00:02:46.700> comfortable<00:02:46.810> considering

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
doesn't feel comfortable considering

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.720 
doesn't feel comfortable considering
them<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.020> certain<00:02:48.530> locality<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.190> guess<00:02:49.490> they've

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
them a certain locality I guess they've

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.030 
them a certain locality I guess they've
also<00:02:49.970> probably<00:02:50.570> been<00:02:50.750> crossbred<00:02:51.440> quite<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.770> bit

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
also probably been crossbred quite a bit

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.980 
also probably been crossbred quite a bit
you<00:02:52.610> know<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.500> they're<00:02:54.500> probably<00:02:54.770> not<00:02:55.990> pure

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
you know so they're probably not pure

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.400 
you know so they're probably not pure
one<00:02:57.260> locality<00:02:57.709> at<00:02:58.010> all<00:02:58.160> anymore<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:02.410> I'm

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
one locality at all anymore but I'm

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.740 
one locality at all anymore but I'm
still<00:03:03.800> very<00:03:03.950> happy<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.580> them<00:03:04.790> really<00:03:05.420> liked

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
still very happy with them really liked

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.600 
still very happy with them really liked
them

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.010 

really<00:03:12.390> cool<00:03:12.600> he's<00:03:13.050> uh<00:03:13.700> also<00:03:14.700> need<00:03:15.120> cooler

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
really cool he's uh also need cooler

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
really cool he's uh also need cooler
temperatures<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.160> bamboo<00:03:17.580> rat

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
temperatures a lot like my bamboo rat

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.050 
temperatures a lot like my bamboo rat
snakes<00:03:18.210> over<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:19.580> they're<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.610> little<00:03:20.790> bit

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
snakes over there they're a little bit

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.120 
snakes over there they're a little bit
better<00:03:22.050> about<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.440> they're<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.710> little<00:03:22.950> more

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
better about it they're a little more

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.490 
better about it they're a little more
tolerant<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.300> little<00:03:25.170> bit<00:03:25.320> higher

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
tolerant of a little bit higher

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.220 
tolerant of a little bit higher
temperatures<00:03:26.160> than<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.760> like<00:03:27.510> coxy<00:03:28.080> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.780

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
still need a cooler temperatures so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.340 
still need a cooler temperatures so
right<00:03:39.120> now<00:03:39.270> I'm<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.570> keeping<00:03:39.960> them<00:03:40.080> at<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
right now I'm just keeping them at a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.010 
right now I'm just keeping them at a
room<00:03:40.920> temperature<00:03:41.900> no<00:03:42.900> extra<00:03:43.320> heating<00:03:43.610> and

room temperature no extra heating and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.220 
room temperature no extra heating and
they're<00:03:46.020> doing<00:03:46.380> well<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:51.230> they're

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
they're doing well but they're

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.750 
they're doing well but they're
definitely<00:03:52.950> really<00:03:53.730> nice-looking<00:03:53.940> animals

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
definitely really nice-looking animals

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.520 
definitely really nice-looking animals
one<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.940> more<00:03:57.060> popular<00:03:57.300> ones<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.050> guess<00:03:58.260> I'd

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
one of the more popular ones I guess I'd

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
one of the more popular ones I guess I'd
