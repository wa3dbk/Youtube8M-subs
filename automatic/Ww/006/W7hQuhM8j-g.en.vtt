00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.719
 the majority of Venezuelan specimens 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.520
 and Panamanians present in Puerto Rico 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.559
 for the equestrian series of the Caribbean 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.300
 presented on Monday to the track 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.820
 main of the hippodrome waiter to his 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.859
 first day of training 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.720
 first they walked several minutes in the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.210
 quarantine area before undertaking 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.100
 way to the track guarded by 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.310
 staff that produces in quarantine 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.830
 federal all saw themselves in very good 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.870
 condition while galloping and treating 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.390
 soft on the ground looking for 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.239
 recover conditions after a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.399
 quarantine that lasted seven days the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.590
 trainer rafa fernandez who presents 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.690
 five copies in the equestrian series we 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.309
 commented on how his pupils were seen 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.520
 the first day it's always normal that 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.079
 go for a smooth jog but in terminals 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.340
 but pretty good most I had 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.660
 one of the horses that we have climbed that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.130
 we see there 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.380
 the horse knew against heavy the 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.290
 Sunday in the manger yesterday the doctor 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.760
 Garcia the angel treated him and today he walks 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.130
 assembled only tomorrow we have to 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.660
 sweat the track we think it's something 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.700
 passenger apparently everything seems 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.440
 yes it would be enough in front of the horses 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 snacks themselves up jogging 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.490
 only the track was missed 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.590
 a little hard for him but good to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.229
 As you go up the track 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.580
 Gallop is going to adapt from the others 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.410
 splendid horses themselves did well 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.630
 with Orion he did well he faces 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.400
 the baixo well and so let's continue soft 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.740
 for several days to see later the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.840
 another week if we make a decision if 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 we give some student to the injured we're going 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 letting go as we say here in the arch 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.530
 typical the case of boza since it tells me 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.690
 that had a counterweight an expression that 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.009
 uses aces and in the manger 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.450
 apparently at dawn of Sunday in 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.480
 the morning you had to knee a little 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.340
 inflamed a little liquid 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.880
 and they took out the synovial fluid but 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 taking x-rays there's nothing 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.570
 nothing serious as we say are risks of the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 trade and it seems that everything will turn out well 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 so we're putting our hands together like 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.149
 says in a usual situation in him or in 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.740
 the first time it happens as saint or 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.659
 I already had that problem before but 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 we're used to but that's going to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.550
 keep going is already the second time that 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.410
 try to eat 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.740
 ah 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.740
 ah
