00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
a little unfortunate for fly if he'd

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.619 
a little unfortunate for fly if he'd

hadn't been there okay I mean does a lot
of<00:01:05.339> ifs<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.570> he<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.840> taken

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of ifs but I think he would have taken

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
of ifs but I think he would have taken
down<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> optimistic<00:01:07.590> died<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.369> quickly<00:01:08.510> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
down the optimistic died so quickly to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.840 
down the optimistic died so quickly to
that<00:01:09.689> blade<00:01:09.900> master<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.610> mean

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that blade master which is just I mean

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.340 
that blade master which is just I mean
it<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.510> powerful<00:01:12.810> hero<00:01:13.220> there's

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
it is the more powerful hero there's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.719 
it is the more powerful hero there's
Alchemist<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.409> quite<00:01:16.650> weak<00:01:16.890> there's<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.490> reason

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
Alchemist is quite weak there's a reason

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.950 
Alchemist is quite weak there's a reason
that<00:01:17.880> people<00:01:18.090> didn't<00:01:18.390> use<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> long

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that people didn't use it for a long

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.149 
that people didn't use it for a long
time<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> does<00:01:19.860> very

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
time and that's because it does very

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
time and that's because it does very
easily<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.780> hero

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
easily you don't want to have your hero

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
easily you don't want to have your hero
that<00:01:22.170> does<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.500> easily<00:01:22.710> using<00:01:23.150> while<00:01:24.150> you're

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that does very easily using while you're

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.039 
that does very easily using while you're

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.830 
to get on the back foot against this
Alchemist<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.269> maybe<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.599> more<00:02:19.660> effective

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
Alchemist so maybe it's more effective

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.380 
Alchemist so maybe it's more effective
than<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.170> thought<00:02:20.849> talents<00:02:21.849> with<00:02:21.970> alchemist

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
than I thought talents with alchemist

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.000 
than I thought talents with alchemist
second<00:02:22.720> who<00:02:22.780> would<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.019> thought<00:02:23.140> we'll<00:02:23.830> see

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
second who would have thought we'll see

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.729 
second who would have thought we'll see
how<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.190> works<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.560> long<00:02:26.709> run

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
how this works out in the long run

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.580 
how this works out in the long run
though<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.220> fly<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.080> beginning<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.319> sort

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
though as fly is now beginning to sort

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.740 
though as fly is now beginning to sort
of<00:02:29.650> test<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.190> strength<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.299> strategy<00:02:31.630> by

the<00:06:53.939> alchemist<00:06:54.360> when<00:06:54.479> it's<00:06:54.599> dad<00:06:54.750> is<00:06:54.870> just<00:06:54.990> dead

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
the alchemist when it's dad is just dead

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:56.990 
the alchemist when it's dad is just dead
the<00:06:55.830> Beast<00:06:56.039> Master<00:06:56.340> has<00:06:56.490> quill<00:06:56.699> beats<00:06:56.849> the

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
the Beast Master has quill beats the

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.100 
the Beast Master has quill beats the
last<00:06:57.180> for<00:06:57.330> 70<00:06:57.569> seconds<00:06:57.840> or<00:06:57.960> whatever<00:06:58.080> so<00:07:00.110> yeah

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
last for 70 seconds or whatever so yeah

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.559 
last for 70 seconds or whatever so yeah
I'm<00:07:01.800> not<00:07:02.189> sure<00:07:02.340> I'm<00:07:02.490> really<00:07:03.000> not<00:07:03.150> sure<00:07:03.210> what

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
I'm not sure I'm really not sure what

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.170 
I'm not sure I'm really not sure what
the<00:07:03.779> what<00:07:04.050> that<00:07:04.199> the<00:07:04.620> theory<00:07:05.460> craft<00:07:05.759> behind<00:07:05.939> it

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
the what that the theory craft behind it

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.980 
the what that the theory craft behind it
is<00:07:06.620> I<00:07:07.909> think<00:07:08.909> it<00:07:09.120> remains<00:07:09.240> to<00:07:09.479> be<00:07:09.539> seen<00:07:09.599> whether

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
is I think it remains to be seen whether

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.420 
is I think it remains to be seen whether
the<00:07:10.110> strategy<00:07:10.529> is<00:07:10.560> going<00:07:10.919> to<00:07:11.009> be<00:07:11.069> effective

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
the strategy is going to be effective

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.740 
the strategy is going to be effective
this<00:07:11.520> is<00:07:11.669> twisted<00:07:12.000> Meadows<00:07:12.240> it's<00:07:12.389> not<00:07:12.569> the

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
this is twisted Meadows it's not the

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.899 
this is twisted Meadows it's not the
best<00:07:12.840> talent<00:07:13.080> map<00:07:16.310> try<00:07:17.310> the<00:07:17.370> Alpha<00:07:17.639> missed<00:07:17.789> on

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:17.909 
best talent map try the Alpha missed on

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:19.519 
best talent map try the Alpha missed on
echo<00:07:18.000> isles<00:07:18.240> and<00:07:18.539> maybe<00:07:19.080> we'll<00:07:19.259> get<00:07:19.349> a<00:07:19.409> better

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:19.529 
echo isles and maybe we'll get a better

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:24.200 
echo isles and maybe we'll get a better
idea<00:07:19.650> of<00:07:20.300> how<00:07:21.300> it<00:07:21.479> works<00:07:22.039> anyway<00:07:23.039> that's<00:07:23.969> the

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
idea of how it works anyway that's the

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.629 
idea of how it works anyway that's the
end<00:07:24.449> of<00:07:24.599> Game<00:07:24.779> three<00:07:25.139> we're<00:07:26.039> on<00:07:26.189> three<00:07:26.430> right

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
end of Game three we're on three right

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.439 
end of Game three we're on three right
yeah<00:07:26.939> so<00:07:27.949> that<00:07:28.949> means<00:07:29.250> that<00:07:29.520> mouse<00:07:30.000> takes<00:07:30.270> this

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
yeah so that means that mouse takes this

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.170 
yeah so that means that mouse takes this
mousesports<00:07:30.810> it<00:07:31.199> takes<00:07:31.379> the<00:07:32.189> series<00:07:32.550> not<00:07:33.029> the

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
mousesports it takes the series not the

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.079 
mousesports it takes the series not the
series<00:07:33.479> takes<00:07:33.960> the<00:07:34.169> lead<00:07:34.349> in<00:07:34.620> the<00:07:34.770> series<00:07:35.089> to

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:36.089 
series takes the lead in the series to

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:39.700 
series takes the lead in the series to
to<00:07:36.210> one<00:07:36.710> they<00:07:37.710> need<00:07:37.919> two<00:07:38.069> more<00:07:38.219> wins<00:07:38.279> to<00:07:38.520> win<00:07:38.729> it

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
to one they need two more wins to win it

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.320 
to one they need two more wins to win it
who<00:07:40.710> I<00:07:40.740> will<00:07:41.039> have<00:07:41.159> to<00:07:41.189> get<00:07:41.399> three<00:07:42.529> so<00:07:44.330> that

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330 
who I will have to get three so that

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.899 
who I will have to get three so that
means<00:07:45.599> that<00:07:45.870> we'll<00:07:46.020> have<00:07:46.080> at<00:07:46.229> least<00:07:46.729> what<00:07:47.729> two

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:47.909 
means that we'll have at least what two

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:50.389 
means that we'll have at least what two
more<00:07:48.029> games<00:07:48.210> yeah<00:07:49.039> anyway<00:07:50.039> I'll<00:07:50.129> bring<00:07:50.279> you

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:50.399

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:52.949 
those I don't know who the next normally

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:54.980 
those I don't know who the next normally
but<00:07:53.069> it<00:07:53.159> will<00:07:53.250> be<00:07:53.279> featuring<00:07:53.789> fly<00:07:54.479> versus

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:54.990 
but it will be featuring fly versus

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.639 
but it will be featuring fly versus
someone<00:07:55.939> anyway<00:07:57.110> yeah<00:07:58.110> and<00:07:58.319> another

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 
interesting game with an innovative

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.519 
interesting game with an innovative
strategy<00:08:00.689> that<00:08:00.839> unfortunately<00:08:01.349> this<00:08:01.469> time

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:01.529 
strategy that unfortunately this time

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:03.619 
strategy that unfortunately this time
didn't<00:08:01.860> work<00:08:02.009> out<00:08:02.129> thanks<00:08:03.060> for<00:08:03.180> listening<00:08:03.509> is
