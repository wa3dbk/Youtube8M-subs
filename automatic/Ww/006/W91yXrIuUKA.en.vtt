so we'll half inch will with master
cylinder<00:00:16.369> right<00:00:17.369> there<00:00:17.730> you've<00:00:18.720> got<00:00:18.990> your

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
cylinder right there you've got your

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.400 
cylinder right there you've got your
break<00:00:19.560> masters<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.250> break<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> reservoir

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
break masters a break for the reservoir

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
break masters a break for the reservoir
you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.699> actually

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you can see that this was actually

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.859 
you can see that this was actually
supposed<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.250> hanging<00:00:26.250> pedal<00:00:26.789> mouth<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
supposed to be a hanging pedal mouth so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.259 
supposed to be a hanging pedal mouth so
it'll<00:00:28.199> look<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.529> down<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.150> what

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
it'll look like that down there but what

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
it'll look like that down there but what
I<00:00:30.300> did<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.050> inverted<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> mount<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> then

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
I did was I inverted the mount and then

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.930 
I did was I inverted the mount and then
cut<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> stem<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.380> had<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.520> guys<00:00:35.760> at

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
cut the stem and then had the guys at

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.380 
cut the stem and then had the guys at
the<00:00:36.059> Albany<00:00:36.360> speed<00:00:36.719> shop<00:00:37.760> Bend<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.940> broken

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the Albany speed shop Bend a broken

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
the Albany speed shop Bend a broken
breaker<00:00:39.660> bar<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> had<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
breaker bar that I had and then do it so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
breaker bar that I had and then do it so
it<00:00:41.760> works<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.950> something<00:00:43.950> like

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it works like that so something like

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
it works like that so something like
this<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.030> effective<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
this and it's really effective you can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.880 
this and it's really effective you can
see<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.469> bit<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> play

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
see there's just a little bit of play

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
see there's just a little bit of play
but<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.760> didn't<00:00:48.000> really

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but that's just because I didn't really

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690 
but that's just because I didn't really
tighten<00:00:48.480> everything<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
tighten everything up but this is it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.990 
tighten everything up but this is it
this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.469> I'm<00:00:53.460> already<00:00:53.789> at

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
this is like right here I'm already at

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.260 
this is like right here I'm already at
full<00:00:54.329> uh<00:00:54.770> full<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> pads

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
full uh full or this is where the pads

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
full uh full or this is where the pads
start<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> bite<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> calipers<00:00:58.770> like

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
start to bite into the calipers like

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
start to bite into the calipers like
from<00:00:59.760> here<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.180> pretty<00:01:00.390> much<00:01:00.480> lock<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
from here I can pretty much lock up the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
from here I can pretty much lock up the
rear<00:01:01.379> tires<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> plumbing<00:01:05.030> works

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
rear tires and then the plumbing works

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.080 
rear tires and then the plumbing works
something<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:08.930> see<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.610> does<00:01:11.610> she<00:01:11.850> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
something like that see it does she see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
something like that see it does she see
that<00:01:12.119> bolt<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.930> that's<00:01:13.170> where<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> seat

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that bolt there that's where the seat

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
that bolt there that's where the seat
belts<00:01:13.920> would<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> had<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> rear<00:01:15.509> seat

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
belts would go if you had a rear seat

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.580 
belts would go if you had a rear seat
and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.799> measured<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.490> hole<00:01:17.820> right

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and then I measured out that hole right

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.840 
and then I measured out that hole right
next<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.710> bolt<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> drilled<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
next to that bolt and drilled through it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
next to that bolt and drilled through it
drilled<00:01:21.180> through<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> bracket<00:01:21.600> behind<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
drilled through the bracket behind it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
drilled through the bracket behind it
then<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.220> real<00:01:23.460> careful<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> punch

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
then I'm just real careful not to punch

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.710 
then I'm just real careful not to punch
through<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> brake<00:01:24.780> lines<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.320> there

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
through the brake lines back there

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
through the brake lines back there
there's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> three<00:01:28.110> a.m.<00:01:28.500> braided<00:01:29.009> fitting<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
there's a three a.m. braided fitting and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340 
there's a three a.m. braided fitting and
then<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> master<00:01:30.720> cylinder<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
then for the master cylinder to the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.060 
then for the master cylinder to the
fitting<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.210> 1/8<00:01:33.210> inch<00:01:33.590> national<00:01:34.590> pipe

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
fitting is a 1/8 inch national pipe

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.300 
fitting is a 1/8 inch national pipe
thread<00:01:35.430> fitting<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> three<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> n<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.220> then

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thread fitting to a three a n and then

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.999 
thread fitting to a three a n and then
we<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.640> braided<00:01:39.030> line<00:01:40.310> under<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> car

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
we get more braided line under the car

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
we get more braided line under the car
in<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> colander<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> guys<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.299> see

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
in a colander this so you guys can see

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.630 
in a colander this so you guys can see
it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.399

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
so you guys can see this is the driver's

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.190 
so you guys can see this is the driver's
side<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.179> coolant<00:02:03.179> hose<00:02:03.359> sneaking

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
side we have coolant hose sneaking

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
side we have coolant hose sneaking
around<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.859> don't<00:02:05.850> stop<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.240> braided

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
around I don't stop at the braided

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.509 
around I don't stop at the braided
sneaking-around<00:02:08.569> coil<00:02:09.569> over<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.400> and<00:02:11.400> we

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
sneaking-around coil over here and we

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.690 
sneaking-around coil over here and we
have<00:02:11.549> more<00:02:11.730> line<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.599> boom<00:02:13.580> lighting<00:02:14.580> is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
have more line and then boom lighting is

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.610 
have more line and then boom lighting is
probably<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.480> bad<00:02:15.629> um<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.440> see

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
probably really bad um if you can see

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.770 
probably really bad um if you can see
that<00:02:17.209> from<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:18.959> that's<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.620> T

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
that from there but that's that's the T

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.030 
that from there but that's that's the T
that's<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.989> T<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:22.500> there's<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> hole

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that's the T and then there's the hole

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's the T and then there's the hole
that<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.310> made<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:25.709> where<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> goes<00:02:26.910> back

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that I made that's where it goes back

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.839 
that I made that's where it goes back
into<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> chassis<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.319> then<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.340> goes<00:02:29.549> over

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
into the chassis and then that goes over

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.300 
into the chassis and then that goes over
the<00:02:30.319> disk<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> passenger<00:02:32.640> side<00:02:33.799> I'm<00:02:34.799> going

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the disk to the passenger side I'm going

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.710 
the disk to the passenger side I'm going
to<00:02:35.400> take<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.610> picture<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> flash

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
to take a picture of that with the flash

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.020 
to take a picture of that with the flash
on<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.230> guys<00:02:37.379> see<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.700> really

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
on so you guys see it but it's really

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.569 
on so you guys see it but it's really
really<00:02:39.329> simple<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.959> do<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.170> probably<00:02:43.769> one

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
really simple to do this is probably one

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.610 
really simple to do this is probably one
of<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.910> coolest<00:02:45.450> mods<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.470> this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
of the coolest mods you can do for this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
of the coolest mods you can do for this
thing<00:02:46.879> also<00:02:47.879> probably<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.170> most

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
thing also probably one of the most

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.479 
thing also probably one of the most
pointless<00:02:49.680> unless<00:02:50.069> you're<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> be

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
pointless unless you're going to be

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.430 
pointless unless you're going to be
drifting<00:02:53.900> definitely<00:02:54.900> try<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.139> do<00:02:55.319> it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
drifting definitely try and do it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.039 
drifting definitely try and do it
yourself<00:02:55.829> because<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.489> was<00:02:56.670> quoted<00:02:57.060> $700<00:02:57.930> in

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
yourself because I was quoted $700 in

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.270 
yourself because I was quoted $700 in
labor<00:02:58.609> for<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.120> what<00:03:00.329> we<00:03:00.480> did<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:01.190> well<00:03:02.190> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
labor for this so what we did was well I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.430 
labor for this so what we did was well I
paid<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.849> out<00:03:03.030> $100<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.780> labor<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.139> didn't

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
paid this out $100 in labor I didn't

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.110 
paid this out $100 in labor I didn't
want<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.889> entrust<00:03:05.220> myself<00:03:05.400> drilling<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
want to and entrust myself drilling and

cheapest and this will be like a third
of<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.440> cost<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.829> what<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.010> paid<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.389> definitely

parking brake system definitely go for
it
