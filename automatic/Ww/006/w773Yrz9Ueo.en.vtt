given at the end since we met yesterday
we<00:00:29.189> only<00:00:29.369> had<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.179> Flair<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> x-ray

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we only had one see Flair and the x-ray

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.979 
we only had one see Flair and the x-ray
background<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:32.130> dropped<00:00:32.399> yet<00:00:32.579> further<00:00:32.989> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
background has dropped yet further so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.180 
background has dropped yet further so
let's<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> look<00:00:34.469> at<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> active<00:00:34.860> regions

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
let's take a look at the active regions

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.270 
let's take a look at the active regions
and<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.460> what's<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.890> we<00:00:37.890> still<00:00:38.129> only

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and see what's going on we still only

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.950 
and see what's going on we still only
have<00:00:38.430> three<00:00:38.850> officially<00:00:39.300> numbered<00:00:39.600> regions

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
have three officially numbered regions

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.299 
have three officially numbered regions
on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.110> disk<00:00:40.910> 1271<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> northeast<00:00:43.309> 1272

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
on the disk 1271 in the northeast 1272

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
on the disk 1271 in the northeast 1272
in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> southeast<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.079> 1273<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
in the southeast and 1273 in the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
in the southeast and 1273 in the
southwest<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.570> let's<00:00:48.719> take<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> each

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
southwest so let's take a look of each

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
southwest so let's take a look of each
of<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.680> individually<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.879> what's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of them individually and see what's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
of them individually and see what's
happened<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.570> since<00:00:51.629> yesterday<00:00:52.370> first

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
happened to them since yesterday first

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
happened to them since yesterday first
let's<00:00:53.550> take<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.000> region<00:00:54.239> 1271<00:00:54.930> which

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
let's take a look at region 1271 which

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
let's take a look at region 1271 which
is<00:00:55.410> by<00:00:55.530> far<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.800> biggest<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> best<00:00:56.550> region

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is by far the biggest and best region

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
is by far the biggest and best region
around<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.989> doesn't<00:00:58.289> seem<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.559> changed<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
around it doesn't seem to have changed a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.889 
around it doesn't seem to have changed a
great<00:00:58.920> deal<00:00:59.100> since<00:00:59.340> yesterday<00:01:00.090> except<00:01:00.780> for

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
great deal since yesterday except for

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
great deal since yesterday except for
there's<00:01:01.020> lots<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> small<00:01:01.500> group<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.800> spots<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
there's lots of small group of spots to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.229 
there's lots of small group of spots to
the<00:01:02.250> south<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.579> east<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.090> were

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the south and east and if we were

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
the south and east and if we were
looking<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.629> yesterday<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.100> two

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
looking at yesterday the other two

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
looking at yesterday the other two
separate<00:01:05.970> regions<00:01:06.150> still<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.869> new<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
separate regions still see new there and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.820 
separate regions still see new there and
is<00:01:07.680> still<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.130> yet<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.610> number<00:01:09.080> much<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.260> 1263

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
is still as yet on number much like 1263

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
is still as yet on number much like 1263
a<00:01:10.979> couple<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> weeks<00:01:11.490> ago<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.570> region<00:01:12.900> has

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a couple of weeks ago this region has

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.890 
a couple of weeks ago this region has
the<00:01:13.170> potential<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.680> flare<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> doesn't<00:01:15.750> seem

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the potential to flare but doesn't seem

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
the potential to flare but doesn't seem
to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> doing<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.970> we'll<00:01:17.970> take<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> look<00:01:18.299> at

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to be doing so and we'll take a look at

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.539 
to be doing so and we'll take a look at
the<00:01:18.570> coronal<00:01:19.290> images<00:01:19.650> later<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.310> see

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the coronal images later and see

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.410 
the coronal images later and see
possibly<00:01:21.119> why<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> case<00:01:23.240> next<00:01:24.240> let's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
possibly why this is the case next let's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
possibly why this is the case next let's
take<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> look<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.990> region<00:01:25.290> 1272<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
take a look at region 1272 in the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.940 
take a look at region 1272 in the
southeast

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
southeast

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
southeast
it<00:01:28.939> is<00:01:29.060> decayed<00:01:29.420> significantly<00:01:30.140> since

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
it is decayed significantly since

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.080 
it is decayed significantly since
yesterday<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.189> is<00:01:31.280> basically<00:01:31.729> just<00:01:31.759> one

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
yesterday and is basically just one

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.120 
yesterday and is basically just one
large<00:01:32.299> spot<00:01:32.689> with<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.899> few<00:01:33.229> very<00:01:33.560> very<00:01:33.860> tiny

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
large spot with a few very very tiny

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.580 
large spot with a few very very tiny
spots<00:01:34.549> surrounding<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.539> so<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.200> seems<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.439> have

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
spots surrounding it so it seems to have

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.350 
spots surrounding it so it seems to have
lost<00:01:36.740> most<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.070> its<00:01:37.159> trailer<00:01:37.490> spots<00:01:37.880> overnight

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
lost most of its trailer spots overnight

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.419 
lost most of its trailer spots overnight
this<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.229> not<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> good<00:01:39.619> omen<00:01:39.649> for<00:01:40.100> future

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
this is not a good omen for future

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.719 
this is not a good omen for future
activity<00:01:41.740> lastly<00:01:42.740> let's<00:01:42.979> look<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.250> detail<00:01:43.429> at

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
activity lastly let's look in detail at

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.289 
activity lastly let's look in detail at
region<00:01:44.299> 1273<00:01:44.929> in<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.530> southwest<00:01:46.210> now<00:01:47.210> this

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
region 1273 in the southwest now this

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.690 
region 1273 in the southwest now this
region<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.659> really<00:01:48.140> decayed<00:01:48.470> overnight<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.250> I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
region is really decayed overnight and I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.529 
region is really decayed overnight and I
suspect<00:01:49.880> will<00:01:50.210> be<00:01:50.299> gone<00:01:50.450> by<00:01:50.689> tomorrow<00:01:52.539> next

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
suspect will be gone by tomorrow next

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.819 
suspect will be gone by tomorrow next
let's<00:01:53.750> take<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.929> look<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.319> development<00:01:54.799> of

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
let's take a look at the development of

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.700 
let's take a look at the development of
dynamics<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.700> region's<00:01:56.110> using<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.409> data

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
dynamics of the region's using the data

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.789 
dynamics of the region's using the data
from<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.100> Solar<00:01:58.310> Dynamics<00:01:58.490> Observatory<00:01:58.939> in

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory in

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.139 
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory in
the<00:02:00.799> Sun<00:02:00.979> squad<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.310> magnetic<00:02:01.729> movies<00:02:02.000> I'd

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
the Sun squad of magnetic movies I'd

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.309 
the Sun squad of magnetic movies I'd
like<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.509> concentrate<00:02:02.899> on<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
like you to concentrate on the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.279 
like you to concentrate on the
development<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.799> region<00:02:04.130> 1271<00:02:04.959> the<00:02:05.959> region

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
development of region 1271 the region

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.080 
development of region 1271 the region
apparently<00:02:06.679> grows<00:02:06.979> as<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.520> comes<00:02:07.729> onto<00:02:07.909> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
apparently grows as it comes onto the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.729 
apparently grows as it comes onto the
disk<00:02:08.269> but<00:02:08.539> that's<00:02:08.690> more<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.019> function<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
disk but that's more of a function of a

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.710 
disk but that's more of a function of a
reduction<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.399> foreshortening<00:02:11.060> than

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
reduction in the foreshortening than

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.289 
reduction in the foreshortening than
real<00:02:12.079> growth<00:02:12.319> in<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> magnetic<00:02:13.040> field<00:02:13.310> so

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
real growth in the magnetic field so

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.960 
real growth in the magnetic field so
this<00:02:14.450> region<00:02:14.810> could<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.019> considered<00:02:15.290> stable

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
this region could be considered stable

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.610 
this region could be considered stable
which<00:02:16.970> again<00:02:17.239> is<00:02:17.299> not<00:02:17.599> considered<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.349> good

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
which again is not considered a good

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.000 
which again is not considered a good
omen<00:02:18.769> for<00:02:19.250> future<00:02:19.910> activity<00:02:20.650> let's<00:02:21.650> move<00:02:21.799> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
omen for future activity let's move to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.259 
omen for future activity let's move to
the<00:02:22.040> transition<00:02:22.340> region<00:02:22.579> using<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.090> dates

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
the transition region using the dates

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.819 
the transition region using the dates
from<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.599> aia<00:02:23.870> instrument<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.590> Solar

from the aia instrument on the Solar
Dynamics<00:02:25.040> Observatory<00:02:25.959> here<00:02:26.959> we're<00:02:27.140> looking

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
Dynamics Observatory here we're looking

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
Dynamics Observatory here we're looking
for<00:02:27.650> full<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.099> interruptions<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.760> prominence

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
for full of interruptions and prominence

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.569 
for full of interruptions and prominence
eruptions<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.959> again<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> think<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.340> kawatche

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
eruptions and again I think the kawatche

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.520 
eruptions and again I think the kawatche
word<00:02:31.819> here<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.090> potential<00:02:32.750> there<00:02:33.350> doesn't

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
word here is potential there doesn't

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.349 
word here is potential there doesn't
seem<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.829> have<00:02:33.920> any<00:02:34.069> any<00:02:34.489> in<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.670> last<00:02:34.850> 24

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
seem to have any any in the last 24

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.660 
seem to have any any in the last 24
hours<00:02:35.859> there<00:02:36.859> is<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> prominence<00:02:37.489> on<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
hours there is a prominence on the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.099 
hours there is a prominence on the
northwest<00:02:38.120> limb<00:02:38.329> that<00:02:38.359> had<00:02:38.720> looks<00:02:38.900> quite

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
northwest limb that had looks quite

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.599 
northwest limb that had looks quite
dynamic<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.829> everyone<00:02:40.069> has<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> potential

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
dynamic and everyone has the potential

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.789 
dynamic and everyone has the potential
of<00:02:40.819> erupting<00:02:41.299> and<00:02:41.989> there<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> large

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
of erupting and there is a large

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.180 
of erupting and there is a large
filament<00:02:43.670> near<00:02:44.180> Sun<00:02:44.600> Center<00:02:45.109> in<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.889> northern

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
filament near Sun Center in the northern

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.490 
filament near Sun Center in the northern
hemisphere<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.299> darkening<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.019> rising

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
hemisphere that is darkening and rising

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.190 
hemisphere that is darkening and rising
so<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.579> could<00:02:49.940> be<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.389> very<00:02:50.870> interesting

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
so that could be a very interesting

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280 
so that could be a very interesting
event<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:51.859> it<00:02:52.010> does<00:02:52.190> go<00:02:52.400> off<00:02:53.049> because<00:02:54.049> that

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
event if it does go off because that

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.830 
event if it does go off because that
would<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.590> pointed<00:02:55.100> straight<00:02:55.310> at<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.639> earth

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
would be pointed straight at the earth

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.690 
would be pointed straight at the earth
the<00:02:56.840> low-temperature<00:02:57.290> coronal<00:02:57.739> movie<00:02:58.010> again

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the low-temperature coronal movie again

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.690 
the low-temperature coronal movie again
we<00:02:58.880> should<00:02:58.940> concentrate<00:02:59.299> on<00:02:59.480> region<00:02:59.900> 1271

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
we should concentrate on region 1271

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
we should concentrate on region 1271

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
next 24 hours is there's a good chance

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.970 
next 24 hours is there's a good chance

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
of getting see flares and flares it just

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.950 
of getting see flares and flares it just
possible<00:05:07.330> but<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.480> chance<00:05:08.750> getting

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.410 
possible but the chance getting
ex-player<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.680> very<00:05:09.920> remote<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:11.030> sunspot

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.820 
number will remain stable we have a good
chance<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.670> coronal<00:05:13.970> mass<00:05:14.120> ejections<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.710> the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
chance of coronal mass ejections so the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.710 
chance of coronal mass ejections so the
wind<00:05:16.010> speed<00:05:16.100> will<00:05:16.370> remain<00:05:16.700> low<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.300> the

wind speed will remain low and the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.420 
wind speed will remain low and the
chance<00:05:17.930> getting<00:05:18.140> geomagnetic<00:05:18.710> storm<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.250> very

chance getting geomagnetic storm is very

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.260 
chance getting geomagnetic storm is very
poor<00:05:20.440> from<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.560> composite<00:05:21.950> coronal<00:05:22.370> image<00:05:22.610> we

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
poor from the composite coronal image we

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.820 
poor from the composite coronal image we
can<00:05:23.390> see<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.690> new<00:05:23.900> region<00:05:24.290> is<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:24.620> about<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
can see the new region is just about to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530 
can see the new region is just about to

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
come over the Northeast limb and in fact

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.140 
come over the Northeast limb and in fact
if<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.780> looked<00:05:26.990> at<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.290> x-ray<00:05:28.130> movie<00:05:28.940> you

if you looked at the x-ray movie you

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.330 
if you looked at the x-ray movie you
will<00:05:29.270> see<00:05:29.540> some<00:05:29.840> evidence<00:05:30.230> of<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.770> but<00:05:31.280> it

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
will see some evidence of it but it

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.740 
will see some evidence of it but it
doesn't<00:05:31.640> look<00:05:31.730> particularly<00:05:32.030> spectacular<00:05:32.300> at

the moment the others a trivia question

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.570 
the moment the others a trivia question
is<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.090> there<00:05:35.300> were<00:05:35.480> two<00:05:36.080> dogs<00:05:36.320> two<00:05:36.680> rats<00:05:37.190> and

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
is that there were two dogs two rats and

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.270 
is that there were two dogs two rats and
forty<00:05:38.480> mice<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:38.930> board<00:05:39.230> making<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.890> total<00:05:40.070> of
