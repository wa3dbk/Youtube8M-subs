understand why he still continues to do
it<00:06:23.590> and<00:06:25.020> he<00:06:26.020> wonders<00:06:26.500> why<00:06:27.100> he<00:06:27.250> gets<00:06:27.490> void<00:06:27.990> it's

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
it and he wonders why he gets void it's

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.450 
it and he wonders why he gets void it's
