00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.290
 This also has a form of the Finnish manufacturer generally the 45 year old 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 developed for the harsh Scandinavian winters 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.119
 You will see you immediately on the boys automatic braking system 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:13.630
 the boys are 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.919
 such as wood residues 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.050
 also grown crops such as elephant grass 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.370
 can very well be used as a replacement for existing ones 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.369
 fossil fuel heating installations 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.439
 The benefits of biomass are the lower heating costs 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.690
 these costs can be 50 to 75 percent lower, we are a staff 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.880
 gas fired installation 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.510
 paok first dived on biomass 7 2 neutral 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.550
 because no extra seo2 is produced 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.670
 but a short cycle has been reused from being washed 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.230
 this installation 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.650
 has a capacity of 150 kilowatts is automatically bombarded from the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 bunker tonight cup 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.270
 the fuel is elephant grass 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.910
 or miscanthus 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.320
 in a platform 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.020
 ruined 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.950
 these systems are suitable 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.190
 front wood action 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.990
 wood chips there is also a church 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.090
 and so on 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.860
 the incinerator is electronically controlled and is continuously measured 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 of temperature and oxygen 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 continuously updated 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.310
 a movable east care 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.790
 that the fire battles remains that the grass on the construction site 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.410
 the temperatures of the 800 and 900 degrees in the fires 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.890
 ensure optimum clean combustion 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.660
 the minimum if 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.040
 on the side of the fires 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.050
 to see the secondary combustion 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.310
 of the gas 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 the burner is made of cast iron that can withstand this high temperature 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 in the closed chain, optimal combustion is just a visit 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 as an example 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.440
 by purchasing different fans 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.000
 the primary and secondary another club 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 required for optimum combustion 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 automatically 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 after the inflammation vases that have just been seen 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.209
 the boiler starts to modulate 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.449
 you see a very nice calm image here 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.069
 with a shame 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.629
 biomass plan 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.219
 the structure of the boiler 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.669
 is vertical 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.279
 it has the advantage 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.959
 that as news 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.009
 for walking and the flue gases 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.829
 can no longer hit the boiler always to the bottom of the boiler 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.060
 this gives much less maintenance than the language skills 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.439
 the burning system 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.809
 and then a quadruple security 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.499
 against replanted 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:51.449
 solid fuels there is a risk of firing back via the auger 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.229
 goes to a bank 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.919
 for this, four are safely built-in 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.099
 consisting of various 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.590
 the first ensures that when the auger becomes warm, the firing automatically 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.879
 reversed after the burner 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.909
 the oxygen closes the seal 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.869
 a second is released 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.549
 then there are also two fire extinguishers 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.309
 which ensure that the fire never goes beyond and color centimeters too 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.309
 jack in can 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.799
 vtm has many file bunkers systems that start from half a cubic meter 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.109
 go up to 100 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.579
 they are all suitable for the old action 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.579
 who 45 p50 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.489
 a big advantage of this 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.950
 many different types of fuel can be stopped in that city 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.119
 you are universal, as it were 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.579
 as long as these fuels are clean 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.589
 the boiler and the control ensure optimum combustion 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:52.389
 this makes you less dependent on a regular supplier of fuel 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.499
 but you have the choice between many different options 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.089
 the robust cast iron drives 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.089
 ensure an effortless supply of biomass 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:08.349
 in a system that is factory adapted to customers' specific requirements 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.489
 and setups 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.549
 as a result, every drafter knew space in such a situation 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.150
 to make the combination in Kenya 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.509
 with a finnish 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.039
 veto heating cv system 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.099
 can you singer 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.330
 ensor faith 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.409
 ma also you need a friendly 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.309
 everything were full
