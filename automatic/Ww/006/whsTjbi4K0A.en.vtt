00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that scale as well as thinking of that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
that scale as well as thinking of that
in<00:01:15.750> terms<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:17.040> putting<00:01:17.310> together

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
having a difference in scale like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.420 
having a difference in scale like
everything's<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.500> shot<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> same

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
everything's not shot at the same

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.610 
everything's not shot at the same
distance

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
distance

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.110 
distance
you<00:01:25.160> know<00:01:25.280> having<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.240> bride

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.630 

also<00:01:29.930> like<00:01:30.200> one<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.100> things<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.340> think<00:01:31.490> of

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
also like one of the things to think of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.000 
also like one of the things to think of
two<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.060> like<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.870> fixed<00:01:33.230> lens<00:01:33.620> the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
two is like with a fixed lens the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.250 
two is like with a fixed lens the
variety<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.970> can<00:01:35.120> come<00:01:35.330> up<00:01:35.480> with<00:01:35.720> with<00:01:36.230> a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
variety that you can come up with with a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.620 
variety that you can come up with with a
single<00:01:36.710> focal<00:01:37.100> length<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.460> think<00:01:37.790> sometimes<00:01:38.000> we

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
single focal length I think sometimes we

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.300 
single focal length I think sometimes we
have<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:38.960> many<00:01:39.110> lenses<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.800> pick<00:01:39.980> from<00:01:40.190> that

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
have so many lenses to pick from that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.610 
have so many lenses to pick from that
you<00:01:40.700> can't<00:01:41.330> decide<00:01:41.660> sometimes<00:01:42.110> limiting

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
you can't decide sometimes limiting

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.400 
you can't decide sometimes limiting
yourself<00:01:42.790> walking<00:01:43.790> around<00:01:44.210> one<00:01:44.510> day<00:01:44.540> with<00:01:45.080> one

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
yourself walking around one day with one

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.890 
yourself walking around one day with one
focal<00:01:45.950> length<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.340> this<00:01:46.520> was<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.000> island

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
focal length so this was on the island

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.190 
focal length so this was on the island
of<00:01:47.960> spirito<00:01:48.560> santo<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.250> Vanuatu<00:01:49.970> which<00:01:50.960> was

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
as long as you include my husband at the

as long as you include my husband at the
shot<00:02:24.800> too<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.150> she<00:02:26.660> essentially<00:02:27.080> made<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
shot too so she essentially made the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.920 
shot too so she essentially made the
picture<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.070> much<00:02:28.310> better<00:02:28.580> because<00:02:28.970> she<00:02:29.780> had

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
picture that much better because she had

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.780 
picture that much better because she had
the<00:02:30.080> idea<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:30.770> let's<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.640> there

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the idea it's like let's get in there

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.420 
the idea it's like let's get in there
together<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:33.709> we<00:02:33.860> shot<00:02:34.070> this<00:02:34.250> we

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
together and it's like we shot this we

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.010 
together and it's like we shot this we
just<00:02:34.459> have<00:02:34.730> them<00:02:34.910> standing<00:02:35.510> middle<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
just have them standing middle of the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.680 
just have them standing middle of the
road<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.220> 35<00:02:37.760> millimeter<00:02:38.209> lens<00:02:38.450> this

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
road this is the 35 millimeter lens this

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.900 
road this is the 35 millimeter lens this
is<00:02:38.900> actually<00:02:39.620> shop<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:39.950> me<00:02:40.070> for<00:02:40.280> x1<00:02:40.700> which

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
is actually shop with me for x1 which

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.460 
is actually shop with me for x1 which
hasn't<00:02:41.120> fixed<00:02:42.340> 35m<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.730> zeiss<00:02:44.090> lens<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.900> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
hasn't fixed 35m to zeiss lens of it so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.530 
hasn't fixed 35m to zeiss lens of it so
it's<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:46.220> like<00:02:46.370> locking<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.060> down<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
it's it's like locking that down and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.270 
it's it's like locking that down and
just<00:02:47.870> shoot<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.200> when<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> wide-angle<00:02:48.739> lens

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
just shoot it when the wide-angle lens

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.479 
just shoot it when the wide-angle lens
shallow<00:02:50.120> down<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.630> field<00:02:50.930> but<00:02:51.650> bringing<00:02:52.220> this

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
shallow down the field but bringing this

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.520 
shallow down the field but bringing this
bring<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.180> out<00:02:53.420> where<00:02:53.720> other<00:02:54.200> people<00:02:54.290> whose

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
bring this out where other people whose

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.260 
bring this out where other people whose
picture<00:02:54.890> afterwards<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.700> sort<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.030> like

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
picture afterwards and it sort of like

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.260 
picture afterwards and it sort of like
the<00:02:56.720> south

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
the south

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.110

sometimes your subjects have really good
ideas<00:03:02.480> I've<00:03:03.480> run<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:03.950> meanwhile<00:03:04.950> we

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
ideas I've run with that meanwhile we

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130 
ideas I've run with that meanwhile we
did<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.490> picture<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.270> saw<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.810> was

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
did this picture and I just saw I was

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.600

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
down by the side of the water and I saw

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850 
down by the side of the water and I saw

this guy with fishing nets I think they

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
this guy with fishing nets I think they
probably<00:03:11.040> recovered<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.820> he<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.150> walking
