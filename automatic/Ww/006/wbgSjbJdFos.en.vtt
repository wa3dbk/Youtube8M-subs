like we add in the PSP this thing that

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.810 
like we add in the PSP this thing that
always<00:01:44.340> broke<00:01:46.250> there<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> bits<00:01:47.700> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
always broke there you go the bits of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.690 
always broke there you go the bits of
the<00:01:47.880> size<00:01:48.030> comparison<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:52.700> well

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the second thickness it looks like in a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
the second thickness it looks like in a
way<00:01:55.670> okay<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> battery<00:01:58.530> go<00:02:00.619> anyway

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
way okay so it was the battery go anyway

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
way okay so it was the battery go anyway
I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.399> I'll<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.729> leave

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

this<00:02:03.540> video<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> fear<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> probably<00:02:04.469> restart

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
this video I fear and I probably restart

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
this video I fear and I probably restart
it<00:02:05.219> once<00:02:05.369> I've<00:02:05.549> got<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.939> battery<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
otherwise this was the charging adapter

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.949 
otherwise this was the charging adapter
brick<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.489> anyway<00:02:17.090> let's<00:02:17.690> see<00:02:17.780> if<00:02:17.840> we've<00:02:17.930> got

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
brick so anyway let's see if we've got

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.589 
brick so anyway let's see if we've got
some<00:02:18.230> power<00:02:18.409> on<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:22.810> maybe<00:02:23.920> yes<00:02:24.920> no<00:02:25.330> yes<00:02:26.330> we

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
some power on this maybe yes no yes we

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.860 
some power on this maybe yes no yes we
have<00:02:26.750> power<00:02:28.330> first<00:02:29.330> power<00:02:29.540> for<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
