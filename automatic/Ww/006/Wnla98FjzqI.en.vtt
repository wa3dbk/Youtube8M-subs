00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.630
 Hey, people, mtv Brazil 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.719
 This is mike. 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.939
 and we are going to play you the insistent game 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.149
 - I like 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.550
 the feline right foot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.249
 I ended up cooperating 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.099
 well it would do 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.019
 were delivered questioned 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.019
 ituano and placed street cameron 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.369
 put the right hand and rather warm 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 he came with everything 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.280
 an interesting thing 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.810
 on the sketch 3 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.080
 when you press 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.190
 is bad 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.210
 Are you going to have it down? 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.530
 she is michael will fix it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.330
 It should be in the afternoon 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
 You will vote for that. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.800
 How do we say that the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.960
 the kiosks on the subway 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.130
 the innovator 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 why the maneuvers is done in the right analogue 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 but I already met in the game 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.270
 the country on the night that the right also 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.040
 ef 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.450
 and that is not very good the terminal these maneuvers 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.600
 on a different network 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 it is with this posture 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.110
 Good game for you guys. 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.120
 and you did not play that game anymore. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.360
 ef 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 these three weeks 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.420
 variety of clothes 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 but the white house the age 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 lila pedestrian downs is because he 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870
 it's the great truth 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.870
 in short did not squeeze with the marks 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.030
 has a wide variety of seeds 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 be on the toucan plate 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 systematically 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.299
 one thing I think I really have that this month is when you're with 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.149
 the logo of the region era 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.279
 she stays is 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.359
 her touch 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.689
 all health yes 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.339
 and while you are in BermÃºdez 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.339
 the character is all grated 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.169
 It's very very slowly. 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.769
 one thing less than the 3 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.129
 the second phase 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.949
 is to create and your team 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.469
 making mentions 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.849
 the senate 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.919
 keep the city to your mark 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.919
 It's still not known how it is. 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.729
 also falls 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.739
 I do not know what that is exactly it 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.739
 the average points for now I only have 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.219
 the 1,700 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.089
 the ericsson 4 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 guesses but still lacking 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.419
 so let's see 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.059
 is adapted to the city 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.049
 let's try sea 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:19.950
 and can debut 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.399
 have the donations 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.369
 in layoffs layoffs that the young women contact them 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 the places where you can 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.749
 here he says he wants the servant tests that he wants 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 exhibitor 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.489
 is the male and female miami mogi 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.269
 Here's the catch. 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.339
 at the time beutel the hair 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.569
 if you want to leave those who are ripe the goal 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.729
 the medications of the phase 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.870
 here's the ballad 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.870
 and notifications of attacks 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.010
 a doll 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.949
 as you can see that it has several brands 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.699
 several well-known brands of the games ranking the schema team michael zilm 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.629
 right type 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.629
 in several neighborhoods 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.709
 and one penalty per month 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.189
 here shirts 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.919
 the shirt on it 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.990
 I'm done 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 slater 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.840
 many names 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.090
 Who says we have to score here softly? 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.599
 accessories such as glasses 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.559
 the servers 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:52.020
 the customer chooses the month 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 here you can choose the type of hot scenes 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.919
 and if he can do 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.919
 like I did here 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.830
 the serginho 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.740
 where a Mayan movie 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 matinee a state painting 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.620
 iii 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.520
 this scenario 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.939
 of the presence 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.520
 I know the band subscribers 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.939
 a logo 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.150
 you can question the brands sponsored by the hot 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.349
 before mike 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.419
 she foot style brand 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.419
 then come around I added my brand 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.229
 that you read do a commemoration signed for seven days 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.039
 this is what you want 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.039
 bush who said that squid is 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.159
 the aggressive style 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.310
 here if you want 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.310
 leave the Turks dead for sins 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 the ban 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.490
 but I also have 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.400
 your profile in the progression that you 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.850
 was 8 89 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.860
 with 39% 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.860
 here some states ask us to betis 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.930
 in profile 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.930
 in the midst of tension 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.809
 of shortcuts to win draws - closed and look for everything 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:47.279
 this can end badly that even maneuvers of the southeast the maneuvers 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.399
 your children's interests are suspended you succeeded 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.809
 bush was elected six months 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:58.449
 more or less had a voice for 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.830
 you search 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.460
 in the beginning when you play 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 skateboards 3 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.119
 I do not stop her from taking a shower, she says the three of them are not pillaging 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:16.659
 month and failed to take life 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.659
 I thought it was impossible to make a move any more 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.699
 but still pop 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.990
 even doing the following as he comments that although 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.099
 but states that it prevented him from doing so 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.589
 How is the combat? 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:34.589
 and this team will be when you have closed consistent 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.849
 also says that these bash-tapping people pass by on the street 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:44.830
 yesterday in colombo 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.830
 Everyone can see that cars do not stop. 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:53.360
 the benfica starts but I do not know what happened 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.719
 we are not afraid 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:58.219
 So let's finish our analysis. 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.939
 I think this respect 

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:02.849
 Thank you so much, everyone.
