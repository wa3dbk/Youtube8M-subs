00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 I remember these events well that's why u 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.650
 I was touring in Vladivostok 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.630
 and when i found out what's going on here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.400
 supreme council here's tanks in moscow 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.910
 introduced I quit touring 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 and I flew to Moscow and I was left on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 gigs 5 still far east i 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 flew in and you know I am not ashamed 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 confess I am a sincere person 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.750
 only a fool doesn't change his mind in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.190
 life so here i flew 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:45.989
 protect eggs I was an ardent opponent 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.260
 the Communist Party and not that the Soviet government order 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.879
 what happened during the Soviet era 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 opponent of the torment of communism I was not 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 never seemed to me that communism 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 easier to reach a democratic way 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.789
 hereby they are pseudo democratically but i 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.400
 bitterly mistaken and I have to tell you 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.869
 that I have a completely different opinion now 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.390
 I knew Yeltsin, we played 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.960
 tennis 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 sometimes some kind of matches and me this person 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 really liked it because it is in the first place 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.000
 when he asked me to tell what I saw 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 in the country 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 interesting he was very cool to react 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.490
 he reacted it was there that I laughed between 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 where the most intelligent audience laughs 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.700
 in the hall on those places and I am very 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:46.320
 liked him telling it and he like 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.100
 I would feel that I was telling him 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.490
 about an interesting life in Russia I am very 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.549
 believed him 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.560
 wary of his surroundings 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.930
 first wary note i contacted 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.899
 start then I'm just so 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.899
 disillusioned with surroundings in politics 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.810
 and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.530
 in officials and in everything related to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:22.489
 business that now believe in 93 I 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:26.450
 who of our top driver is not 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.030
 met with nobody familiar with anyone 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.409
 of the officials are not friends with anyone of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.909
 businessmen i have no relationship 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:41.810
 I do not do any business one by one 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.420
 simply because I saw her price 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.879
 surrounded by 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.569
 which did not bother at all 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.599
 ideas about making people better off 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.780
 that they rowed rowed by themselves watched 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.230
 I follow these events on TV then 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.810
 I thought it was a little show 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.799
 something pre-installed cameras like 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.639
 so immediately everyone in the whole world has become 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.579
 show 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.150
 I never treated myself like 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.480
 fool 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.650
 Yes, I was mistaken many times but it was 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.000
 delusions of romance rather than fools 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 because any person who believes he 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.310
 Romantic not every dollar who sees
