then I think my leisure rajan's username

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.420 
then I think my leisure rajan's username
is<00:06:14.990> in<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.200> description<00:06:15.349> below<00:06:15.800> but<00:06:16.160> if<00:06:16.250> not

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
is in the description below but if not

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.070 
is in the description below but if not
it's<00:06:16.639> just<00:06:16.849> me<00:06:17.060> ceremony<00:06:17.570> 24<00:06:19.060> yeah<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.300> just

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
it's just me ceremony 24 yeah I just

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.080 
it's just me ceremony 24 yeah I just
think<00:06:21.349> that<00:06:21.410> a<00:06:21.530> lot<00:06:21.710> of<00:06:21.770> leap<00:06:22.010> basically<00:06:22.700> costs

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
think that a lot of leap basically costs

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.909 
think that a lot of leap basically costs
like<00:06:23.240> my<00:06:23.419> schedules<00:06:23.870> pretty<00:06:23.960> up<00:06:24.260> YouTube<00:06:24.740> it

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.260 
like my schedules pretty up YouTube it
gives<00:06:25.160> it<00:06:25.220> pretty<00:06:25.460> much<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.669> whole<00:06:25.729> week<00:06:26.030> off

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270
