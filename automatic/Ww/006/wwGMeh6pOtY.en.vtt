 the Pope 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.480
 every guy who pays his price should 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.400
 get to know 1 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.289

 You 're young, have not played any more. 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.060
 You should at least have heard of it. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 This game is a shooting game in 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.820
 first person is made by our 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.580
 dearest and software 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.870
 it is a game that marked the history of 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.690
 fps is and 13 has been released 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.030
 originally in 2004 he did not run away 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.890
 this rule right and he was in the book 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 he was released he was 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.960
 considered a game that was beyond 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.739
 technology presented at the time he was 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.589
 as if it were a game that was beyond 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.510
 its time we can say so and 13 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.070
 he lives that marked the time he was 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 released today, maybe not all 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.640
 world played right 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.610
 only the newest games but it is a good 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.070
 essential to id software she solved 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.260
 relaunch this game and released from 1 3 bi 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.120
 true remastering on HD 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.960
 but it's not only that it actually goes 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.360
 plus a simple remastering on HD 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.820
 and I'll tell some of this to you guys 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.810
 now this brief analysis that I did 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.090
 about ed chan 3ds game he's a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.159
 definitive collection that I can say 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.170
 thus, the definitive collection 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.630
 from the series 1 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.060
 he brings all the games in the series 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.760
 included in 1 in a single game 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.800
 it brings a clear of the classics is that it is 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.650
 the first 12 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.830
 it also brings 13 obvious and brings the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.740
 expansion of 13 which is 13 ressurection 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.750
 stated and in addition it brings a package 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 new resignations right? 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.700
 titled the lost mission 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.190
 a series of new emissions there that do not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.789
 had of the original passage was made 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.420
 exclusively for this edition, the 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.800
 3g offers a new experience this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.280
 fgd chan edition 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.820
 by the fact that it's basically expensive you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.860
 It has the opportunity to meet you here 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.060
 the series if you do not know and if you are 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.100
 fan guy 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.040
 This is an essential game for your 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.150
 collection even if you have already played the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.980
 of 3 nÃ© 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.930
 It's worth it here because you're going to have one. 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.930
 package of special missions that do not 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.440
 call 13 among other things 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.570
 good the graphic part of the game she was not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.270
 basically play game uses the same 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.940
 graphic engine were changed some 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.290
 things like the lighting effect were 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.470
 improved right 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.870
 is the forgotten bridge were also 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.000
 improved the bridge serving scheme 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.670
 compared to the original game but 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.580
 basically the game uses the same engine 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.040
 which he used in 2004 khan 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.400
 What I do not really know I do not 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.320
 I can play 13 and they feel even bad 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.230
 today we see the graphic leave 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.270
 with 11 games with absurd graphics right 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.830
 I can not find engine 13 bad 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.209
 Dude, I do not know why. 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.650
 and that of 13 despite using it even 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.900
 engine I play and it's nice to know I 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.040
 game thinking that the graph is a shit 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.660
 bad graphics 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 this was an engine that definitely 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.620
 she got really expensive 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.570
 unlike some children do not 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.600
 age well, you already have 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.390
 notes that an identity 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.590
 here you notice that an old church but 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.920
 but that does not bother me, it tastes good. 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.720
 game brings a multiplayer mode as well 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.709
 multiplayer mode that is actually well 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.280
 we do not have classics like 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.980
 efe met from other game modes there is 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.709
 everything very simple and resembles 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.080
 quite a multimode mode that 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.360
 players of the game was that three arena who 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.430
 threw the arena there 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.079
 the dodo multiplayer mode it resembles 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.750
 enough is that for that rhythm 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.120
 frenetic and as intended 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.789
 fun not that thing so 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.700
 as in some countries. 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.630
 multiplayers out there 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.180
 good 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.620
 in the opera summary which was 13 bmg 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.460
 edition or you can not make a 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.830
 very deep analysis of this game until 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.140
 because he does not bring much news he is 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.900
 basically what I told you 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.440
 at the beginning of the video in it is a 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.790
 definitive experience of the gift of the series 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.760
 of one as a whole and is cool to the case 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.560
 you do not know seriously you can through 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.560
 this game is a good opportunity to 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.230
 you know and if you are a fan too 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.070
 like I said he has a 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.360
 opportunity for you to have this in your hands 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.580
 This is the definitive edition of this great game. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.820
 just one more thing the game he was 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.290
 changed the flashlight scheme of the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.350
 game one of the things that the galley 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.950
 in the original 13 is that you do not 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.650
 could use a flashlight and at the same time 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.080
 that is if you are lucky using the 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.030
 gun you could not use flashlight and if 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.900
 You use this flashlight, you could not. 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.850
 to use what was a thing that sometimes 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.370
 is hindered because the game environment 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.170
 they are very dark and you can not 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.290
 use lanterns environment gets a little 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.750
 Difficult visibility during gameplay 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.670
 This was successful now you can use 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.130
 my same time flashlight 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.410
 well I think that this antenna pitch 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.900
 13 original did not see this as a defect 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.390
 man, many people criticized this but I 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.250
 I think the idea of age when put 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.780
 this scheme of the flashlight and was 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.000
 precisely to increase the climate of 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.990
 tension in the game, right? 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.020
 it is because there the end of 13 even though 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.810
 a fps he bet heavily on the thing of the 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.790
 survival horror horror anyway 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.740
 You being a well deserved guy I killed 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.530
 everything that kills everything that moves in the 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.260
 your mac on your way but still the 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.900
 game still gives a scare if you use 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.930
 obviously you play in such an environment. 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.270
 dark such a good 7 net is still 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.680
 possible to be frightened by this game 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:39.139
 What is interesting that is good, right? 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.310
 General that was 13 bfg edition 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:46.819
 and is essential for any fan of fps 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.430
 face and or any fan of the band's series 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.599
 of the overall 11 then highly 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.159
 recommended 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.949
 This is my tip today to 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.389
 You of 13 May, it's not worth it. 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.069
 just remembering that it is a game 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:02.029
 multi platform is available both 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:03.860
 for pc xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:06.680
 this version of game play that you are 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:10.279
 seeing the stick in the video is the pc version 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.319
 is available on xi for $ 30 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:14.080
 that is not an expensive price he is not 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.909
 being sold for a price of a game 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.110
 new launch and is being sold by 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:19.490
 30 dollars 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.370
 I believe the console version 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.020
 should also be sold for a 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.110
 price below 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.289
 I know of one of a new game launch 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:34.729
 Ok, that 's it folks 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:37.490

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.020
 analysis of this game this is a format 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:47.509
 different that maybe make more videos 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.400
