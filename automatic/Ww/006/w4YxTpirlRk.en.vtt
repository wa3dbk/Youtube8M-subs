00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:11.249
 Hi, about two months ago. 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.690
 that I started a diet 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:20.910
 I was on the soup diet and I had 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.990
 eliminated 15 pounds in a week more 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.700
 or less a week and a half, but only 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.370
 She is very receptive and hungry. 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 And then I decided to give up then, my friend. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:46.380
 my keane presented for all 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:50.750
 our other friends a diet that is 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.350
 dukan diet and for me she is being 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 wonderful thing I had started with 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 another diet a person of 89 pounds 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:12.440
 I found it for 84 with the cam 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 I'm already 75 and is enough weight and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.869
 I have to tell you that it's okay. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 very worth the effort and determination to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.119
 People have to have a lot of willpower. 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.940
 Because it's a lot of hot stuff to eat. 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.900
 arrives at the end of the week, the family 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.670
 meets 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.439
 then that barbecue barn is salty 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.049
 mayonnaise is dessert and during the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.590
 week also has 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.290
 I have a two year old son and he was 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.220
 Child, he likes to eat bullshit. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.200
 five years 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750
 so there was one time I was giving 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.939
 a chocolate tart for him that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 chocolate is the chocolate that had so 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.939
 that he was pure knows and I am giving in one with 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.979
 a spoon the new rate of chocolate and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.960
 with another woman the Latin fir committee 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.940
 it was for me 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.230
 It was a yes year I died but I got it. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.820
 and I have to tell who it is 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 starting because you want to start 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.900
 any type of diet re-education 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 food for those who want to change a little 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.850
 life does not give up it does not let it up 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.430
 because there is why my husband was 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.840
 eating this I had to eat my son 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.370
 I was eating that and it gave me a lot 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 The will of my ordinary dukan diet is a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.830
 diet here who does knows that it is not anymore 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.160
 direct on a diet of very little cockroach 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.650
 I used to spend a lot of money to keep her. 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 meat is a lot of white meat a lot of meat 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.130
 red 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.200
 he had 34 have to eat for example is 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.750
 light curd and all that curd 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.730
 light and zero all that is more 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.900
 healthy possible 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 It's expensive, we know it's expensive. 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.320
 so it 's a lot of investment for the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.030
 We have little determination to have 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.220
 a focus 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.920
 We do not get anywhere, this is 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.459
 to any outfit anyone 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.070
 At the time of his life he understood then 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.030
 so it's worth the effort the dedication 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.030

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.810

 getting fat is not getting fat 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.989

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.720
 by lean mass understood is defining 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.610

 right ingredients to do this to you 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:30.110
 It makes the food itself

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.730
 Selling in your head that does it wrong 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.750

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.390
 day 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.700
 No one will eat because they do not die because they do not. 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.110
 to be eating a whole plate of pasta 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.640
 weekend 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:13.490
 No one dies, it's an adult.

 doctrine is to indoctrinate your life doctrine 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.240
