00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.210
 very dramatic look in which a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 gradient of color of dark clear it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 recommended for the night since the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.119
 colors that most use go black or 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 gray is navy blue but also 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.450
 like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.110
 we start applying first in everything 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.570

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.990

 I'm going to withdraw the excess product and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.570
 I will also give my stamp 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.660

 mac I apply it flush with my eyelashes 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.770
 higher and I start to delineate 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.770
 until there is something like that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.049
 I apply mascara on my upper lashes and 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.860
 Also do not forget to apply in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.860
 tabs below 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330
 since the eyes were ready we are going 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.220
 with the face and first we eliminate the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.060
 makeup that we could have fallen to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.610
 face 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.170
 we apply primer to prepare our 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.170
 skin to receive makeup 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.990
 we read visagism using the base more 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.850
 clear and a darker one we apply in 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.850
 this area to highlight the cheekbones 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.390
 in this part of the nose to fine tune the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.409
 in these areas to hide the double chin 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.409
 your neck looks more elongated 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.460
 and in this last area it also makes 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 your face looks more elongated we will repeat 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.990
 the same but now with the base more 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.090
 clear and we will apply it in the areas that 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.340
 we want to highlight unlike the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.400
 dark base that gives depth and 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.550
 diminishes imperfections and white 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.040
 highlight 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.159
 i 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.019
 and now we start to blur, I started 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.019
 blurring the clearer base 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.000
 and from there it continues with the dark base not 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.070
 it has to be completely removed from 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.220
 still have to be noticed and already 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.260
 with the base is going to cover better in this 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.540
 part blurs until it gets lost in your 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.870
 hair 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.910
 and now with the base of your color you are going to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.500
 cover and make up your whole face uses 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.720
 this brush as if you were giving 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.420
 slight successes and movements 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.970
 circular as they end you have to 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.850
 see your skin but you will notice 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.770
 the visagism we will repeat giving light and 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.040
 shadow for now with this makeup on 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.190
 Apply white powder where you apply the 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.110
 the white base and I apply the color 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.080
 chocolate where the base applies more 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.529
 dark giving light to my cheekbones to my 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.039
 chin 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.630
 giving my cheekbones darkness 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.210
 front 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.810
 and my nose 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.090
 and finishing applying the blog I used 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.520
 This color is like orange but with a 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.099
 little bit of geimer smiled to highlight 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.380
 my little apples and from there applied 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.090
 the blog up does not have to be seen 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.150
 so loaded with blogs since the point 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.889
 focal are our eyes I use cármenes 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.889
 to protect my laves the dryness 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.270
 and then applied this gloss that is very 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.580
 similar to the tone of my blog is from mac 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.280
 from the glam live collection 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.289
