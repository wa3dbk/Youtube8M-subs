00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.910
 i 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.299
 on March 11 the solar telescope 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.279
 dynamics observatory was able to capture the 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.369
 image of what appears to be an object 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.310
 really huge gigantic near the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.580
 sun and not only that seems to be 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.140
 taking energy from the sun at first 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.980
 instance let's show you here the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.890
 images because this is one of the cases 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.410
 most important has taken on a relevance 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.510
 on the internet phenomenal is 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.839
 discussing around the world what is 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.210
 try this imagine you a UFO from 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.460
 size of the planet earth does not believe it 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.679
 let's see this information and from 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.679
 then the images with fernando correa 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.010
 the nasa dynamic solar telescope 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 he caught the presence of a spherical object 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.640
 dark very close to the sun that seems 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.460
 be absorbing the energy of our 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.730
 star something that has never before been 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.100
 and observed by the distance that 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.860
 is from the solar surface should 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.950
 be huge possibly greater than 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.010
 our planet observe with all 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.540
 attention the dark scene remained 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.550
 near the sun for more than 80 hours 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.220
 when he left he generated tremendous 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.770
 turbulence in the solar atmosphere that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.470
 stirred for more than 5 hours what 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.580
 would show that the object 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 unknown is there 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.130
 this object is in the archives 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.760
 original images of the system 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.510
 nasa helio bioware we managed to confirm 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.700
 that effectively this black sphere 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.910
 It appears in the shots from March 8 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.770
 2012 at 14 hours time 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.870
 universal when it begins to be visible 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.780
 it is clearly approaching and 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.010
 observe that it comes from an area outside 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.750
 of the sun when approaching it is attracting 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:16.110
 filaments of surface energy 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.400
 solar remained that way until 12 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 March date on which it was disappearing 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.130
 approximately from 0 o'clock with 15 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.750
 minutes when he started to retire 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.110
 note again how it generates 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.330
 turbulence in the solar atmosphere 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.270
 flames of fire by the presence of 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.270
 object was shaken for almost 6 hours 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.480
 the telescope controllers 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 spatially confused 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.750
 trying to explain this event 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.750
 never registered before there are no 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.180
 background of something like there is no 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.030
 records of some strange object that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.470
 it seems to be absorbing the energy 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.080
 of the sun 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.970
 the dynamic solar telescope with which 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.550
 was captured this video is the last 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.850
 solar space telescope that launched the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.920
 nasa on February 11, 2010 the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.310
 first image he captured from the sun he 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.990
 got in April 2010 and since then 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.910
 lcdo in orbit around the sun observes 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.730
 permanently to our star 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.050
 during almost two years of observations 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.240
 uninterrupted never before the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.840
 dynamic solar telescope had 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.880
 registered something like this the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.010
 NASA's solar scientists have 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.880
 I tried to explain this event 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.810
 as a natural phenomenon like a hole 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.140
 in the solar corona a possibility that 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.180
 it must be investigated deeply by 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 what this investigation 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.810
 to be continue
