 for six years I own my own 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.230
 flying school that goes from initiation 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.230
 to perfection 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.969
 school

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.980
 outside of my flight school I 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.450
 created that four years ago now 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.560
 it is to try to develop a little 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.090
 all the pilots in alsace lorraine 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440
 succeed in following them on all 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.150
 races with a physical program while 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.840
 winter with programs this internship is 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 formulated the year 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.649

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 followed a time on a full day 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020

 with debriefing between midday tips 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.240
 new motorcycle tuning techniques 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.660
 finally presents us burgaud geybels 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.910
 episode tubes and 2014 champion 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.470
 of Alsace-Lorraine 85 hopes that will 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.260
 still for me that in 125 who will you 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.129
 talk a bit about the hugo structure in 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 what do I bring you 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.510
 concretely during the winter beats everything 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.220
 winter you coach us for six months 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.540
 we do a lot of physics 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.269
 he gives us a program and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.430
 frankly it helps a lot especially on 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.470
 the mind and on trust gives us 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.599
 trust in us at the racing level 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.160
 well, all that is briefing is 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.470
 really good because like that it's 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.049
 what's wrong what's going on we need it 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.580
 also because we are not going to do all the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.530
 time the same mistakes so that's 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.000
 frankly it's good you are you are 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.799
 there on the starting grid for us 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.150
 help to choose the right traces is 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.930
 all the time motivating it's 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.030
 it was really good it's good 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.950
 so here I am the father of carlo 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.379
 carlos has been two years that in the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.019
 structure before Quentin Briclot 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:26.129
 that they were joining the Czech team 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.450
 13 12 15 and his first year in the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.859
 team in 85 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.620
 he passed 4th so for me that's all 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.260
 simply fabulous and a job a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.260
 work and when an extraordinary nati 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.440
 with the team we all have the same 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.210
 deco all the same outfits it's 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.470
 really a proper structure in 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.850
 rarely find it on the island 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.990
 found earlier knowing that France 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.910
 I 'm trying to do that in league for 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.680
 really develop the sport in league 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.970
 alsace lorraine has remained developing 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.450
 young people to take them to 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.450
 france later
