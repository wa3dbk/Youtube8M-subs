make two pizza cutters like what we have
right<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:46.150> first<00:01:46.450> thing<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.080> want

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
right here the first thing that you want

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.710 
right here the first thing that you want
to<00:01:47.440> do<00:01:47.620> is<00:01:47.860> cut<00:01:48.190> off<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.490> salvage<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.510> your

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
to do is cut off the salvage of your

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.140 
to do is cut off the salvage of your
fabric<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.860> your<00:01:51.040> fabric<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.580> wide<00:01:51.790> enough<00:01:52.090> to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
fabric so your fabric is wide enough to

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.300 
fabric so your fabric is wide enough to
cover<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.720> box<00:01:52.930> but<00:01:53.290> let's<00:01:53.500> go<00:01:53.650> ahead<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.130> cut

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
cover the box but let's go ahead and cut

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.520 
cover the box but let's go ahead and cut
the<00:01:54.460> selvage<00:01:54.880> off<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.900> out<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.410> way

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the selvage off to get it out of the way

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.340 
the selvage off to get it out of the way
so<00:01:57.250> cut<00:01:57.460> your<00:01:57.640> Salvage<00:01:58.150> off<00:01:58.360> down<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.020> entire

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
so cut your Salvage off down the entire

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.000 
so cut your Salvage off down the entire
length<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.460> fabric<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.350> first<00:02:02.650> thing<00:02:02.890> you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
length of the fabric the first thing you

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.890 
length of the fabric the first thing you
need<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.220> do<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.760> start<00:02:03.970> covering<00:02:04.420> your<00:02:04.510> pizza
