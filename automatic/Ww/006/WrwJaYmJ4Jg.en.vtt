hi<00:00:00.659> everyone<00:00:00.960> today<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.040> show<00:00:02.220> you

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi everyone today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.550 
hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.550> make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.120> square<00:00:03.419> mandala<00:00:03.959> using

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
how to make a square mandala using

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.369 
how to make a square mandala using
tracing<00:00:05.100> paper<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.640> started<00:00:06.480> off<00:00:06.690> by<00:00:06.720> cutting

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
tracing paper I started off by cutting

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.470 
tracing paper I started off by cutting
my<00:00:07.529> tracing<00:00:08.130> paper<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.000> size<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
my tracing paper to the size of the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720 
my tracing paper to the size of the
square<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.960> wanted<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.099> 5<00:00:11.490> inches

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
square I wanted and this one is 5 inches

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.180 
square I wanted and this one is 5 inches
by<00:00:12.030> 5<00:00:12.269> inches<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.259> I'm<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.530> measuring<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.070> up

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
by 5 inches and I'm just measuring it up

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.049 
by 5 inches and I'm just measuring it up
to<00:00:14.340> my<00:00:14.460> cardstock

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to my cardstock

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.320 
to my cardstock
now<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.500> fold<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.460> tracing<00:00:18.150> paper

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
now I'm going to fold the tracing paper

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.700 
now I'm going to fold the tracing paper
in<00:00:19.230> triangles<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:21.170> diagonally<00:00:22.170> both<00:00:22.410> ways

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
in triangles going diagonally both ways

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.359 
in triangles going diagonally both ways
and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:24.810> squares<00:00:25.230> by<00:00:25.590> folding<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> in

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and then in squares by folding it in

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.679 
and then in squares by folding it in
half<00:00:26.400> both<00:00:27.000> ways<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.760> then<00:00:29.760> once<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.480> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
half both ways and then once you have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
half both ways and then once you have
that<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.309> draw<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> design

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that you are going to draw your design

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
that you are going to draw your design
on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.020> tracing<00:00:34.559> paper<00:00:34.710> instead<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
on the tracing paper instead of the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
on the tracing paper instead of the
cardstock<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:38.000> I'm<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.329> using<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.870> simple

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
cardstock and I'm just using a simple

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.150 
cardstock and I'm just using a simple
design<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> tutorial<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:44.040> bit

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
design to make the tutorial a little bit

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
design to make the tutorial a little bit
faster<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.289> I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.399> using<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.480> simpler

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
faster and I think that using a simpler

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
faster and I think that using a simpler
design<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.039> square<00:00:50.340> mandalas<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.149> better

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
design in the square mandalas is better

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
design in the square mandalas is better
and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> make<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and then you can go in and make it a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.750 
and then you can go in and make it a
little<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.090> intricate<00:00:54.420> after<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.289> have

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
little more intricate after you have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.170 
little more intricate after you have
done<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> mandala<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> basic<00:00:59.129> design<00:00:59.370> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
done the mandala of the basic design and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.599 
done the mandala of the basic design and
make<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.500> fancier<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> want

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
make it a little bit fancier if you want

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.719 
make it a little bit fancier if you want
to<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:05.299> once<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.869> completed<00:01:07.530> your

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to and then once you have completed your

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
to and then once you have completed your
design<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> tracing<00:01:09.840> paper<00:01:10.549> you're<00:01:11.549> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
design on the tracing paper you're going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
design on the tracing paper you're going
to<00:01:11.850> measure<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.600> someplace<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> square

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to measure it up someplace on the square

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.920 
to measure it up someplace on the square
and<00:01:14.390> start<00:01:15.390> tracing<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.720> will

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and start tracing it and you this will

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.310 
and start tracing it and you this will
transfer<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.920> design<00:01:20.040> onto<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.810> cardstock

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
transfer the design onto the cardstock

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.460 
transfer the design onto the cardstock
and<00:01:23.189> you're<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> flip<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and you're just going to flip it and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
and you're just going to flip it and
line<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> all<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> did<00:01:28.080> with

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
line it all up just like you did with

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
line it all up just like you did with
this<00:01:28.409> circle<00:01:28.860> mandala<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.630> repeat

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this circle mandala and this will repeat

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
this circle mandala and this will repeat
the<00:01:33.780> pattern<00:01:33.990> mirroring<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:35.130> other<00:01:35.430> over

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the pattern mirroring each other over

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840 
the pattern mirroring each other over
and<00:01:36.090> over<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.450> over<00:01:36.570> again<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.790> I'm<00:01:38.790> just

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and over and over again and I'm just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.069 
and over and over again and I'm just
going<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.259> everything<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.950> my<00:01:41.189> copic

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
going back over everything with my copic

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.800 
going back over everything with my copic
multiliner<00:01:43.079> pen<00:01:44.149> darkening<00:01:45.149> everything<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
multiliner pen darkening everything in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.410 
multiliner pen darkening everything in
and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.950> every<00:01:47.250> couple<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and I like to do this every couple of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.149 
and I like to do this every couple of
wedges<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> complete<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.119> allows

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
wedges that I complete this just allows

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.010 
wedges that I complete this just allows
me<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.369> get<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.909> design<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.479> before<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
me to get the design down before it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
me to get the design down before it
smudges<00:01:55.350> too<00:01:55.740> much<00:01:55.950> after<00:01:56.250> putting<00:01:57.149> tracing

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
smudges too much after putting tracing

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.219 
smudges too much after putting tracing
paper<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.439> hands<00:01:58.799> all<00:01:58.920> over<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.229> just

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
paper and my hands all over it so just

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.760 
paper and my hands all over it so just
keep<00:02:01.560> flipping<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:03.229> measuring<00:02:04.229> everything

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
keep flipping and measuring everything

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.219 
keep flipping and measuring everything
up<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.790> exact<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.509> possible

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
up and you want to as exact as possible

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.830 
up and you want to as exact as possible
and<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.920> reason<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.280> said<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.360> better

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and the reason I said it would be better

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.040 
and the reason I said it would be better
to<00:02:09.959> have

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
to have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.890 
to have
basic<00:02:11.560> you're<00:02:11.740> going<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.750> you're<00:02:13.750> going

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
basic you're going to see you're going

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.810 
basic you're going to see you're going
to<00:02:14.050> see<00:02:14.140> towards<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> end<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.520> where<00:02:15.790> I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
to see towards the end of this where I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.230 
to see towards the end of this where I
had<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.570> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> adjust<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.820> tracing<00:02:19.210> paper

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
had to kind of adjust the tracing paper

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.100 
had to kind of adjust the tracing paper
a<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:19.750> bit<00:02:19.930> because<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.130> wasn't<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.210> didn't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
a little bit because I wasn't I didn't

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.110 
a little bit because I wasn't I didn't
measure<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.650> exactly<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.490> accident<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:27.120> if

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
measure it up exactly on accident and if

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.970 
measure it up exactly on accident and if
you<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> more<00:02:28.900> basic<00:02:29.260> design<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.830> can

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
you have a more basic design you can

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.630 
you have a more basic design you can
sort<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.400> play<00:02:30.640> with<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.940> tracing<00:02:31.510> paper<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
sort of play with the tracing paper and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.940 
sort of play with the tracing paper and
get<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.850> design<00:02:34.450> down<00:02:34.750> even<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.590> didn't

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
get the design down even if you didn't

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.710 
get the design down even if you didn't
measure<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.430> perfectly<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.090> begin<00:02:37.540> with

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
measure it up perfectly to begin with

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960 
measure it up perfectly to begin with
which<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.950> will<00:02:39.070> see<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.520> couple<00:02:39.850> minutes

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
which you will see in a couple minutes

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.450 
which you will see in a couple minutes
here<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:41.080> I'm<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.830> over<00:02:42.040> everything

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
here now I'm going over everything

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.580 
here now I'm going over everything
because<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.060> original<00:02:43.300> tracing<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.560> a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
because the original tracing was a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.000 
because the original tracing was a
little<00:02:45.100> bit<00:02:45.250> too<00:02:46.110> smudgy<00:02:47.110> at<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.530> point<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:47.980> I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
little bit too smudgy at that point so I

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460 
little bit too smudgy at that point so I
had<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> retrace<00:02:49.090> everything<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.840> instead<00:02:50.410> of

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
had to retrace everything and instead of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.410 
had to retrace everything and instead of
just<00:02:50.560> doing<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.010> little<00:02:51.130> triangle<00:02:51.640> I'm<00:02:51.940> doing<00:02:52.240> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
just doing a little triangle I'm doing a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.470 
just doing a little triangle I'm doing a
quarter<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.470> square<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.240> I'm<00:02:55.390> just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
quarter of the square here so I'm just

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.670 
quarter of the square here so I'm just
measuring<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.720> up<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.370> now<00:03:00.370> I'm<00:03:00.490> going<00:03:00.820> to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
measuring it up and now I'm going to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.190 
measuring it up and now I'm going to
trace<00:03:02.680> over<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.220> again<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.660> paper

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
trace over that again and get the paper

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.120 
trace over that again and get the paper
to<00:03:05.710> or<00:03:06.400> get<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.030> design<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:08.020> transfer<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:08.950> onto

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
to or get the design to transfer it onto

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.160 
to or get the design to transfer it onto
the<00:03:09.550> cardstock<00:03:09.820> again<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:12.630> here<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.900> see

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
the cardstock again and here you can see

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.630 
the cardstock again and here you can see
where<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.250> play<00:03:15.459> with<00:03:15.580> it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
where I'm going to have to play with it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.430 
where I'm going to have to play with it
a<00:03:15.760> little<00:03:15.970> bit<00:03:16.150> because<00:03:16.390> somehow<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.260> wasn't

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
a little bit because somehow it wasn't

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.949 
a little bit because somehow it wasn't
measured<00:03:17.890> up<00:03:18.040> perfectly<00:03:18.640> as<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.540> was<00:03:19.690> going

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
measured up perfectly as I was going

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.380 
measured up perfectly as I was going
around<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.709> I'm<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> little

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
around so I'm just going to do a little

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.830 
around so I'm just going to do a little
bit<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.840> design<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.760> then<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.150> am<00:03:25.390> going<00:03:25.720> to

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
bit of the design and then I am going to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.000 
bit of the design and then I am going to
you<00:03:26.380> can<00:03:26.530> see<00:03:26.800> right<00:03:27.550> here<00:03:28.350> I'm<00:03:29.350> measuring<00:03:29.770> it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
you can see right here I'm measuring it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.479 
you can see right here I'm measuring it
up<00:03:30.160> again<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.290> figuring<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.470> how<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.890> get

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
up again and figuring out how to get

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.790 
up again and figuring out how to get
that<00:03:33.610> design<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.120> continue<00:03:34.720> I'm<00:03:35.380> just<00:03:35.620> going

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
that design to continue I'm just going

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.650 
that design to continue I'm just going
over<00:03:36.040> everything<00:03:36.340> again<00:03:36.610> with<00:03:36.940> my<00:03:37.090> multiliner

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
over everything again with my multiliner

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.540 
over everything again with my multiliner
pen<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.260> then<00:03:38.500> I'm<00:03:38.709> going<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.010> color<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
pen and then I'm going to color it and

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.790 
pen and then I'm going to color it and
that<00:03:39.820> is<00:03:39.970> how<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> square<00:03:41.050> mandala<00:03:41.470> it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
that is how you do a square mandala it

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.610 
that is how you do a square mandala it
is<00:03:42.489> pretty<00:03:42.820> easy<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.570> said<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:44.230> is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
is pretty easy like I said this is

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.750 
is pretty easy like I said this is
better<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:46.630> basic<00:03:46.870> design<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.010> there

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
better for a more basic design and there

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000 
better for a more basic design and there
are<00:03:48.970> other<00:03:49.209> ways<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> square

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
are other ways that you can do a square

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.130 
are other ways that you can do a square
mandala<00:03:52.920> by<00:03:53.920> growing<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.610> they<00:03:54.790> call<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.140> where

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
mandala by growing it they call it where

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.080 
mandala by growing it they call it where
should<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.440> start<00:03:56.709> off<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.730> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
should you start off with the in the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.510 
should you start off with the in the
middle<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.620> just<00:03:59.980> make<00:04:00.130> designs

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
middle and you know just make designs

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.300 
middle and you know just make designs
going<00:04:00.790> outwards<00:04:01.239> but<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.810> think<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
going outwards but I think that the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.520 
going outwards but I think that the
tracing<00:04:03.820> paper<00:04:03.850> is<00:04:04.360> actually<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.050> easiest

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
tracing paper is actually the easiest

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.100 
tracing paper is actually the easiest
way<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.400> go<00:04:06.550> about<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.970> now<00:04:07.300> I'm<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.570> erasing

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
way to go about it now I'm just erasing

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.199 
way to go about it now I'm just erasing
everything<00:04:08.440> because<00:04:09.040> there's<00:04:09.670> pencil<00:04:10.030> lines

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
everything because there's pencil lines

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.479 
everything because there's pencil lines
all<00:04:10.510> over<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.780> place<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.380> I'm<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.190> going<00:04:12.370> to

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
all over the place and I'm just going to

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.310 
all over the place and I'm just going to
color<00:04:12.730> everything<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.840> didn't<00:04:14.200> make

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
color everything in and I didn't make

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.460 
color everything in and I didn't make
more<00:04:14.560> designs<00:04:14.950> inside<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:16.780> for<00:04:16.989> tutorial

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
more designs inside just for tutorial

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.490 
more designs inside just for tutorial
purposes<00:04:17.500> but<00:04:18.220> if<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.489> was<00:04:18.669> making<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.539> my

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
purposes but if I was making this on my

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.110 
purposes but if I was making this on my
own<00:04:20.710> to<00:04:21.010> show<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:22.090> regular<00:04:22.510> art

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
own to show just a regular art

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.110 
own to show just a regular art
design<00:04:23.449> I<00:04:24.139> probably<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:25.250> definitely<00:04:25.970> would

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
design I probably I definitely would

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.480 
design I probably I definitely would
have<00:04:26.150> gone<00:04:26.419> in<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.810> made<00:04:27.590> little<00:04:27.740> designs<00:04:28.220> in

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
have gone in and made little designs in

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.070 
have gone in and made little designs in
each<00:04:28.639> one<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:29.000> those<00:04:29.090> little<00:04:29.330> segments<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.050> I

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
each one of those little segments that I

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.140 
each one of those little segments that I
created<00:04:30.530> with<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> tracing<00:04:31.580> paper<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.930> yeah

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
created with the tracing paper but yeah

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.210 
created with the tracing paper but yeah
so<00:04:35.150> that's<00:04:35.300> about<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.810> for<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.650> square

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
so that's about it for the square

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.030 
so that's about it for the square
mandala<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:38.120> all<00:04:38.570> together<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:39.169> take<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.710> this

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
mandala it all together it take it this

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.760 
mandala it all together it take it this
one<00:04:40.280> which<00:04:40.550> was<00:04:40.760> 5<00:04:41.000> inches<00:04:41.210> by<00:04:41.389> 5<00:04:41.720> inches

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
one which was 5 inches by 5 inches

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.170 
one which was 5 inches by 5 inches
really<00:04:42.770> took<00:04:43.010> about<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.280> half<00:04:43.520> an<00:04:43.669> hour<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.120> it

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
really took about a half an hour so it

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.060 
really took about a half an hour so it
didn't<00:04:44.389> take<00:04:44.510> very<00:04:44.540> long<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.350> like<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.010> said

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
didn't take very long and like I said

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.570 
didn't take very long and like I said
this<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> very<00:04:46.760> simple<00:04:47.120> design<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.130> I

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580
