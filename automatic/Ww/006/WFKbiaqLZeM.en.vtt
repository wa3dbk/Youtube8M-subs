you look at the age range of 40 and over

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.400 
you look at the age range of 40 and over
I'd<00:00:28.650> say<00:00:28.920> approximately<00:00:29.400> 60%<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.840> women<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I'd say approximately 60% of women you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220 
I'd say approximately 60% of women you
can<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.880> bulging<00:00:33.420> blue<00:00:33.719> vein<00:00:34.050> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
can see kind of a bulging blue vein that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
can see kind of a bulging blue vein that
might<00:00:34.440> appear<00:00:34.800> under<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> eye<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
might appear under the eye or up in the

might appear under the eye or up in the
temple<00:00:36.570> region<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> most<00:00:37.950> common

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
temple region and that's the most common

temple region and that's the most common
area<00:00:38.640> yeah<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> most<00:00:39.480> common<00:00:39.629> area

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
area yeah that's the most common area

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
area yeah that's the most common area
and<00:00:40.200> does<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> range<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.910> gender<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.390> race<00:00:42.870> and

and does it range in gender and race and
that<00:00:43.350> sort<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> thing<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.100> everybody<00:00:44.550> get

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that sort of thing does everybody get

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
that sort of thing does everybody get
this<00:00:44.940> eventually<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.870> no<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.410> everyone<00:00:46.710> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this eventually or no not everyone but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
this eventually or no not everyone but
it's<00:00:47.190> similar<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> leg<00:00:47.969> veins<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> it's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's similar to leg veins in that it's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's similar to leg veins in that it's
predominantly<00:00:49.410> seen<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> women<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.850> what

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
predominantly seen in women and what

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
predominantly seen in women and what
happens<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.809> older<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> skin

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
happens as we get older is the skin

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
happens as we get older is the skin
starts<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> thin<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> temple<00:00:54.180> area

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
starts to thin out in the temple area

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
starts to thin out in the temple area
and<00:00:54.420> around<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> eye<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.829> vessels<00:00:56.250> start

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and around the eye and the vessels start

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
and around the eye and the vessels start
to<00:00:56.579> dilate<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.270> larger<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.260> they

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to dilate or get larger just like they

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.840 
to dilate or get larger just like they
do<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> leg<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.430> course<00:00:59.609> they

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
do in the leg so they of course they

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.209 
do in the leg so they of course they
become<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.660> noticeable<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.800> other<00:01:01.949> thing

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
become more noticeable the other thing

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.149 
become more noticeable the other thing
is<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.030> fat<00:01:03.300> layer<00:01:03.600> between<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.470> skin

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
is the the fat layer between the skin

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
is the the fat layer between the skin
and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.519> vessel<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.330> starts<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> shrink<00:01:07.140> as

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and the vessel that starts to shrink as

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.109 
and the vessel that starts to shrink as
we<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.560> older<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.830> again<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> vessel<00:01:08.850> becomes

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
we get older so again the vessel becomes

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
we get older so again the vessel becomes
more<00:01:09.270> prominent<00:01:09.600> seems<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> unfair<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
more prominent seems so unfair that the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
more prominent seems so unfair that the
fat<00:01:11.610> shrinks<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.420> her<00:01:12.540> face<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.740> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
fat shrinks on her face but not where we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
fat shrinks on her face but not where we
need<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.970> let's<00:01:15.299> talk<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.509> how

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
need it right well let's talk about how

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
need it right well let's talk about how
you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.229> treat<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> doesn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you can treat this because it doesn't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
you can treat this because it doesn't
sound<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.759> something<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.479> run

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
sound like something you can just run

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
sound like something you can just run
out<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:18.990> buy<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> lotion<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> cream<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.700> know

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
out and buy a lotion or a cream for know

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670 
out and buy a lotion or a cream for know
this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.020> lotions<00:01:22.560> and

this is one thing that lotions and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
this is one thing that lotions and
creams<00:01:22.830> definitely<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.490> work<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
creams definitely don't work for but the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600

side<00:01:31.170> usually<00:01:31.829> takes<00:01:32.100> only<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.729> minute

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
side usually takes only about a minute

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
side usually takes only about a minute
to<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:33.270> minutes<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> patient

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to two minutes and then this patient

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.289 
to two minutes and then this patient
here<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> quick

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
here you can see that's it's that quick

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
here you can see that's it's that quick
of<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> result<00:01:36.960> yeah<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.439> before<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
of a result yeah that's before and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
of a result yeah that's before and
that's<00:01:38.130> ten<00:01:38.460> minutes<00:01:38.729> after<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> treated<00:01:39.390> her

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's ten minutes after I treated her

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
that's ten minutes after I treated her
so<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> results<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.979> instant

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so you can see the results are instant

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.420 
so you can see the results are instant
how<00:01:42.119> long<00:01:42.299> does<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.509> last<00:01:42.799> years<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.040> fact<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
how long does it last years in fact I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
how long does it last years in fact I
haven't<00:01:44.610> seen<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.090> come<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:45.689> yet<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
haven't seen one come back yet now this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
haven't seen one come back yet now this
is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> younger<00:01:47.159> girl<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> younger

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
is a younger girl and in the younger

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.910 
is a younger girl and in the younger
patient<00:01:48.479> population<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.710> more

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
patient population you can see it's more

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800 
patient population you can see it's more
commonly<00:01:50.340> seen<00:01:50.430> under<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> eye<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.659> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
commonly seen under the eye now this is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
commonly seen under the eye now this is
an<00:01:51.930> older<00:01:52.170> patient<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.579> how

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
an older patient and you can see how

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490 
an older patient and you can see how
that<00:01:53.970> vessel<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.229> going

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that vessel when it's when it's going

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
that vessel when it's when it's going
and<00:01:55.619> treated<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.130> much<00:01:56.310> better<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.790> area

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and treated how much better that area

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
and treated how much better that area
looks<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.540> looks<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.079> youthful<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
looks it this looks more youthful so

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.709 
looks it this looks more youthful so
tell<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.399> how<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> feel<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.420> apply

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
tell me how does it feel when you apply

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.590 
tell me how does it feel when you apply
the<00:02:00.780> laser<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.070> exactly

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the laser and what does it do exactly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
the laser and what does it do exactly
that's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> good<00:02:03.780> question<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.530> happens<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that's a good question what happens is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679 
that's a good question what happens is
when<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> fire<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> laser<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.240> first<00:02:06.479> thing

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
when I fire the laser the first thing

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
when I fire the laser the first thing
that<00:02:06.719> happens<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> cold<00:02:07.680> spray<00:02:08.190> comes<00:02:08.520> out

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that happens is a cold spray comes out

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
that happens is a cold spray comes out
now<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> spray<00:02:09.780> protects<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> top<00:02:10.770> layers

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
now that spray protects the top layers

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.320 
now that spray protects the top layers
of<00:02:11.160> skin<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.790> then<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> split<00:02:12.360> second<00:02:12.840> later

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
of skin and then a split second later

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.570 
of skin and then a split second later
the<00:02:13.390> laser<00:02:13.600> fires<00:02:14.050> passes<00:02:14.980> through<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> skin

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the laser fires passes through the skin

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.520 
the laser fires passes through the skin
without<00:02:15.760> injuring<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.390> skin<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.900> goes<00:02:17.350> right

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
without injuring the skin and goes right

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.590 
without injuring the skin and goes right
into<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.950> vessel<00:02:18.370> now<00:02:18.580> what<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.210> does<00:02:19.420> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
into the vessel now what that does it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.270 
into the vessel now what that does it
causes<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.110> best<00:02:20.290> sort<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.530> closed<00:02:20.860> down<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
causes the best sort of closed down and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.060 
causes the best sort of closed down and
collapse<00:02:21.790> upon<00:02:22.000> itself<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:23.010> thereby<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
collapse upon itself and thereby the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.830 
collapse upon itself and thereby the
vessel<00:02:24.610> shrinks<00:02:24.970> instantly<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.660> then<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
vessel shrinks instantly and then the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360 
vessel shrinks instantly and then the
body<00:02:26.080> over<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> period<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.980> few<00:02:27.040> weeks

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
body over a period of a few weeks

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.490 
body over a period of a few weeks
absorbs<00:02:27.910> what's<00:02:28.390> left<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> vessel<00:02:29.230> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
absorbs what's left of the vessel are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.710 
absorbs what's left of the vessel are
there<00:02:29.650> any<00:02:29.770> side<00:02:30.010> effects<00:02:30.340> only<00:02:31.150> what<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.570> saw

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
there any side effects only what you saw

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
there any side effects only what you saw
on<00:02:31.750> those<00:02:31.960> photos<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.440> immediately<00:02:33.040> after

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
on those photos there immediately after

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.680 
on those photos there immediately after
you<00:02:33.490> get<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> little<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.060> swelling<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
you get a little bit of swelling and a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.090 
you get a little bit of swelling and a
little<00:02:34.900> bit<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.110> redness<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.040> is

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
little bit of redness but really this is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.830 
little bit of redness but really this is
a<00:02:36.220> truly<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.700> procedure<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.300> can<00:02:37.480> go<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:37.780> back

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
a truly a procedure we can go right back

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.710 
a truly a procedure we can go right back
to<00:02:38.200> work<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.770> what's<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.220> cost<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:40.240> cost<00:02:40.270> for

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
to work and what's the cost the cost for

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350 
to work and what's the cost the cost for
doing<00:02:40.770> both<00:02:41.770> sides<00:02:42.160> would<00:02:42.580> be<00:02:42.910> anywhere<00:02:43.300> from

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
doing both sides would be anywhere from

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.140 
doing both sides would be anywhere from
600<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.200> 900<00:02:44.440> dollars<00:02:44.890> they're<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.490> bad<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
600 to 900 dollars they're not bad for a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.610 
600 to 900 dollars they're not bad for a
procedure<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:46.900> makes<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.440> dramatic

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
procedure I think makes a dramatic

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.650 
procedure I think makes a dramatic
difference<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.490> appearance<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.240> does<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
difference in the appearance and does it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.930 
difference in the appearance and does it
diminish<00:02:50.050> any<00:02:50.230> other<00:02:50.590> wrinkles<00:02:51.130> or<00:02:51.370> unsightly

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
diminish any other wrinkles or unsightly

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.840 
diminish any other wrinkles or unsightly
things<00:02:52.270> we<00:02:52.420> don't<00:02:52.600> want<00:02:58.920> Happy<00:02:59.920> New<00:02:59.950> Year<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
things we don't want Happy New Year and

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.910 
things we don't want Happy New Year and
let's<00:03:01.150> throw<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.450> over<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.690> Lorne<00:03:01.990> instant

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
let's throw it over to Lorne instant

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.449 
let's throw it over to Lorne instant
