commercials or even film footage so for

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.720 
commercials or even film footage so for
$200<00:01:20.810> that's<00:01:21.230> basically<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.890> still<00:01:22.250> compared

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
$200 that's basically I still compared

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.560 
$200 that's basically I still compared
to<00:01:22.850> saw<00:01:23.030> flex<00:01:23.330> which<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:24.140> guess<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.040> like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
to saw flex which is I guess is like

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.719 
to saw flex which is I guess is like
$3,000<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:26.800> so<00:01:29.140> $200<00:01:30.400> for<00:01:31.400> better

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
$3,000 now so $200 for better

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.250 
$3,000 now so $200 for better
information<00:01:32.450> then<00:01:34.240> saw<00:01:35.240> flex<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.750> very<00:01:36.020> very

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
information then saw flex is very very

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.310 
information then saw flex is very very
good<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:39.229> course<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.130> i<00:01:40.190> flicks<00:01:40.490> has<00:01:41.320> benefits

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
good of course so i flicks has benefits

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.100 
good of course so i flicks has benefits
as<00:01:42.470> well<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:42.950> uh<00:01:45.580> well<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:47.540> somewhat

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
as well but uh well it is somewhat

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.900 
as well but uh well it is somewhat
limited<00:01:48.500> because<00:01:48.650> it's<00:01:49.100> actually<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
limited because it's actually at the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.140 
limited because it's actually at the
former<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.290> actually<00:01:52.040> doesn't<00:01:52.250> calculate

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
former and it actually doesn't calculate

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.660 
former and it actually doesn't calculate
cloth<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.020> way<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.380> most<00:01:57.860> cloth

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
cloth in the way that most cloth

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.270 
cloth in the way that most cloth
simulators<00:01:59.660> would<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.560> way<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.800> create

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
simulators would the way you create

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.180 
simulators would the way you create
cloth<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:05.290> well<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.470> basically<00:02:06.590> do<00:02:06.950> what<00:02:07.159> a

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
cloth is well you basically do what a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460 
cloth is well you basically do what a
tailor<00:02:07.610> would<00:02:07.820> do<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.540> just<00:02:08.780> create<00:02:09.350> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
tailor would do you just create the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.020 
tailor would do you just create the
pieces<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:11.739> Marla's<00:02:12.739> designer<00:02:13.100> will<00:02:13.370> put

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
pieces then Marla's designer will put

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.160 
pieces then Marla's designer will put
this<00:02:14.410> piece<00:02:15.410> together<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.050> great

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.470 

home<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.790> pretty<00:02:22.940> much<00:02:23.150> straightforward

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
home so it's pretty much straightforward

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.400 
home so it's pretty much straightforward
the<00:02:24.470> bad<00:02:24.650> thing<00:02:24.890> about<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.780> you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the bad thing about this is that you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.979 
the bad thing about this is that you
cannot<00:02:27.769> create<00:02:28.310> cloth<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.090> modeler<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.750> then

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
cannot create cloth and modeler and then

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.229 
cannot create cloth and modeler and then
imported<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.680> mark<00:02:30.920> marvelous<00:02:31.430> designer<00:02:31.850> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
imported to mark marvelous designer that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:40.320 
imported to mark marvelous designer that
will<00:02:32.390> not<00:02:32.570> work<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.480> import<00:02:38.560> deformed

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
will not work you can import deformed

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
will not work you can import deformed
MDD<00:02:41.330> characters<00:02:41.870> though<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.220> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
MDD characters though so you can have a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
MDD characters though so you can have a
person<00:02:44.239> walking<00:02:44.510> or<00:02:44.840> whatever<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.590> put

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
person walking or whatever and that put

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.250 
person walking or whatever and that put
on<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.370> cloth<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.570> made<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.870> Marvelous

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
on the cloth that you made in Marvelous

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.190 
on the cloth that you made in Marvelous
Designer<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.120> if<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.299> have<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> guy<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.989> you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
Designer so if you have a guy that you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.470 
Designer so if you have a guy that you
made<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.560> like<00:02:51.739> me<00:02:51.890> running<00:02:52.100> around<00:02:52.480> naked

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
made in like me running around naked

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.620 
made in like me running around naked
essentially<00:02:54.700> then<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.790> can<00:02:55.940> put<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> cloth<00:02:56.390> on

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
essentially then you can put a cloth on

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
essentially then you can put a cloth on
that<00:02:56.900> guy<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.350> Marla's<00:02:57.680> designer<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.280> export

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
that guy in Marla's designer and export

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.260 
that guy in Marla's designer and export
it<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.959> lightweight<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.920> render

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.180 

now<00:03:07.270> this<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.690> made<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.110> another<00:03:08.440> package<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
now this is made in another package I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.280 
now this is made in another package I
believe<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:09.640> Maya<00:03:09.880> or<00:03:10.150> something<00:03:10.420> like<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
believe it's Maya or something like that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.080 
believe it's Maya or something like that
Marvelous<00:03:11.980> Designer<00:03:12.010> will<00:03:12.580> not<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.910> able<00:03:13.030> to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
Marvelous Designer will not be able to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.010 
Marvelous Designer will not be able to
do<00:03:13.300> this<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.840> will<00:03:13.960> not<00:03:14.020> be<00:03:14.350> able<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:16.020> create

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
do this it will not be able to create

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.060 
do this it will not be able to create
muscle<00:03:17.320> assimilation<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.680> could<00:03:23.890> very

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
muscle assimilation but it could very

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.090 
muscle assimilation but it could very
well<00:03:24.130> be<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.460> lightweight<00:03:25.470> 11.5<00:03:26.470> could<00:03:26.920> do

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
well be that lightweight 11.5 could do

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.880 
well be that lightweight 11.5 could do
this<00:03:27.280> as<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.510> has<00:03:29.320> introduced

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
this as it actually has introduced

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.930 
this as it actually has introduced
bullet<00:03:30.790> soft<00:03:31.060> bodies<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:33.520> should<00:03:33.820> be

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
bullet soft bodies and that should be

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.150 
bullet soft bodies and that should be
quite<00:03:34.090> good<00:03:34.180> for<00:03:34.530> creating<00:03:35.530> these<00:03:35.680> kind<00:03:36.070> of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
quite good for creating these kind of

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.270 
quite good for creating these kind of
simulations<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.870> problem<00:03:41.380> area<00:03:41.740> is<00:03:42.010> actually

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
simulations the problem area is actually

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.520 
simulations the problem area is actually
where<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.480> problem<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.050> actually<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
where the the problem is actually the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.000 
where the the problem is actually the
skin<00:03:45.000> how<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.060> get<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.710> skin<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.740> deform

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
skin how you get the skin to deform

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:58.890 
skin how you get the skin to deform
based<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.340> muscles<00:03:51.730> well<00:03:56.790> probably<00:03:57.900> the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
based on the muscles well probably the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
based on the muscles well probably the
good<00:03:59.260> thing<00:03:59.530> or<00:03:59.860> or<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.520> way<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.700> do<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.210> to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
good thing or or the way to do it is to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.650 
good thing or or the way to do it is to
create<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.650> muscles<00:04:06.100> using<00:04:06.910> soft<00:04:07.210> bodies<00:04:07.570> and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
create the muscles using soft bodies and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.150 
create the muscles using soft bodies and
then<00:04:10.660> calculate<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.160> then<00:04:13.740> on<00:04:14.740> top<00:04:15.100> of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
then calculate that and then on top of

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.729 
then calculate that and then on top of
that<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.610> could<00:04:15.730> probably<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.390> soft<00:04:16.780> body

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.050 

deformer<00:04:20.770> so<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.459> skin<00:04:21.760> can<00:04:22.030> actually

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
deformer so that the skin can actually

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
deformer so that the skin can actually
be<00:04:22.980> soft<00:04:23.980> bodies<00:04:24.310> too

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
be soft bodies too

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.380 
be soft bodies too
so<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.800> muscles<00:04:27.190> are<00:04:27.340> soft<00:04:27.580> bodies<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.210> then

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
so the muscles are soft bodies and then

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.020 
so the muscles are soft bodies and then
the<00:04:28.990> skin<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.440> soft<00:04:29.740> bodies<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.669> will<00:04:30.820> get

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
the skin is soft bodies so you will get

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.470 
the skin is soft bodies so you will get
these<00:04:31.890> reacting<00:04:32.890> together<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:36.480> supposedly

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
these reacting together and supposedly

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.060 
these reacting together and supposedly
bullet<00:04:39.150> soft<00:04:40.150> bodies<00:04:40.480> should<00:04:41.169> do<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.770> very

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
bullet soft bodies should do that very

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.510 
bullet soft bodies should do that very
very<00:04:42.280> good<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.760> that's<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.750> possibility<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
very good so that's a possibility the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.430 
very good so that's a possibility the
other<00:04:48.640> possibility<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.390> use<00:04:49.600> soft<00:04:50.140> bodies

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
other possibility is to use soft bodies

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.030 
other possibility is to use soft bodies
on<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.610> muscles<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.300> something<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.169> ko

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
on the muscles and something like ko

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.700 
on the muscles and something like ko
poly<00:04:54.669> fit<00:04:54.970> on<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:56.050> skin<00:04:56.380> or<00:04:56.880> deepens<00:04:58.710> boolean

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
poly fit on the skin or deepens boolean

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.070 
poly fit on the skin or deepens boolean
plugin<00:05:00.280> for<00:05:01.210> layout

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.969 

now<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:08.520> haven't<00:05:09.090> tested<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:09.750> well<00:05:10.409> well<00:05:10.949> I

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
now I haven't tested it so well well I

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:21.170 
now I haven't tested it so well well I
have<00:05:11.159> to<00:05:11.280> see<00:05:11.460> really<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:16.530> again<00:05:19.819> $200<00:05:20.819> for

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
have to see really but again $200 for

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:47.080 
have to see really but again $200 for
cloth<00:05:21.659> like<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:22.530> very<00:05:23.419> good

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.580 

yeah<00:05:47.539> I<00:05:47.569> think<00:05:47.780> I'm<00:05:47.900> just<00:05:47.960> gonna<00:05:48.229> leave<00:05:48.319> it<00:05:48.470> at

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
yeah I think I'm just gonna leave it at

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:57.899 
yeah I think I'm just gonna leave it at
that<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:50.530> let<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.560> two<00:05:51.919> last<00:05:52.220> videos<00:05:52.340> play

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.909 

there's<00:05:58.909> a<00:05:59.000> limitation<00:05:59.719> in<00:05:59.919> Marvelous

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
there's a limitation in Marvelous

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.809 
there's a limitation in Marvelous
Designer<00:06:00.949> and<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:03.110> cloth<00:06:04.000> resolution<00:06:05.000> is

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
Designer and the cloth resolution is

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.320 
Designer and the cloth resolution is
limited<00:06:07.819> so<00:06:08.750> just<00:06:09.259> be<00:06:09.379> aware<00:06:09.409> of<00:06:09.650> that<00:06:10.330> there

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
limited so just be aware of that there

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.610 
limited so just be aware of that there
is<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.509> trick<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:12.759> fix<00:06:13.759> that<00:06:14.090> or<00:06:14.870> go<00:06:15.080> around<00:06:15.199> that

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
is a trick to fix that or go around that

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.920 
is a trick to fix that or go around that
by<00:06:15.770> using<00:06:15.949> meta<00:06:16.340> link<00:06:16.580> but<00:06:16.849> that's<00:06:17.270> another

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
by using meta link but that's another

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.290 
by using meta link but that's another
story<00:06:18.710> but<00:06:20.919> as<00:06:21.919> you<00:06:22.039> can<00:06:22.159> see<00:06:22.280> there's<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.729> high

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
story but as you can see there's a high

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.479 
story but as you can see there's a high
detail<00:06:23.719> here<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:25.580> should<00:06:25.849> be<00:06:25.909> good<00:06:26.060> enough
