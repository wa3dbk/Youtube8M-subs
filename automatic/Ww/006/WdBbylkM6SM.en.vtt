your mini-map and everything else in
your<00:00:50.070> map<00:00:50.280> settings<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> an

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your map settings so this is an

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.709 
your map settings so this is an
important<00:00:53.250> fact<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.030> i've<00:00:54.149> been<00:00:54.180> playing

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
important fact that i've been playing

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.299 
important fact that i've been playing
without<00:00:55.399> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> last<00:00:57.050> 19<00:00:58.050> days<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.800> gameplay

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
without for the last 19 days of gameplay

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.860 
without for the last 19 days of gameplay
I've<00:00:59.430> been<00:00:59.670> playing<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.180> mini<00:01:00.390> map<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I've been playing with my mini map in a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.609 
I've been playing with my mini map in a
far<00:01:01.109> left-hand<00:01:01.500> corner<00:01:02.039> which<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
far left-hand corner which is it's a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.670 
far left-hand corner which is it's a
handicap<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.360> important<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.229> you're

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
handicap so it's important if you're

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
handicap so it's important if you're

disguise<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:25.470> wean<00:01:25.950> myself<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.970> old<00:01:27.119> style

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
disguise I wean myself off the old style

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.280 
disguise I wean myself off the old style
of<00:01:27.689> ecology<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.650> style<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.280> mini<00:01:29.579> map<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
of ecology for style of mini map and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.990 
of ecology for style of mini map and
maybe<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.799> don't<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> very<00:01:33.360> big

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
maybe I don't know this is a very big

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
maybe I don't know this is a very big
I'm<00:01:36.000> curious<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.780> missed<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.470> bluntly

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I'm curious how I missed it so bluntly

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.569 
I'm curious how I missed it so bluntly
but<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> mini-map<00:01:41.369> is

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
but and also you can see the mini-map is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.810 
but and also you can see the mini-map is
transparent<00:01:42.409> versus<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> call<00:01:43.950> before<00:01:44.280> which

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
transparent versus a call before which

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
transparent versus a call before which
really<00:01:45.810> wasn't<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.500> transparent<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
really wasn't that as transparent as

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
really wasn't that as transparent as
this<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:48.420> sometimes<00:01:48.840> maybe<00:01:49.320> throw<00:01:49.680> might

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this which sometimes maybe throw might

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
this which sometimes maybe throw might
throw<00:01:50.460> off<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.640> game<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> didn't

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
throw off your game and see I didn't

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
throw off your game and see I didn't
point<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> last<00:01:52.829> video<00:01:53.009> being

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
point that out in the last video being

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
point that out in the last video being
that<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> mini-map<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.170> transparent<00:01:55.649> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that the mini-map is not transparent in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
that the mini-map is not transparent in
