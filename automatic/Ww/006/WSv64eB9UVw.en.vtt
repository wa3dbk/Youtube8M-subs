at<00:02:42.049> any<00:02:42.200> field<00:02:42.440> really<00:02:42.859> take<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.129> real

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
at any field really take a real

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.619 
at any field really take a real
inventory<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.910> what<00:02:44.269> you're<00:02:44.359> bringing<00:02:44.569> the

inventory of what you're bringing the

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.710 
inventory of what you're bringing the
table<00:02:45.790> because<00:02:46.790> that's<00:02:47.030> going<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.359> be<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.510> big

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
table because that's going to be a big

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.080 
table because that's going to be a big
factor<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.379> how<00:02:48.620> difficult<00:02:49.129> your<00:02:49.310> path<00:02:49.940> is

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
factor and how difficult your path is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.250 
factor and how difficult your path is
going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.239> be<00:02:50.299> right<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.849> know<00:02:53.260> Spencer

going to be right and you know Spencer

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.130 
going to be right and you know Spencer
but<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.940> it's<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.359> personality<00:02:59.720> thing<00:02:59.989> is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
but I think it's a personality thing is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.990 
but I think it's a personality thing is
huge<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.560> don't<00:03:00.590> think<00:03:00.890> people<00:03:00.980> realize<00:03:01.370> how
