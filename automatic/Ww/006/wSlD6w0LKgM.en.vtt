00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 in this episode of the heart liver tv 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.160
 the hp specter xt 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 welcome to hearts info tv if you hp 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 ask for the ultimate laptop 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 consumers then they come back more here 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 the hp specter xt 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 based on their most luxurious ultrabook 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 windows 8 and only to see it 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.000
 really a very nice device yes you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.349
 it also immediately sees a nice aluminum 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 finish nice slim year that fits 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 also a bit on that ultrabook 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.520
 label 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
 it's a 15-inch model that is on 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 is however particularly for the boxing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.629
 because yes it was actually the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.520
 most ultrabooks 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 except for example this and spruce and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 3 that were all 1314 something 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 model sometimes there is an idea and therefore the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.260
 compact compact emergency booklets 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 and here I actually want that standard 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.649
 15 inch screen yes because what vi so 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.120
 that is special 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.500
 to yet again that appearance by 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 Peter really did just that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 own things has invented how aluminum 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have seen it before but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.989
 example the shiny edge yes it is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
 really just a device with green 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.380
 a very own look and absolutely none 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 copy before it is right as a leader and yes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.560
 it seems it also fits in very 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 the cell very much in the style of the van 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 the other consumer models of one 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.689
 of the brand it is obvious it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 top model and I had a bit of it myself 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.700
 pity think it is sees it too 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 assassins tap ultrabook and like you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 compares him with others 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.799
 15 inch notebooks yes then you know 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 just as much hotter are also more 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.119
 notebooks that weigh around 2.25 kilos 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.290
 also 15 inch screen do you have 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 have nothing in design label 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.409
 So it actually means because 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.670
 there is he then put you see the sticker 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.530
 and you would expect this one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.329
 be lighter than a thirteen in one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.439
 a dozen 15 inch laptop and you were used to 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.240
 not the case but there is one that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.590
 heavy me sit you now live no yes it is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 it is basically nothing special for that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.710
 for for for for this screen format 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 Obviously there are heavier ones and there are 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.979
 a few lighter ones available but yes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.210
 we think there is nothing special about it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.560
 well look when you look at the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.610
 specifications well it is one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 tribute book so there is such a century 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.630
 ultra-efficient intel core i5 processor 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.149
 yes yes ran 3317 from which it is a beer 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.640
 on many occasions over all look how 4 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.290
 gigabyte of memory 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 since that in itself is nothing and nothing 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.740
 especially the yes in itself it is one 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.690
 machine that you are fine with 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.670
 feet can but in terms of specifications you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.980
 not so very special 500 gigabytes 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.870
 hard disk with 32 gigabyte boot 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.360
 memory and 6 were added 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 yes in itself and and a standard notebook 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.110
 but well hp position this as the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.670
 ultimate goal hit corner so then it must be 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.900
 something else special like a year 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.360
 and you can see that a bit 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.820
 screen because is an eps 1920 flat screen 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.290
 1080 and a touch pad 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.090
 screen well that is that is natural 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.709
 certainly with windows 8 is one in the in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.370
 that is a very bad thought 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.770
 special 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.290
 yes and soot screens too because watch how 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.180
 true colors knocking sometimes yes weapon 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.800
 actually no great trackpad here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.540
 has screens as far as we are concerned 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.310
 this is true extradition to line yes 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 and there they are lying for beats 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.489
 audio on well and the speakers 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.410
 also sound best for this device 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.510
 nice which also makes him very special 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.170
 is that see here on the side there 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.470
 here to an HDMI connection and one 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.420
 display port 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.459
 when the bomb connection even you 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.769
 so both a screen can connect to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.720
 but also and a tulip bulb the device 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.579
 yes and then the i tied in the apple 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.650
 world is already fully established but 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.970
 in the windows world is always again 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.440
 app special if we need the pot 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.660
 connection against a laptop 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.940
 yes and that means it and the ball 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.890
 a combination between display port and pci 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.810
 express and then you can use your device 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.390
 connect to one at a high speed 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.160
 yes it is always the last wind you see 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.000
 with windows devices with then the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.380
 pound it is it is that sometimes just 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.989
 certified devices work a little 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.880
 by each means that there is already none of it 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.829
 you can get them cat kit equipment and then 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.480
 the choice becomes even smaller, yes 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.579
 and that it really comes 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.410
 that you actually yes a few 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.140
 hands full of devices and then often 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 sometimes very professional audio video 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.530
 equipment that you can connect to this 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 but yes if you really are where you are 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.220
 think well then you can if 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.410
 consumers really benefit from it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.360
 speed can also be achieved yes there is not 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.450
 very much for sale an example is this 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.660
 worked from formation that is an external 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.700
 drive with a c400 maicon and set them up 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.950
 on board 100 in gigabytes but large 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.670
 both and then that was that the oil and 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.130
 version of the m4 egg 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.829
 yes of the course of crucial there they are 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.419
 a tunnel bolt connection to and and and 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.280
 a usb connection 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.230
 yes and you can then via thunderbolt 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.540
 connection yes you actually see 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.650
 that the speed via usb 3 point 0 and four 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.660
 then the bol well 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.850
 roughly equal yes that is in itself 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.100
 understandable because yes usb 3 pin us 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.070
 also climate up to around 480 mbps 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.600
 yes well dunnewold it is over 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.590
 you must always blast it actually 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.910
 a little conclude it 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.169
 mainly in investment in the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.610
 future is because 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.050
 probably a lot will go in the future 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.760
 more from the device for years 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.650
 but not really a little bit of searching 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 yes and there are few devices that are 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.590
 really just that full bandwidth 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.870
 on the windows platform want 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.010
 your model to order a turban device 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.720
 to be able to use this on this 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.460
 device that is it must be such a device 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.560
 non- honed certifier 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.120
 can use devices to make you the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.500
 specific driver's that have that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.600
 support that are only with the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.710
 manufacturer of the device and 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.190
 in this case it shows them though 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.050
 available 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.080
 yes well if we just take the balance 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.540
 make up what these aspects xt actually 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.160
 differs from the 13 and is through 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.930
 holterhoek then that is that then the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.890
 sphere between the full hd screen 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.229
 We are 15 inch touch and yes press the the 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.789
 in terms of looks green excellent finish yes and 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.960
 if i do that then a little bit aneke 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.050
 add it then I think it is a bit 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.360
 pricey cost 1495 euros on average in yes 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.520
 and that is what is offered for yes 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.729
 is that on the high side yes because if 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.979
 we look at pigeons for yes before 1495 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.940
 euro you and I buy pretty much every 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.160
 other ultrabook 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.410
 yes but also a macbook pro for example 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.970
 with retina screen and then no whole 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.440
 close but can be nice 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.330
 the neighborhood year in a few very nice 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.039
 buy machines from hazes and tai chi ' 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.479
 for example or and transform book that 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.380
 are about as well as a mount for 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.270
 fit that price 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.500
 yes so in the city ​​is actually in in in 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.030
 in in in 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.190
 like when the windows world look 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.050
 towns at this price level absolutely not 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.640
 not particularly yes and if you extended it 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.140
 with apple world would make the crisis as 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.830
 choose between winning he touch or do you have 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.020
 rather 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.370
 that much higher resolution and that is 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.260
 then a trade-off that you have to make yourself 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.580
 but your hp also shows that 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.590
 they can make something special and 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.169
 with that we conclude this episode of 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.210
 heart liver tv we will be every monday 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.410
 Wednesday and Friday with new ones 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.970
 episodes 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.060
 thanks again for watching the 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.760
 last time 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.100
 energy yes and was really a big one 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.600
 much noisy than this card and that 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.790
 or official 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.560
 7990 is just faster than we are 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.410
 have they put side by side left 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.810
 by those unofficial of power war and 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.639
 club3d the richest official then we see 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.919
