telling<00:00:13.480> you<00:00:13.570> about<00:00:13.599> the<00:00:13.960> terrain<00:00:14.259> generation

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
telling you about the terrain generation

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.580 
telling you about the terrain generation
changes<00:00:15.370> because<00:00:15.820> it's<00:00:16.720> become<00:00:17.110> apparent<00:00:17.230> to

comments area saying like how the

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.730 
comments area saying like how the
terrain<00:00:24.520> generate<00:00:24.940> has<00:00:25.090> changed<00:00:25.510> but<00:00:26.440> yeah<00:00:26.590> it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
terrain generate has changed but yeah it

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.870 
terrain generate has changed but yeah it
has<00:00:26.890> hey<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.810> if<00:00:29.140> you're<00:00:29.290> using<00:00:29.560> version<00:00:29.920> 1.7

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
has hey so if you're using version 1.7

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.570 
has hey so if you're using version 1.7
point<00:00:31.210> 3<00:00:31.390> all<00:00:31.660> below<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.619> will<00:00:32.650> probably<00:00:33.190> know

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
point 3 all below you will probably know

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.490 
point 3 all below you will probably know
that<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.880> terrain<00:00:34.210> generator<00:00:34.630> in<00:00:34.990> my<00:00:35.230> opinion

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
that the terrain generator in my opinion

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.150 
that the terrain generator in my opinion
is<00:00:35.740> better<00:00:36.040> than<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.770> 1.8<00:00:38.770> or<00:00:38.920> later

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
is better than that of 1.8 or later

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.560 
is better than that of 1.8 or later
including<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.910> 1.0<00:00:40.480> update<00:00:41.580> because<00:00:42.580> between

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
including the 1.0 update because between

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.950 
including the 1.0 update because between
1.7<00:00:44.380> point<00:00:44.560> 3<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:44.980> 1.8<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.360> terrain<00:00:46.720> Jenna

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
1.7 point 3 and 1.8 the terrain Jenna

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.600 
1.7 point 3 and 1.8 the terrain Jenna
made<00:00:47.140> change<00:00:47.470> so<00:00:47.590> it<00:00:47.860> could<00:00:47.890> accommodate

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
made change so it could accommodate

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.780 
made change so it could accommodate
ravines<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:49.960> npc<00:00:50.860> villages<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.870> stronghold

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
ravines and npc villages and stronghold

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.550 
ravines and npc villages and stronghold
so<00:00:54.790> what<00:00:55.000> basically<00:00:55.270> taller<00:00:55.810> say<00:00:56.110> is<00:00:56.290> if<00:00:56.470> you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
so what basically taller say is if you

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.060 
so what basically taller say is if you
try<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.920> put<00:00:57.100> in<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.460> seed<00:00:57.790> um<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:59.530> existed

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
try to put in the seed um they existed

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.540 
try to put in the seed um they existed
to<00:01:00.460> be<00:01:00.610> quite<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.880> good<00:01:01.180> seed<00:01:01.450> in<00:01:01.660> like<00:01:02.560> 1.5<00:01:02.829> for

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
to be quite a good seed in like 1.5 for

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.520 
to be quite a good seed in like 1.5 for
example<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.659> try<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:04.900> put<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.170> exact

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
example and you try to put that exact

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.070 
example and you try to put that exact
same<00:01:05.770> seed<00:01:06.040> into<00:01:06.220> 1.0<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:07.090> will<00:01:07.240> not<00:01:07.479> get<00:01:07.900> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
same seed into 1.0 you will not get the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.649 
same seed into 1.0 you will not get the
same<00:01:08.290> world<00:01:08.940> because<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.150> seat<00:01:10.390> will<00:01:10.630> be

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
same world because the seat will be

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.620 
same world because the seat will be
invalid<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.610> i'm<00:01:12.610> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.180> show<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.420> an

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
invalid and i'm going to show you an

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.020 
invalid and i'm going to show you an
example<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:15.130> should<00:01:15.370> have<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.729> wait

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
example that so you should have to wait

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.260 
example that so you should have to wait
for<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.540> second<00:01:17.020> i'm<00:01:17.110> going<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.409> get<00:01:17.560> an<00:01:17.710> example

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
for a second i'm going to get an example

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.760 
for a second i'm going to get an example

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
thought was the best tundra seed in the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.950 
thought was the best tundra seed in the
world<00:02:06.189> because<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.880> just<00:02:07.000> was<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.930> was

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
world because it just was and that was

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.949 
world because it just was and that was
also<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.349> 1.5<00:02:08.859> and<00:02:09.129> many<00:02:09.340> many<00:02:09.489> people<00:02:09.959> in

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
also in 1.5 and many many people in

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.019 
also in 1.5 and many many people in
recent<00:02:11.409> times<00:02:11.590> were<00:02:11.980> women<00:02:12.579> moaning<00:02:12.790> about

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:13.029 
recent times were women moaning about

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:13.590 
recent times were women moaning about
the<00:02:13.269> fact

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the fact

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
that they can't get the world because

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.970 
that they can't get the world because
they're<00:02:15.010> 11.8<00:02:15.730> or<00:02:16.000> higher<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:17.590> kept<00:02:17.830> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
saying that the terrain system keeps

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.010 
saying that the terrain system keeps
changing<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:21.250> does<00:02:21.520> well<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.600> changed<00:02:22.930> a

around me in the 1.5 video let's see we
are<00:03:09.460> spawn<00:03:09.850> now<00:03:10.120> because<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.750> 1.0<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.750> should

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
are spawn now because it's 1.0 it should

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.380 
are spawn now because it's 1.0 it should
be<00:03:14.200> interesting

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.410

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
so as you can see this is absolutely

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.640 
so as you can see this is absolutely
nothing<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.380> lemon<00:03:22.830> seed<00:03:23.370> from<00:03:23.819> before

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
nothing like the lemon seed from before

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.100 
nothing like the lemon seed from before
just<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.740> clarify<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.850> same<00:03:27.090> seed<00:03:27.420> minus<00:03:27.959> 2

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
just to clarify is the same seed minus 2

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.110 
just to clarify is the same seed minus 2
3<00:03:28.350> 3<00:03:28.380> 1<00:03:28.770> 562<00:03:29.400> 3<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.910> 9<00:03:30.150> 20<00:03:30.630> 31<00:03:30.980> 8550<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.370> sound

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
3 3 1 562 3 to 9 20 31 8550 for sound

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.890 
3 3 1 562 3 to 9 20 31 8550 for sound
like<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.300> robot<00:03:33.480> there<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:33.990> what<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> this

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
like a robot there but I what so this

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.290 
like a robot there but I what so this
seat<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.200> nothing<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.070> year<00:03:38.340> 1.5<00:03:39.000> seed

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
seat is nothing like the year 1.5 seed

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.990 
seat is nothing like the year 1.5 seed
even<00:03:39.900> though<00:03:40.020> it's<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> same<00:03:40.500> seed<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.820> that's

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
even though it's the same seed so that's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.090 
even though it's the same seed so that's
what<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.180> trying<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.450> say<00:03:42.510> people<00:03:43.100> domain

find<00:03:55.860> coordinates<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.300> let's<00:03:57.720> think<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.680> some

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
find coordinates so let's think of some

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.610 
find coordinates so let's think of some
random<00:03:59.190> coordinates<00:03:59.640> let's<00:04:00.090> say<00:04:00.570> I'm<00:04:00.989> not

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
random coordinates let's say I'm not

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.420 
random coordinates let's say I'm not
going<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.010> ahead<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.750> type<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.430> down

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
going to go ahead and type this down

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.110 
going to go ahead and type this down
okay<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.480> let's<00:04:07.050> try<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.530> find<00:04:07.769> x<00:04:08.550> equals

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
okay so let's try and find x equals

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.920 
okay so let's try and find x equals
minus<00:04:09.390> 200<00:04:10.170> +<00:04:10.320> Z<00:04:10.800> equals<00:04:11.250> 50<00:04:11.670> so<00:04:12.660> as<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.840> can

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
minus 200 + Z equals 50 so as you can

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.610 
minus 200 + Z equals 50 so as you can
see<00:04:13.110> X<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.590> 44<00:04:14.100> said<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.760> minus<00:04:15.030> 42<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.049> said<00:04:16.350> x

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
see X is 44 said is minus 42 so I said x

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.780 
see X is 44 said is minus 42 so I said x
equals<00:04:17.070> 200<00:04:18.109> right<00:04:19.109> 200<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.040> minus<00:04:20.280> 200<00:04:20.640> I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
equals 200 right 200 and minus 200 I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.840 
equals 200 right 200 and minus 200 I
think<00:04:21.600> was<00:04:21.690> mine<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.079> 1<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.470> X<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.460> Z

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
think was mine is to 1 and X and Z

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.240 
think was mine is to 1 and X and Z
equals<00:04:24.270> 50<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> I'll<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.800> didn't<00:04:26.160> actually

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
equals 50 so I I'll I didn't actually

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.370 
equals 50 so I I'll I didn't actually
type<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.700> down<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.570> find<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.930> coordinates

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
type it down so to find the coordinates

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.719 
type it down so to find the coordinates
we<00:04:28.680> need<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:28.979> do<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.250> need<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.490> have<00:04:29.610> your

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
we need to do you need to have your

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.060 
we need to do you need to have your
debug<00:04:30.180> screen<00:04:30.330> up<00:04:30.600> by<00:04:30.720> pressing<00:04:31.080> f3<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
debug screen up by pressing f3 and you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.490 
debug screen up by pressing f3 and you
need<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.370> try<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.360> follow<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> numbers

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
need to try and follow so the numbers

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300 
need to try and follow so the numbers
end<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:36.290> getting<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> place<00:04:37.830> where<00:04:38.160> you

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
end up getting to the place where you

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.000 
end up getting to the place where you
want<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:39.450> case<00:04:39.630> minus<00:04:39.930> 200<00:04:40.620> is

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
want it to so in this case minus 200 is

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.930 
want it to so in this case minus 200 is
this<00:04:41.310> way<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:43.290> equals<00:04:44.100> 50<00:04:44.550> means<00:04:44.760> going

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
this way and that equals 50 means going

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.750 
this way and that equals 50 means going
in<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.240> diagonal<00:04:45.510> direction<00:04:46.290> this<00:04:46.440> way<00:04:46.760> this

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
in a diagonal direction this way this

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.040 
in a diagonal direction this way this
might<00:04:48.000> involve<00:04:48.270> quite<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.570> bit<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.870> running

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
might involve quite a bit of running

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.490 
might involve quite a bit of running
hello<00:04:49.470> there<00:04:49.680> mr.<00:04:49.950> wolf<00:04:50.810> yes<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.990> love<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.320> too

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
hello there mr. wolf yes I love you too

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.360 
hello there mr. wolf yes I love you too
okay<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.190> let's<00:04:53.490> keep<00:04:53.640> running<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.330> money

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
okay so let's keep running one money

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.110 
okay so let's keep running one money
running<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.960> minus<00:04:57.169> 200<00:04:57.800> Z<00:04:58.160> equals<00:04:58.460> 50<00:04:58.760> let's

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
running so minus 200 Z equals 50 let's

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.080 
running so minus 200 Z equals 50 let's
keep<00:04:59.270> going<00:04:59.479> oh<00:05:00.430> man<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:01.580> going<00:05:01.699> to<00:05:01.760> be<00:05:01.850> so

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
keep going oh man I'm going to be so

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.580 
keep going oh man I'm going to be so
peeved<00:05:02.360> if<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:02.690> ends<00:05:02.870> up<00:05:03.050> with<00:05:03.290> me<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.500> the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
peeved if that ends up with me in the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.780 
peeved if that ends up with me in the
ocean<00:05:03.919> you're<00:05:04.340> no<00:05:04.580> idea<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.650> fear<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.400> may

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
ocean you're no idea but I fear it may

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.170 
ocean you're no idea but I fear it may
so<00:05:08.750> let's<00:05:08.900> keep<00:05:09.020> go<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:10.460> we're<00:05:10.610> almost<00:05:10.790> getting

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
so let's keep go so we're almost getting

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.659 
so let's keep go so we're almost getting
to<00:05:11.330> these<00:05:11.449> edge<00:05:11.690> coordinate<00:05:12.370> what<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.520> mean

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
to these edge coordinate what I mean

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.830 
to these edge coordinate what I mean
it's<00:05:13.820> good<00:05:14.030> okay<00:05:16.210> alright<00:05:17.210> so<00:05:17.389> what<00:05:17.540> does<00:05:17.690> that

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
it's good okay alright so what does that

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.219 
it's good okay alright so what does that
coordinate<00:05:19.030> can<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.090> just<00:05:20.150> point<00:05:20.360> out<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.750> y

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
coordinate can I just point out the y

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.140 
coordinate can I just point out the y
coordinate<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.190> your<00:05:22.400> altitude<00:05:22.790> or

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
coordinate that is your altitude or

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.950 
coordinate that is your altitude or
layer<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.199> I'm<00:05:24.290> at<00:05:24.410> layer<00:05:24.560> 65<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.729> minute<00:05:25.970> ok

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
layer so I'm at layer 65 in a minute ok

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.629 
layer so I'm at layer 65 in a minute ok
so<00:05:27.020> we're<00:05:27.260> almost<00:05:27.410> at<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.800> x-coordinate

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
so we're almost at the x-coordinate

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.689 
so we're almost at the x-coordinate
which<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:28.910> minus<00:05:29.120> 200<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:29.960> certain<00:05:30.740> area<00:05:31.010> so

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
which is minus 200 and certain area so

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.779 
which is minus 200 and certain area so
my<00:05:31.910> memories<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> bit<00:05:32.510> wrong<00:05:33.080> at<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.620> main<00:05:33.830> so

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
my memories a bit wrong at the main so

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.600 
my memories a bit wrong at the main so
don't<00:05:35.090> rage<00:05:35.389> at<00:05:35.539> me<00:05:35.630> for<00:05:35.810> getting<00:05:35.900> along<00:05:36.260> but

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.070 

ok<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:42.669> 50-200<00:05:43.669> so<00:05:44.180> there<00:05:44.360> we<00:05:44.449> go<00:05:44.479> that<00:05:44.780> is<00:05:44.810> how

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
ok so 50-200 so there we go that is how

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.930 
ok so 50-200 so there we go that is how
you<00:05:45.139> find<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.560> coordinate<00:05:45.949> so<00:05:46.130> executed<00:05:46.639> minus

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
you find a coordinate so executed minus

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.960 
you find a coordinate so executed minus
200<00:05:47.389> and<00:05:47.539> dead<00:05:48.169> equals<00:05:48.560> 50<00:05:48.889> so<00:05:49.460> we<00:05:49.669> have<00:05:49.789> to<00:05:49.880> do

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
200 and dead equals 50 so we have to do

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.310 
200 and dead equals 50 so we have to do
keep<00:05:50.180> having<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.419> move<00:05:50.630> about<00:05:50.810> with<00:05:51.199> your

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
keep having to move about with your

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.350 
keep having to move about with your
debug<00:05:51.710> screen<00:05:51.830> up<00:05:52.100> and<00:05:52.310> just<00:05:52.820> follow<00:05:53.120> the

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
debug screen up and just follow the

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.629 
debug screen up and just follow the
numbers<00:05:53.539> until<00:05:54.139> you<00:05:54.289> get<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:55.100> number<00:05:55.550> that

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
numbers until you get to the number that

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.600 
numbers until you get to the number that
you<00:05:55.760> want<00:05:55.789> and<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:57.350> y-coordinate<00:05:58.190> doesn't

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
you want and the y-coordinate doesn't

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.219
