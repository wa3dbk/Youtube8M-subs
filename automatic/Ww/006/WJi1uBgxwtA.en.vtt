couldn't shoot RAW images it wasn't a

which<00:01:59.620> best<00:01:59.860> buy

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:37.860 

something's<00:02:17.250> gone<00:02:17.370> terribly<00:02:17.430> awry

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.350 

that's<00:02:38.870> better<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.069> here<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.030> g11

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
that's better so here we have the g11

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.229 
that's better so here we have the g11
now<00:02:42.080> interestingly<00:02:42.610> cannon<00:02:43.610> reduce<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
now interestingly cannon reduce the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.869 
now interestingly cannon reduce the
number<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.629> megapixels<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.040> model<00:02:46.310> the

number of megapixels on this model the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.750 
while the g11 had a resolution of 10
this<00:02:53.930> bucked<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.379> trend<00:02:54.470> many<00:02:55.370> camera

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
this bucked the trend many camera

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.089 
this bucked the trend many camera
manufacturers<00:02:56.510> were<00:02:56.780> launching<00:02:57.650> cameras

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099

models that can improve the point by

models that can improve the point by

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
saying it wasn't just about megapixels

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.180 
saying it wasn't just about megapixels
