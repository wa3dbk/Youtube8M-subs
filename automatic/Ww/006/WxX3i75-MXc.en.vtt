hormones naturally occurring hormone but

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.200 
hormones naturally occurring hormone but
that's<00:04:53.320> not<00:04:53.440> good<00:04:53.620> for<00:04:53.650> your<00:04:53.800> humans<00:04:54.210> because

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
you're not a baby anymore because the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.050 
you're not a baby anymore because the
soy<00:04:56.740> doesn't<00:04:57.160> have<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.340> growth<00:04:57.490> or<00:04:58.650> negative

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
soy doesn't have the growth or negative

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.400
