playing but some this drum machine is
also<00:00:13.679> does<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.250> exactly<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.730> same<00:00:14.820> thing<00:00:15.179> with

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
also does it exactly the same thing with

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750 
also does it exactly the same thing with
some<00:00:15.480> extra<00:00:15.780> features<00:00:16.220> it's<00:00:17.220> available<00:00:17.460> for

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
show you how to use it so this is the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.420 
show you how to use it so this is the
main<00:00:22.140> interface<00:00:22.410> you've<00:00:22.830> got<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.070> beats<00:00:23.250> per

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
main interface you've got your beats per

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
main interface you've got your beats per
minute<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.760> top<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:24.720> decide<00:00:25.019> what

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
minute at the top so you can decide what

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.070 
minute at the top so you can decide what
tempo<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:26.609> rhythm<00:00:26.930> we've<00:00:27.930> got

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
tempo you one for your rhythm we've got

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.209 
tempo you one for your rhythm we've got
to<00:00:28.170> hear<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.910> 125<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.570> then<00:00:31.050> you've<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to hear it 125 now and then you've got a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.350 
to hear it 125 now and then you've got a
number<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> channels<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.210> make

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
number of channels that will make

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.290 
number of channels that will make
different<00:00:33.870> sounds<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> basic<00:00:35.340> beat<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
different sounds so for a basic beat you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.860 
different sounds so for a basic beat you
might<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:37.820> have<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.629> beat

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
might just have it be on the first beat

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.950 
might just have it be on the first beat
so<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.910> two<00:00:41.910> three<00:00:42.450> four<00:00:42.870> 1234<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.600> as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so it's two three four 1234 and then as

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.810 
so it's two three four 1234 and then as
with<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> metronome<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.309> might<00:00:47.460> want<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> add

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
with a metronome you might want to add

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.959 
with a metronome you might want to add
in<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.180> different<00:00:48.629> sound<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.850> other

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
in a different sound for the the other

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.340 
in a different sound for the the other
beat<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.629> B<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> making<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
beat so the first B is making that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
beat so the first B is making that
current<00:00:53.129> sound<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.030> beads<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
current sound and the other beads make a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.290 
current sound and the other beads make a
different<00:00:54.930> sound<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:57.030> select

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
different sound to do that we select

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
different sound to do that we select
another<00:00:57.420> Channel<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> drop-down

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
another Channel and from the drop-down

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
another Channel and from the drop-down
we<00:00:59.520> select<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.149> different<00:01:00.420> sound<00:01:00.809> I'll<00:01:01.620> put<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
we select a different sound I'll put the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
we select a different sound I'll put the
jungle<00:01:02.340> Beyond<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:03.960> beats<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
jungle Beyond for this the off beats so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
jungle Beyond for this the off beats so
now<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.430> you've<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.110> simple

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
now you can see you've got a simple

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
now you can see you've got a simple
easy-to-follow<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> play

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
easy-to-follow be that you can play

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
easy-to-follow be that you can play
along<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.540> I'll<00:01:13.020> slow<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.710> little

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
along too I'll slow that down a little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.710 
along too I'll slow that down a little
bit<00:01:14.070> fits<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:14.970> slow<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.509> down

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
bit fits so you can slow it right down

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.120 
bit fits so you can slow it right down
so<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.020> you're<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> beginner<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> play<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> much

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so if you're a beginner and play a much

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.320 
so if you're a beginner and play a much
slower<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.270> until<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> speed<00:01:20.330> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
slower be until you get up to speed so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
slower be until you get up to speed so
this<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.509> great<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> metronome<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this is great as a metronome and as I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
this is great as a metronome and as I
said<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> free<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> software<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
said it's a free piece of software you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
said it's a free piece of software you
can<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.110> our<00:01:25.200> website<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
also do advanced things with it and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
also do advanced things with it and
create<00:01:28.680> something<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.490> little<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.790> more

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
create something a little bit more

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
create something a little bit more
entertaining<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.380> added<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> third

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
entertaining so if we added a third

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:41.480 
entertaining so if we added a third
channel<00:01:33.979> let's<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.159> some<00:01:35.310> snare

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.560 

you<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.640> see<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:42.939> got<00:01:43.060> something<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> little

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
you can see we got something a little

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.240 
you can see we got something a little
bit<00:01:43.750> more<00:01:43.869> interesting<00:01:44.140> going<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.770> there<00:01:45.040> a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
bit more interesting going on there a

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.910 
bit more interesting going on there a
fourth<00:01:46.119> channel<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.570> fifth<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.049> six<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.590> you

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
fourth channel a fifth and a six you you

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
fourth channel a fifth and a six you you
know<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.100> combinations<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.729> endless<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.600> what

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
know the combinations of endless of what
