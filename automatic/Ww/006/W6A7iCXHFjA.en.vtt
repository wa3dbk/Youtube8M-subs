this<00:00:17.340> first<00:00:17.640> tip<00:00:17.820> may<00:00:18.029> seem<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.600> tedious

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
this first tip may seem a little tedious

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.420 
this first tip may seem a little tedious
but<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.260> makes<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.529> huge<00:00:19.859> difference<00:00:19.920> when

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
but it makes a huge difference when

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
but it makes a huge difference when
you're<00:00:20.550> organizing<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.119> closet<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
take everything out because I used to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
take everything out because I used to
have<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> walk-in<00:00:23.970> closet<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.170> closets<00:00:25.529> are

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
pretty small so it is easy for things to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.570
