a bodybuilder sponsored by USM so I got

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.770 
a bodybuilder sponsored by USM so I got
into<00:01:11.219> it<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:11.729> him<00:01:11.969> encouraging<00:01:12.600> me

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
into it more from him encouraging me

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.139

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.590 
that way
I<00:01:16.070> think<00:01:17.070> people<00:01:17.640> react<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> bodybuilders<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
I think people react to bodybuilders a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
I think people react to bodybuilders a
lot<00:01:18.810> differently<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.619> Fitness<00:01:20.430> guys

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
lot differently and I think Fitness guys

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.149 
lot differently and I think Fitness guys
is<00:01:20.969> that<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.930> look<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.469> everyday<00:01:22.799> guy

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
is that the look that that everyday guy

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.730 
is that the look that that everyday guy
wants<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.600> opposed<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.079> bodybuilders

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
just to look that hardcore trainers want

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.170
