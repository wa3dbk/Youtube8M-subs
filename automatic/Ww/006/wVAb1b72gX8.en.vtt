size I always fall for the smallest size
of<00:03:26.290> bags<00:03:26.530> because<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.130> seems<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.549> match<00:03:27.970> my

sometimes<00:03:34.359> bigger<00:03:34.600> bags<00:03:34.840> don't<00:03:35.139> look<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:35.410> good

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
sometimes bigger bags don't look as good

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.490 
sometimes bigger bags don't look as good
on<00:03:35.709> me<00:03:35.859> but<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.250> do<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.850> bigger<00:03:37.150> bags<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.750> well
