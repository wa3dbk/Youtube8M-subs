00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:05.078
 Now demonstrate the assembly of a complete set of CO2 aluminum bottles 

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:12.369
 Base groove down assembly base 

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:27.444
 Place the aluminum bottle on the base 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.495
 Lock fine adjustment 

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:40.688
 Fix the adjuster to the aluminum bottle and lock it 

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:44.883
 Open the valve to make the pointer up 

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:49.163
 Loosen the duct nut 

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.465
 Through the duct 

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.981
 Fix the duct to the regulator 

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.485
 Lock nut 

00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:09.455
 Cut the air duct and install the check valve 

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.601
 The direction of the arrow is the direction of the air 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.856
 Connect the duct to the refiner 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.544
 Then connect the upper pipe clamp 

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:37.493
 Make the suction cups in the same direction 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.838
 Open the refiner cover 

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:45.240
 Remove the refinement 

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.190
 Add water to two-thirds 

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:56.790
 Cover with fine film 

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.700
 Locking refiner cover 

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.730
 Put the refiner into the water 

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.490
 Fixed near the bed 

00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.020
 Slowly turn on fine-tuning 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 Adjust carbon dioxide speed 

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:17.670
 The above is the assembly method of the complete set of single-table CO2 aluminum bottles. 

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.860
 Now demonstrate the operation mode of the complete set of single-table CO2 aluminum bottles 

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.290
 Slowly open the regulator 

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:31.510
 Adjust carbon dioxide to the appropriate speed
