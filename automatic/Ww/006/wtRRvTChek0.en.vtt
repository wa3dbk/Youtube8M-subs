00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
experience in water flow what do you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.490 
experience in water flow what do you
currently<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.420> 12<00:02:16.990> year<00:02:17.170> old<00:02:17.260> Hank

I first started with all maxi Jets you
know<00:02:21.190> there<00:02:21.580> were<00:02:21.730> six<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.330> oh<00:02:22.450> man<00:02:22.690> here<00:02:22.960> one

time<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.100> know<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.520> 300-gallon<00:02:25.030> tank<00:02:25.240> and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
time you know on a 300-gallon tank and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.320 
time you know on a 300-gallon tank and
again<00:02:25.780> oh<00:02:26.140> boy<00:02:26.560> plus<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.520> addition<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
again oh boy plus the addition of the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.690 
again oh boy plus the addition of the
closed<00:02:29.020> loop<00:02:29.290> okay<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.460> closed

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
closed loop okay so you do have a closed

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.450 
closed loop okay so you do have a closed
vs<00:02:31.060> dog<00:02:31.300> okay<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:34.230> some<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.440> maxi<00:02:36.250> jet

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
vs dog okay and some of the maxi jet

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.420 
vs dog okay and some of the maxi jet
died<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.240> me<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.870> there's<00:02:38.500> only<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:39.010> left<00:02:39.280> in

died on me so there's only two left in
here<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.090> with<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> addition<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.400> tunze

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
here so with the addition of the tunze

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.010 
here so with the addition of the tunze
okay<00:02:43.120> which<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.430> extra<00:02:45.430> flow<00:02:46.090> for<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.480> bullet

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
okay which is extra flow for the bullet

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.580 
okay which is extra flow for the bullet
tank<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.400> Menard<00:02:48.730> now<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.480> let's<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.470> the

tank so Menard now that let's get to the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.260 
tank so Menard now that let's get to the
nitty-gritty<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.310> why<00:02:51.490> we're<00:02:51.700> here<00:02:52.000> we

about<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.850> it's<00:03:00.850> from<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.360> space<00:03:01.570> man<00:03:02.050> is

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
about it it's from out of space man is

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.650 
about it it's from out of space man is
it's<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:03.070> thing<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:04.210> great

thing is just moves water man I mean you
can<00:03:14.830> see<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.220> flow<00:03:15.610> from<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> top<00:03:16.330> from

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
can see the flow from the top from

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.990 
can see the flow from the top from
underneath<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.680> thing<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.430> go<00:03:18.850> in

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
underneath the thing and just go in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.890 
underneath the thing and just go in
circles<00:03:19.330> like<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:21.430> just

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
circles like this you know it just

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.830 
circles like this you know it just
motion<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.709> could<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.150> could<00:03:25.300> hardly<00:03:25.630> see

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
motion you could you could hardly see

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.730 
motion you could you could hardly see
all<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:27.510> detritus<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.959> bottom<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.560> just

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
all the detritus on the bottom is just

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.280 
all the detritus on the bottom is just
stumbling<00:03:30.100> up<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.580> down<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.330> all<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.959> that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
stumbling up and down so all of that

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.850 
stumbling up and down so all of that
could<00:03:32.920> end<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.730> up<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> overflow<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:35.740> are

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
could end it up in the overflow you are

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.160 
could end it up in the overflow you are
actually<00:03:36.010> getting<00:03:36.370> all<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.880> movement<00:03:37.209> when

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
actually getting all that movement when

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.050 
actually getting all that movement when
your<00:03:38.380> tank<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.800> actually<00:03:39.130> 30<00:03:39.430> inches<00:03:39.760> tall

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
your tank is actually 30 inches tall

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.760 
your tank is actually 30 inches tall
yeah<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.600> if<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.900> look<00:03:41.050> at<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.290> pump<00:03:41.530> you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
yeah and if we look at the pump you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.920 
yeah and if we look at the pump you
actually<00:03:41.950> place<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.760> pump<00:03:43.030> about<00:03:43.209> an<00:03:43.540> inch

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
actually place that pump about an inch

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.620 
actually place that pump about an inch
to<00:03:44.230> two<00:03:44.500> inches<00:03:44.530> below<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.880> water<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
to two inches below the water so the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.570 
to two inches below the water so the
water<00:03:46.750> surface<00:03:47.440> yeah<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.190> you're<00:03:48.400> actually

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
water surface yeah so you're actually

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.420 
water surface yeah so you're actually
moving<00:03:48.940> all<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.360> water<00:03:49.840> uh-huh<00:03:50.440> down<00:03:51.040> 30

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
moving all that water uh-huh down 30

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.090 
moving all that water uh-huh down 30
inches<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.180> then<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:53.230> movement<00:03:53.560> as<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.950> can

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
inches and then this movement as you can

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.670 
inches and then this movement as you can
see<00:03:54.280> it's<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.610> its<00:03:54.790> way<00:03:54.850> back<00:03:55.690> yeah<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.590> on

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
see it's on its way back yeah so it's on

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.050 
see it's on its way back yeah so it's on
its<00:03:56.830> way<00:03:56.860> back<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.840> iterating<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.930> suction<00:03:59.350> out

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
its way back is iterating a suction out

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.530 
its way back is iterating a suction out
here<00:04:01.140> exactly<00:04:02.140> pushing<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> water<00:04:03.540> forward

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
here exactly pushing the water forward

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.320 
here exactly pushing the water forward
and<00:04:04.780> then<00:04:05.350> creates<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:06.010> tunnel<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.550> then<00:04:07.060> goes

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
and then creates a tunnel and then goes

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.570 
and then creates a tunnel and then goes
back<00:04:07.570> in<00:04:07.810> now<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.410> also<00:04:08.680> mention<00:04:09.220> about<00:04:09.400> your

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
back in now you also mention about your

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.280 
back in now you also mention about your
bubble<00:04:09.910> tip<00:04:10.090> an<00:04:10.209> enemy<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:11.050> said<00:04:11.230> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
bubble tip an enemy and you said that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.810 
bubble tip an enemy and you said that
you<00:04:11.410> actually<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:12.010> never<00:04:12.250> seen<00:04:12.520> it<00:04:12.550> move

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
you actually have never seen it move

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.420 
you actually have never seen it move
that<00:04:12.880> much<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.110> bubble<00:04:14.500> tip<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.830> M&amp;A<00:04:15.160> they

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
that much the bubble tip on M&amp;A they

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.370 
that much the bubble tip on M&amp;A they
they<00:04:16.390> move<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:17.970> really<00:04:19.380> moving

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
they move but it's not really moving

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.920 
they move but it's not really moving
that<00:04:20.620> much<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:21.640> i<00:04:21.820> could<00:04:22.120> see<00:04:22.360> now<00:04:22.600> that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
that much like that i could see now that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.620 
that much like that i could see now that
really<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:24.280> know

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
really you know

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.210 
really you know
and<00:04:26.000> she's<00:04:27.000> extending<00:04:27.660> way<00:04:28.200> bigger<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:28.920> than

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
and she's extending way bigger now than

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.120 
and she's extending way bigger now than
it<00:04:29.610> was<00:04:29.670> before<00:04:29.940> my<00:04:30.540> I'll<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> poor<00:04:31.860> right

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
it was before my I'll be a poor right

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.450 
it was before my I'll be a poor right
here<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:33.780> would<00:04:33.930> not<00:04:34.080> see<00:04:34.140> that<00:04:34.620> that

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
here you would not see that that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.840 
here you would not see that that
movement<00:04:35.880> right<00:04:36.510> there<00:04:36.570> because<00:04:37.430> even<00:04:38.430> you're

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
movement right there because even you're

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.210 
movement right there because even you're
gonna<00:04:38.970> see<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.720> tentacles<00:04:40.230> extending

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
gonna see that the tentacles extending

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.170 
gonna see that the tentacles extending
way<00:04:41.760> longer<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:43.080> know<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:43.830> before<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.910> now

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
way longer you know that before but now

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.680 
way longer you know that before but now
you<00:04:45.240> could<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.560> extension<00:04:47.190> on<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.690> tentacles

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
you could the extension on the tentacles

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.530 
you could the extension on the tentacles
it's<00:04:49.500> shorter<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.790> could<00:04:50.970> see<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.300> flow

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
it's shorter but you could see the flow

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.740 
it's shorter but you could see the flow
right<00:04:51.810> there<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.200> just<00:04:53.000> movement<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.510> just

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
right there is just movement it's just

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.320 
right there is just movement it's just
tremendous<00:04:55.500> amount<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.310> force<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.910> were<00:04:57.180> you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
tremendous amount of force and were you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.620 
tremendous amount of force and were you
getting<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.660> movement<00:04:58.440> well<00:04:59.430> snort<00:04:59.940> ids<00:05:00.420> oh

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
getting that movement well snort ids oh

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.310 
getting that movement well snort ids oh
no<00:05:01.050> not<00:05:01.320> at<00:05:01.500> all<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:02.250> also<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.990> SPS<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.170> this

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
no not at all you also have SPS in this

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.430 
no not at all you also have SPS in this
tank<00:05:04.560> lots<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.730> lots<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.120> SBS<00:05:06.450> and<00:05:06.930> I've

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
tank lots of the lots of SBS and I've

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.780 
tank lots of the lots of SBS and I've
noticed<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.890> have<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.070> couple<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.520> very

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
noticed that you have a couple of very

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.850 
noticed that you have a couple of very
very<00:05:09.180> very<00:05:09.360> nice<00:05:09.720> stag<00:05:10.080> worms<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.560> are<00:05:10.620> kind

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
very very nice stag worms that are kind

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.310 
very very nice stag worms that are kind
of<00:05:10.920> bushy<00:05:11.130> lots<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.700> Polish<00:05:12.060> yeah<00:05:12.270> what<00:05:13.230> do<00:05:13.290> you

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
of bushy lots of Polish yeah what do you

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.230 
of bushy lots of Polish yeah what do you
think<00:05:13.530> about<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.920> riptide<00:05:14.580> do<00:05:14.730> you<00:05:14.820> see<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> lot

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
think about the riptide do you see a lot

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.880 
think about the riptide do you see a lot
of<00:05:15.270> polyp<00:05:15.630> extension<00:05:16.140> are<00:05:16.320> you<00:05:16.410> seeing<00:05:16.680> the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
of polyp extension are you seeing the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.790 
of polyp extension are you seeing the
polyps<00:05:17.190> move<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.750> polyps<00:05:19.200> moves<00:05:19.530> around

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
polyps move the the polyps moves around

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.450 
polyps move the the polyps moves around
I<00:05:20.310> mean<00:05:20.940> they're<00:05:21.740> extending<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.830> little<00:05:23.370> bit

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
I mean they're extending a little bit

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.600 
I mean they're extending a little bit
more<00:05:23.700> you<00:05:24.000> know<00:05:24.030> comparing<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.800> pump

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
more you know comparing to the pump

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.240 
more you know comparing to the pump
that's<00:05:26.790> in<00:05:27.150> here<00:05:27.480> now<00:05:27.690> with<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.710> additional

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
that's in here now with the additional

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.470 
that's in here now with the additional
that<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.960> prototype<00:05:31.560> that<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:31.920> were<00:05:32.910> seeing

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
that the prototype that you were seeing

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.500 
that the prototype that you were seeing
here<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:35.370> can<00:05:35.460> see<00:05:35.670> the<00:05:35.700> extension<00:05:36.360> on

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
here and you can see the extension on

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.920 
here and you can see the extension on
the<00:05:36.540> on<00:05:36.900> up<00:05:37.170> on<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:38.100> coral<00:05:38.490> which<00:05:38.670> is

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
the on up on the coral which is

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.410 
the on up on the coral which is
predominantly<00:05:40.520> SPS<00:05:41.520> you<00:05:41.790> can<00:05:41.970> see<00:05:42.150> more

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
predominantly SPS you can see more

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.610 
predominantly SPS you can see more
extension<00:05:43.260> on<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:44.100> palate<00:05:44.460> yeah<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.620> they

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
extension on the palate yeah and they

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.860 
extension on the palate yeah and they
seems<00:05:46.980> they<00:05:47.160> liking<00:05:47.850> it<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.120> know<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.480> the

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
seems they liking it you know the the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.700 
seems they liking it you know the the
you<00:05:49.830> could<00:05:50.010> see<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:51.450> a<00:05:51.750> brittana<00:05:52.350> during

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
you could see the the a brittana during

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.090 
you could see the the a brittana during
their<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.070> tech<00:05:53.340> staghorn<00:05:54.290> that<00:05:55.290> one<00:05:55.560> it's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
their the tech staghorn that one it's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
their the tech staghorn that one it's
just<00:05:56.810> extending<00:05:57.810> way<00:05:58.050> more<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.800> see<00:05:58.980> it

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
just extending way more you can see it

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.250 
just extending way more you can see it
seminar<00:06:00.120> now<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.480> you've<00:06:00.600> had<00:06:00.750> actually<00:06:01.080> had

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
seminar now that you've had actually had

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.530 
seminar now that you've had actually had
about<00:06:01.500> 30<00:06:01.890> minutes<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.340> pretty<00:06:02.970> much<00:06:03.090> look<00:06:03.390> at

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
about 30 minutes to pretty much look at

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.570 
about 30 minutes to pretty much look at
the<00:06:03.630> pump<00:06:03.900> and<00:06:04.260> test<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.860> out<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.010> see<00:06:05.190> how<00:06:05.460> it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
the pump and test it out and see how it

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.190 
the pump and test it out and see how it
works<00:06:05.610> what<00:06:06.000> do<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.150> think<00:06:06.330> about<00:06:06.390> it<00:06:06.660> now

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
works what do you think about it now

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.580 
works what do you think about it now
that<00:06:07.530> I<00:06:07.560> witness<00:06:08.100> it<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:08.670> know<00:06:08.850> I<00:06:09.290> really<00:06:10.290> like

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
that I witness it you know I really like

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.810 
that I witness it you know I really like
it<00:06:10.770> because<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.270> pump<00:06:12.600> is<00:06:13.100> small<00:06:14.100> compact

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
it because the the pump is small compact

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.190 
it because the the pump is small compact
and<00:06:15.120> powerful<00:06:15.990> they<00:06:17.210> are<00:06:18.210> kind<00:06:19.140> of

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
and powerful they are kind of

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.970 
and powerful they are kind of
considering<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:20.340> know<00:06:21.200> changing<00:06:22.200> all<00:06:22.470> these

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
considering you know changing all these

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.130 
considering you know changing all these
bulky<00:06:23.460> bounces<00:06:23.880> in<00:06:24.090> here<00:06:24.330> really<00:06:24.900> you're

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140
