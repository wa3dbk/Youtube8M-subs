00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
is just taking a really dark brown

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.220 
is just taking a really dark brown
eyeshadow<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.730> a<00:03:00.030> tiny<00:03:00.390> tiny<00:03:00.750> eyeshadow

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
eyeshadow and a tiny tiny eyeshadow

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.750 
eyeshadow and a tiny tiny eyeshadow
brush<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.739> just<00:03:01.769> putting<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.640> my

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
brush and I'm just putting that in my

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.580 
brush and I'm just putting that in my
crease<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.269> make<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.540> look<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.900> cut<00:03:04.290> crease

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
crease to make it look like a cut crease

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.500 
crease to make it look like a cut crease
and<00:03:04.890> that's<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.640> because<00:03:05.760> it'll<00:03:06.239> make<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
and that's just because it'll make it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.569 
and that's just because it'll make it
look<00:03:06.720> more<00:03:06.930> factory-made<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.100> since<00:03:08.370> we're

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
look more factory-made and since we're

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.890 
look more factory-made and since we're
being<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.880> doll<00:03:09.090> that's<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:09.570> we're<00:03:09.750> aiming

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
being a doll that's what we're aiming

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.590 
being a doll that's what we're aiming
for<00:03:13.100> then<00:03:14.100> I'm<00:03:14.220> taking<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.700> fluffier<00:03:15.090> brush<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
for then I'm taking a fluffier brush and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.740 
for then I'm taking a fluffier brush and
just<00:03:15.750> blending<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.739> bit

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.180 

now<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:22.930> time<00:03:23.110> for<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.410> eyeliner<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:23.980> the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
now it's time for the eyeliner and the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.820 
now it's time for the eyeliner and the
top<00:03:24.670> line<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.180> am<00:03:25.239> just<00:03:25.599> making<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.170> big<00:03:26.470> long

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
top line I am just making a big long

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:37.190 
top line I am just making a big long
wing<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.610> either<00:03:27.940> side

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.839 

and<00:03:38.200> then<00:03:38.709> for<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.950> bottom<00:03:39.040> line<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.579> did<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
and then for the bottom line I did the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.849 
and then for the bottom line I did the
same<00:03:40.060> exact<00:03:40.480> thing<00:03:40.719> for<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.049> top<00:03:41.230> line<00:03:41.409> I<00:03:41.620> just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
same exact thing for the top line I just

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.920 
same exact thing for the top line I just
made<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.159> wind<00:03:42.489> out<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.390> now<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.780> actually

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
made it wind out so now I'm actually

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.530 
made it wind out so now I'm actually
just<00:03:44.290> taking<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.859> business<00:03:45.340> card<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.090> that's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
just taking a business card and that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.240 
just taking a business card and that's
because<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:47.079> using<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.469> to<00:03:47.620> make<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.890> line

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
because I'm using it to make the line

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.979 
because I'm using it to make the line
really<00:03:48.549> straight<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.239> kind<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:49.659> get<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
really straight and to kind of get the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.959 
really straight and to kind of get the
angle<00:03:50.379> right<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.189> then<00:03:51.310> I'm<00:03:51.400> drawing<00:03:51.640> another

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:51.969 
angle right and then I'm drawing another

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.520 
angle right and then I'm drawing another
line<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.390> connect<00:03:52.689> it<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.959> one<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.470> then

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
line to connect it to that one and then

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.649 
line to connect it to that one and then
I<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.920> filled<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.370> in<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.329> I'm<00:03:55.450> going

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
I just filled it in and then I'm going

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.970 
I just filled it in and then I'm going
to<00:03:55.750> go<00:03:55.959> ahead<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.409> on<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> other<00:03:56.680> side

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
to go ahead and do it on the other side

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.429 
to go ahead and do it on the other side
and<00:03:57.579> then<00:03:57.790> I'm<00:03:57.939> going<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:58.599> continue<00:03:59.260> in
