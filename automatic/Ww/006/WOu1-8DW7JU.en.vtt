 I want to tell you that long ago in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 a distant galaxy was raging 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.890

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.430
 it first 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.759
 what does this remake look like blah company 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.939
 the league was released in 2005 whereas 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.250
 my 2014 set I did much 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.280
 it is better 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.890
 as its 2005 set we see here 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 two minifigures im motorcycle general 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.659
 grivus 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.030
 last year, General Grievous was made 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.890
 yellow shades 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.380
 2014 has finally become white 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.979
 he is armed with four laser swords 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.619
 two green 2 blue pathetic to him so 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.390
 I was given a cry 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.750
 general obi-van kenobi armed 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.420
 characteristic weapon of the creator 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.920
 this set did not give him a call to the sword 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.980
 however he got an energy staff 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.130
 as we remember he took it away from one of 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.250
 General Grievous's bodyguards in the right 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.560
 his hand has a classic blaster with 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.130
 the back of the figure also have 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.070
 print 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.340
 two-sided chapter he has two 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.340
 emotions 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.540
 the central part of this set is 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 General Grievous's motorcycles 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 mattresses are made much better than this 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.190
 2005 cycle 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.410
 and this set is different from most 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.840
 sets so that we are not flying 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.870
 vehicle and vehicle on the ground 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.239
 he bolted motorcycle while driving issues 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:06.250
 sounds similar to the sounds and motorcycle of 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:08.200
 film per cycle can transform 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.650
 when you need to conduct aimed shooting 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.560
 there was a cycle getting on four feet on 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.019
 limbs have claws which does not give 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.900
 feet run up on a motorcycle 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.519
 two guns and one rocket are installed 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.670
 setting and so clear formula cute 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.040
 the mountain and the star wars series on 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.660
