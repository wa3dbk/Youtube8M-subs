00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is it 800 480 this ion engine for i 0

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.289 
is it 800 480 this ion engine for i 0
yeah<00:01:05.519> yes<00:01:06.409> 800<00:01:07.409> x<00:01:07.590> 480<00:01:07.979> pixel<00:01:08.549> yeah<00:01:08.939> yeah<00:01:09.090> and

so<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.630> Wi-Fi<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.169> working<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.919> fact<00:05:38.729> we

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
so the Wi-Fi is working and the fact we

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.650 
so the Wi-Fi is working and the fact we
couldn't<00:05:39.180> connect<00:05:40.250> file<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.550> if<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.449> click
