 hello how are you a roberts and here in the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.839
 today we are going to make a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 a slightly quick review of a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.789
 service that several players have not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.000
 reviewed a lot have not been given a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.619
 importance that is the bar the swing the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.860
 Tuesday screen is this function that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.980
 appears here below to the right 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.260
 on your stick screen that you 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.760
 shows in summary accounts is a 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 minimap of what is it 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.980
 happening on your screen 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 in this case for example I do not have two 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.020
 monitors but for those who have it in 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.910
 this case or a tablet 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 You can select several screen as 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.330
 you can find out here that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.170
 I have the game running well in this 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.730
 I'm on a server 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 exactly I'm partly the storm in 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.710
 the ras mode and let's see by 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.540
 example let's suppose this is my screen 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.610
 secondary is not my primary battle anymore 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.610
 I'm going to click on several chip 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.700
 will load me inside this screen 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.470
 will load me at minimum for and I will 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.350
 I can approach this minimap as is 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.119
 as if I was in the game well for 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.940
 It can give me a pretty insight 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.600
 plus 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.690
 colorful of the map and that if I were 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.000
 for example in the game on this side in 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.700
 the bottom left of the sea or 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.270
 is to see where the screen well set 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.560
 for those who have a tablet or a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.900
 second screen and do not know in what 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.540
 occupying there has a function so that 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.520
 can you give some guys to the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.520
