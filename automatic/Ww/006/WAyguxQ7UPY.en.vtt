story time in the woods but with a bit
of<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.860> difference<00:02:03.190> we<00:02:03.310> break<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.880> bit

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
of a difference we break it up a bit

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.570 
of a difference we break it up a bit
with<00:02:04.420> some<00:02:04.479> drumming<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.410> well<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:06.009> gives<00:02:06.310> us<00:02:06.490> a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
with some drumming as well it gives us a

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.699 
with some drumming as well it gives us a
chance<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.509> fun<00:02:07.690> way<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.320> know<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
chance to in a fun way you know the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.469 
chance to in a fun way you know the
importance<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.429> woodlands<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.300> the

importance of the woodlands and the
forest

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.490 

people<00:02:15.330> ask<00:02:15.480> us<00:02:15.660> what's<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.080> got<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.470> with

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
people ask us what's this got to do with

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.530 
people ask us what's this got to do with
Formula<00:02:17.040> One<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.820> good<00:02:17.970> question<00:02:18.150> but

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
Formula One and it's a good question but

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
Formula One and it's a good question but
there's<00:02:18.930> very<00:02:19.200> good<00:02:19.260> reason<00:02:19.710> Formula<00:02:20.070> One<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
there's very good reason Formula One is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.040 
there's very good reason Formula One is
always<00:02:21.120> right<00:02:21.300> at<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.480> forefront<00:02:21.690> of

always right at the forefront of

always right at the forefront of
Technology<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:23.100> very<00:02:23.190> much<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.460> testbed<00:02:23.880> the

way that formula one's going in the next
few<00:02:25.590> years<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.100> about<00:02:26.280> efficiency<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
few years it's all about efficiency and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.970 
few years it's all about efficiency and
sustainability<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.200> best<00:02:28.380> thing<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.620> what

today they're becoming part of something
I'm<00:02:35.130> turning<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:35.700> something<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I'm turning it into something that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
I'm turning it into something that
endures<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.750> lasts<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.530> idea<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.100> we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
endures and lasts the idea is that we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.340 
endures and lasts the idea is that we

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.869 
in this environment
the<00:03:02.349> time<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:03.129> brilliant<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.610> them<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
the time it's brilliant of them to

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.369 
the time it's brilliant of them to
provide<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.390> opportunity<00:03:04.540> for<00:03:05.170> children

provide this opportunity for children

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.759 
provide this opportunity for children
I've<00:03:06.189> learnt<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.819> far<00:03:06.849> how<00:03:07.540> woodpeckers<00:03:08.530> like

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
I've learnt so far how woodpeckers like

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.059 
I've learnt so far how woodpeckers like
the<00:03:08.980> trees<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.609> be<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:11.140> if<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.590> tree<00:03:11.859> falls

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
the trees to be and that if a tree falls

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.670 
the trees to be and that if a tree falls
down<00:03:12.489> it's<00:03:12.879> good<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.810> song<00:03:14.049> comes<00:03:14.439> in

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
down it's good because the song comes in

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.770 
down it's good because the song comes in
and<00:03:14.829> grows<00:03:15.010> new<00:03:15.250> flowers<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.180> 10<00:03:16.659> to
