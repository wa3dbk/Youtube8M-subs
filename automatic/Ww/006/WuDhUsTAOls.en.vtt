00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hello from the air stopgame.ru 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.340
 microphone Ivan Loyev 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 Today we will talk about one of the most 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.250
 interesting andy projects last 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 of time 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.160
 gods will be watch in maybe someone 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.050
 of you this name seems familiar 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 our present guest is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.300
 capital development of the same name 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.969
 the winners of the competition lyudom dr 26 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 good time so page who knew how 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.250
 so it was in it and it was in her that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.649
 using extremely simple form 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.219
 the game managed to escalate 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.200
 louder than some major works 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.390
 The situation was played out so there is a group 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.670
 from several people and 1 android 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.789
 caught up on an uninhabited planet and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.530
 there is a broken radio and the player had to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.410
 driving here this group of several 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 human android for forty days 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 fix the radio well and actually survive a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 make it very difficult to follow 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 for cold and hunger still all right 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 made a fire there periodically 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670
 hunted down normally but on group members 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.770
 also gives hopelessness of what they can 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.220
 despair and for example jump into 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 the woods 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.320
 the same on this planet lives virus 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 jellyfish due to which the full develops 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.439
 body paralysis and amount of medication 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.240
 limited and radio repair at the end 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.150
 all, too, the process is long and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.549
 dreary as a result everyone started 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 play with the mood in the spirit and where now 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'll show you all how to survive and to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.890
 the twentieth day found themselves in a situation 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 when the only choice was to kill 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.990
 someone from the group because 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.390
 otherwise everyone will just die of hunger 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 but make a heroic face and say that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.509
 we are better 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.840
 die than we cannibalism 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.990
 can not be because it depends 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 millions of human lives and 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 additional complexity lies in 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.470
 that each member of the group 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.099
 partly they are of course necessary friend 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.959
 friends can replace but only partially 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.810
 if the doctor dies or runs away, there is nobody 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.150
 will make an antidote for paralysis if 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.310
 something will happen to a psychologist then you will have to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 spend much more energy to calm 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.950
 teams without an engineer will have much 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.080
 messing with the radio longer there is a loss 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.989
 each of course is not instant 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.970
 fatal however can noticeably spoil 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.880
 in-game life and lead to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 irreparable consequences and by the way at that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.930
 what I just talked about completely 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.730
 you can play for free even in your 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.959
 the browser 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 Enough to drive in google something like 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.299
 gods will be love dr 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 a kind of haze it is the way even 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.070
 Russian language translated full-size 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.890
 the gods version will be very present from 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.810
 yourself a chain of 6 like extreme 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.790
 situations involving slightly 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.489
 recycled cold survival 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.500
 the planet walks on sand dunes 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.660
 raid on science base for abduction 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.590
 hostage information 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.010
 torture or something else not to spoil all 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.799
 I will and each of these situations for sure 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.380
 also multifaceted tense and cruel 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.870
 like the above example i have all of them 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.030
 pass somewhere on the verge and paradox 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.400
 the perception of the game is that with 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.620
 one side seems to be in front of you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.109
 just a quest and you just have to choose 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.299
 the correct course of action and on the other 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.269
 parties this is a quest in which for your 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.230
 mistakes have to be paid by human 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.560
 lives 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.110
 and pay very cruel and brutal and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.879
 the most pleasant thing is that the game has no division 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.670
 to bad good right and 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.310
 wrong player always has a goal and 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.799
 this goal he must achieve regardless of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.410
 what he will have to do and 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.019
 as a result there are only specific 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.930
 their actions are no less specific and 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.209
 consequences do not condemn not cheer 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.450
 no abstract scales or glasses 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.299
 no you will be gods will only 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.549
 look at the original difficulty on 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.540
 passing each scene can get away from 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:19.169
 40 minutes to two or three hours but from the first 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.299
 times you will not pass 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.940
 same in all scenes a certain role 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.100
 plays a banal luck somewhere big 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.139
 somewhere less for example from the first 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.070
 times guess the build sequence 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.560
 antidote 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.660
 somehow happened to me although I suspect 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.690
 that it would be possible to suffer with it much 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.970
 longer there is still the difficulty easy so 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.400
 say for those who love it easier there 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.280
 you will get much less but everything 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.810
 Equally you will transition from one chapter to 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.300
 the other are quite 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.950
 sane cut-scenes if possible so 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.110
 express in relation to pixel y 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.810
 Arta where all the characters speak not by voices but 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.630
 letters on the screen but everything is animated 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.150
 excellent and spelled out no worse because of what 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.550
 observe the development of the plot is interesting 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.840
 and from some point it becomes 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.210
 doubly interesting 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.060
 but again I will not spoil anything 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.460
 after passing each scene in the best 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.099
 traditions of the latest games from tail us 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.160
 show the statistics of how we behaved and 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.169
 how did the other players behave in general 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.370
 nothing special but study happens 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.560
 interesting 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.139
 from what else I would like to highlight 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.690
 This is definitely pixel art quality. 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.729
 and music that helps support and 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.990
 without that tense atmosphere on 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.750
 required level 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.840
 in conclusion, I want to say that's what I'm here 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.810
 recently noticed that the year 2014 has passed 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.580
 already for her middle she is andy front 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.070
 somehow surprisingly calm on and even 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.210
 notable contenders for the indie game of the year 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:51.449
 There is no, and here is finally the first challenger 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.310
 on this title appeared because if 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.440
 can gods will be watching something 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.289
 carp then this is exclusively to 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.050
 something tastes like mu if you're not 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.330
 love pixels can be afraid of blood 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.539
 or something like that in the rest 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.380
 This is a unique gaming experience that I would 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.900
 recommended to test everyone now 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.889
 I remember everything that the gods see everything before 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.889
 Keep quiet and see you at the game ru.
