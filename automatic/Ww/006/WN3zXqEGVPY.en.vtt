00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
those are my choices question number

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.429 
those are my choices question number
four<00:02:53.519> where<00:02:54.120> are<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.419> going<00:02:54.449> to<00:02:54.780> read<00:02:55.019> this

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
four where are you going to read this

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.500 
four where are you going to read this
spring<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:57.620> will<00:02:58.939> probably<00:02:59.939> continue<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
spring and I will probably continue to

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.890 
spring and I will probably continue to
read<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.049> inside<00:03:01.859> like<00:03:02.400> normal<00:03:02.849> because<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
read it inside like normal because you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.929 
read it inside like normal because you
know<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.409> rain<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.799> stuff<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.760> mind

know the rain and stuff I don't mind
reading<00:03:06.359> outside<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:07.109> kind<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.949> but<00:03:08.819> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
reading outside I kind of like it but I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.080 
reading outside I kind of like it but I
don't<00:03:10.099> you<00:03:11.099> know<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.400> kind<00:03:11.669> of<00:03:11.760> depends

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
don't you know it just kind of depends

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.369 
don't you know it just kind of depends
like<00:03:12.449> if<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:14.430> um<00:03:14.669> we<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.419> some<00:03:15.870> like

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
like if it's like um we have some like

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.229 
like if it's like um we have some like
outdoor<00:03:16.859> furniture<00:03:17.219> whatever<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.879> sometimes

outdoor furniture whatever so sometimes

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.479 
outdoor furniture whatever so sometimes
I'll<00:03:18.449> go<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:18.989> set<00:03:19.620> outlook<00:03:19.979> on<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.129> chair

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
I'll go and set outlook on a chair

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.490 
I'll go and set outlook on a chair
outside<00:03:20.699> and<00:03:21.389> that's<00:03:21.540> Kenai<00:03:21.900> sand<00:03:22.169> like<00:03:22.259> Piper

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
outside and that's Kenai sand like Piper

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.589 
outside and that's Kenai sand like Piper
will<00:03:22.799> run<00:03:23.009> around<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.340> play<00:03:23.419> but<00:03:24.419> I<00:03:24.449> don't

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
will run around and play but I don't

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.420 
will run around and play but I don't
like<00:03:24.870> bugs<00:03:25.169> obviously<00:03:25.979> I'm<00:03:26.069> not<00:03:26.099> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.370> go

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
like bugs obviously I'm not going to go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.920 
like bugs obviously I'm not going to go
out<00:03:26.489> if<00:03:26.639> it's<00:03:26.790> raining<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:27.329> stuff<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.870> that

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
out if it's raining out stuff like that

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.050 
out if it's raining out stuff like that
so<00:03:28.319> honestly<00:03:28.979> I'll<00:03:29.129> probably<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.639> boring

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
so honestly I'll probably just be boring

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.300 
so honestly I'll probably just be boring
and<00:03:30.239> continue<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.199> read<00:03:31.349> inside<00:03:31.799> where<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
by Rick Yancey and it's really hard to

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.240 
by Rick Yancey and it's really hard to
tell<00:03:52.949> but<00:03:53.879> um<00:03:54.359> there's<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.829> Sun<00:03:56.069> I'm

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
tell but um there's that the Sun I'm

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.129 
tell but um there's that the Sun I'm
assuming<00:03:56.759> it's<00:03:56.909> brighter<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.569> there's

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
assuming it's brighter and there's

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.020 
assuming it's brighter and there's
actually<00:03:58.560> some<00:03:58.769> streaks<00:03:59.219> kind<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.669> going<00:03:59.909> off

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
actually some streaks kind of going off

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.360 
actually some streaks kind of going off
of<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.509> the<00:04:00.689> Sun<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.199> that's<00:04:01.859> my<00:04:02.159> choice

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
of it like the Sun so that's my choice

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.640

it's<00:04:02.819> not<00:04:03.120> too<00:04:03.419> shabby<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.259> next<00:04:04.500> question

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
it's not too shabby so the next question

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.599
