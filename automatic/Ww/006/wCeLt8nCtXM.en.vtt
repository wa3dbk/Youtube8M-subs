back-to-back<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.690> tough<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.380> any<00:02:28.560> point<00:02:28.800> and

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
back-to-back is tough at any point and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.890 
back-to-back is tough at any point and
to<00:02:29.280> defend<00:02:29.640> back-to-back<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.600> he's<00:02:30.750> got

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to defend back-to-back I think he's got

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600 
to defend back-to-back I think he's got
to<00:02:30.960> be<00:02:31.140> even<00:02:31.320> tougher<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> top

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
to be even tougher you have all the top

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.310 
to be even tougher you have all the top
guys<00:02:32.820> at<00:02:33.060> every<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.600> those<00:02:33.660> both<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.230> those

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
guys at every one of those both of those

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560 
guys at every one of those both of those
events<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.920> all<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.370> takes<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.820> bad<00:02:35.850> day<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
events so all it takes is one bad day to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.230 
events so all it takes is one bad day to
not<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.650> able<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
not not be able to do that so I think we

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.180 
not not be able to do that so I think we
really<00:02:39.480> tough<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.200> from<00:02:40.800> after

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
really tough to do that but from after

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.350 
really tough to do that but from after
seeing<00:02:41.400> his<00:02:41.490> level<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.910> Australian<00:02:42.270> Open

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
seeing his level at the Australian Open

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.450 
seeing his level at the Australian Open
there's<00:02:42.660> no<00:02:42.780> reason<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.200> he's<00:02:44.190> not<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
there's no reason to think he's not the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.310 
there's no reason to think he's not the
favorite<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.910> both<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.210> them<00:02:45.270> guy<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.960> stands
