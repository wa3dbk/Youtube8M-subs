to the bottom or anything so I'm gonna

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.259 
to the bottom or anything so I'm gonna
keep<00:03:21.420> doing<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.319> I'll<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.560> back

okay I'm about 20 minutes in and I turn

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.430 
okay I'm about 20 minutes in and I turn
to<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.209> he<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.810> more<00:03:28.019> towards

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
to think he a little bit more towards

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.430 
to think he a little bit more towards
medium<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.720> because<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.080> was<00:03:31.170> looking<00:03:31.380> kind

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
medium just because it was looking kind

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.259 
medium just because it was looking kind
of<00:03:31.680> thin<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> turned<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> upon<00:03:32.610> about<00:03:32.819> 5<00:03:33.030> minutes

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
of thin I turned it upon about 5 minutes

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.630 
of thin I turned it upon about 5 minutes
ago<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.370> get<00:03:35.370> just

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
ago just to kind of like get just

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.860 
ago just to kind of like get just
thicken<00:03:35.910> up<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.060> bit<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.540> kind<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> like

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
thicken up a bit so it's kind of like

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.360 
thicken up a bit so it's kind of like
watery<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.560> it's<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:37.980> starting<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
watery and it's really starting to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.750 
watery and it's really starting to
thicken<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.760> quite<00:03:39.390> nicely<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:40.280> think<00:03:41.280> after

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
thicken up quite nicely I think after

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.750 
thicken up quite nicely I think after
another<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.660> good<00:03:42.890> it's<00:03:43.890> nice<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.549> I

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
another that's good it's nice to go I

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.180 
another that's good it's nice to go I
might<00:03:44.880> little<00:03:45.540> bit<00:03:45.660> longer<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.620> cuz<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.980> want

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
might little bit longer just cuz I want

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.170 
might little bit longer just cuz I want
it<00:03:47.250> nice<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.750> nice<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.810> thick<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.880> yeah<00:03:51.060> at

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
it nice and nice and thick but yeah at

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.370 
it nice and nice and thick but yeah at
this<00:03:51.299> point<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.750> probably<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.290> to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
this point I'm probably just going to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.640 
this point I'm probably just going to
babysit<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.900> just<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.079> doesn't<00:03:55.109> boil<00:03:55.440> over

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
babysit it just so it doesn't boil over

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.080 
babysit it just so it doesn't boil over
and<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.100> doesn't<00:03:56.280> start<00:03:56.579> sticking<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and so doesn't start sticking to the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880 
and so doesn't start sticking to the
bottom<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.600> somewhere<00:03:58.410> something<00:03:58.620> that

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
bottom but somewhere something that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.140 
bottom but somewhere something that
smells<00:03:59.310> really<00:04:00.530> good<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.590> excited<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.970> yeah

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
smells really good so excited so yeah

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.750 
smells really good so excited so yeah
when<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:03.390> keeps<00:04:03.480> stirring<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.590> then<00:04:04.799> I'll

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
when it keeps stirring it and then I'll

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.460 
when it keeps stirring it and then I'll
check<00:04:05.970> back<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.480> guys<00:04:06.720> let's<00:04:07.049> culture

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
check back with you guys let's culture

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.670 
check back with you guys let's culture
to<00:04:07.560> being<00:04:07.739> finished<00:04:08.720> okay<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.870> am<00:04:10.019> back<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.500> my

to being finished okay I am back with my
taste<00:04:10.950> test<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:12.660> probably<00:04:13.079> won't<00:04:13.230> for

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
taste test this probably won't for

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.410 
taste test this probably won't for
exactly<00:04:13.950> about<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> half<00:04:14.609> an<00:04:14.790> hour<00:04:14.880> what<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.239> did

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
exactly about a half an hour what I did

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.870 
exactly about a half an hour what I did
was<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.600> had<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:15.930> medium<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.500> low<00:04:16.880> probably

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
was I had about medium to low probably

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.960 
was I had about medium to low probably
for<00:04:18.299> about<00:04:18.530> 15<00:04:19.530> minutes<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.130> then<00:04:20.519> maybe

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
for about 15 minutes and then maybe

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.730 
for about 15 minutes and then maybe
about<00:04:21.150> 10<00:04:21.479> minutes<00:04:21.660> there<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:21.959> had<00:04:22.229> more

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
about 10 minutes there I had more

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.140 
about 10 minutes there I had more
towards<00:04:23.100> medium<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.640> kind<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:23.880> get<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.120> to

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
towards medium you kind of get it to

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.390 
towards medium you kind of get it to
thicken<00:04:24.450> up<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:24.810> bit<00:04:24.930> more<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:26.220> then

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
thicken up a little bit more and then

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.740 
thicken up a little bit more and then
once<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.669> picking<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.270> really<00:04:27.450> started

once I picking up and it really started

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.000 
once I picking up and it really started
above<00:04:27.960> all<00:04:28.110> even<00:04:28.350> though<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.500> was<00:04:28.590> extremely

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
above all even though it was extremely

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.869 
above all even though it was extremely
constant

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
constant

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.419 
constant
put<00:04:29.999> it<00:04:30.089> back<00:04:30.240> down<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.749> kind<00:04:30.899> of<00:04:31.129> meet<00:04:32.129> him<00:04:32.279> to

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:32.429 
put it back down to kind of meet him to

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:34.209 
put it back down to kind of meet him to
low<00:04:32.580> heat<00:04:32.819> and<00:04:32.999> it<00:04:33.240> went<00:04:33.479> for<00:04:33.719> about<00:04:33.749> exactly

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:34.219 
low heat and it went for about exactly

low heat and it went for about exactly
30<00:04:35.219> minutes<00:04:35.309> and<00:04:36.229> this<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.349> what<00:04:37.439> I<00:04:37.499> haven't
