 cinnamon to make these cookies 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.189

 sugar icing a spoonful of butter

 in ointment or lard for 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.189
 attach the bowl where we are going to do 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.470
 our workshop two eggs one whole and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.720
 the clear of eight two teaspoons type 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.270
 medium ground cinnamon dessert 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.100
 teaspoon ground ginger dessert 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.240
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.250
 and extra virgin olive oil three 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.830
 tablespoons five grams of yeast 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660
 Chemical or baking powder preparation 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.520
 of the recipe to prepare our 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.830
 recipe the first thing is to have the lights 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840
 peeled without anything of shell we put the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.880
 minds in a grinder with indicator and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.950
 We reduce to a little thick powder to 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.960
 that is more compact the cookie is 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.820
 They are slightly better than grain as 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 You see here when we have them ground 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 we go 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 to add the flour that we are going to process 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 if you can make the flour and the impeller 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.200
 that is to say the best chemical yeast but 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.390
 add even directly we throw the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 rest of our flavorings in this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 case the ginger cinnamon and vanilla 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.619
 we split the egg we separated the yolk from 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.390
 the clear in this case we're going to add the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.880
 egg white and the yolk we leave it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.460
 for another recipe we put in the other 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 whole egg and stir recipe 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.330
 again integrating well all the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 ingredients that we left a dough 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.289
 woman as not everything sticks although the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 just be the egg we're going to 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.250
 need a fat in this case we have 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 employee extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.310
 now let's put our hands once 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.680
 that we have our mass already integrated in 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.750
 we stretch a plastic film and put that 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.789
 mass there we put it directly to the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.399
 freezer or refrigerator and freezer 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.340
 half an hour would be enough past this 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.190
 time we take out the cookie dough and 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.869
 with a knife we cut into pieces more or 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.180
 less than one and a half centimeters or two 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.670
 when we have the pieces cut 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.069
 we add the icing sugar has to be 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 like a kind of sugar movie 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.299
 which causes it to caramelize in a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.650
 oven with our hands we make like 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.630
 balls as if they were meatballs 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
 while we are making these balls 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.519
 we had to preheat the oven 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.849
 for 10 minutes at 200 degrees and 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.849
 we started to give it with sugar 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.629
 girls we have as if they were some 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.459
 truffles we take in the tray 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.650
 we crush a little with your finger and 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.780
 we place cookies with space 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.780
 because they 're going to grow a little bit because of 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.069
 the yeast and put in the oven for 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.110
 13 14 minutes at about 180 to 190 degrees 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.209
 minute up minute down you only have 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.549
 that you see important to leave 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.650
 cool and harden I hope that you 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.970
 like and I'm sure you're going to 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.970
 repeat this recipe more than once
