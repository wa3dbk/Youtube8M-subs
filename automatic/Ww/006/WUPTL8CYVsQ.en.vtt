00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.000
 it's everyone this midnight I hope 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.090
 you and well today we find ourselves 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.920
 on call of duty launched warfare for 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.869
 get out of the map puzzled 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.570
 thanks to cognac first of all it will take 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.610
 obviously bring you a goliath 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.290
 I advise to take the liaison 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.820
 satellite because it's my fashion the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.220
 faster in part private otherwise 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.010
 trying in multiplayer it can be 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.510
 nice to do it with friends full multi 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 essays but still special 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.949
 only once in the goliath 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.559
 when you see you started coming in 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.290
 in finally that you see that your 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.879
 character is almost in it will take 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.489
 joystick weather to the right to go 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.860
 directly into the water once half 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.140
 in the water is half on the ground finally 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.500
 in the void or in the air as you 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.990
 want to put your gc that to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.810
 the right to power forward a maximum 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.710
 this you stay still you will be killed 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 instantly 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.270
 it will be necessary to advance a maximum toward 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.740
 the front good there I do a little bit matter 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.780
 what because I lost a little 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.190
 benchmarks but I advise as the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.500
 satellite link there are full 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.539
 of goals have to try to have all 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.610
 players and all goals towards 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.009
 the top so once will move on to 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.110
 maximum normally you should review 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 clear it's normal that in front of a screen 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.349
 black 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.970
 so me it's this one I hope that 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.190
 that choose will have more in any case me 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.910
 that's more about presenting you this glitch so 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.910
 is everyone
