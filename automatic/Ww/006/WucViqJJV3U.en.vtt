00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.990
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 I have boxing video today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 a night light so pretty simple 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.560
 history and that is one 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.990
 night light from gv and indeed has this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 news was special features it is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.390
 not as much a message as you can 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.699
 somewhere the outlet 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.109
 which blows all night pointless 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.579
 this is a night light with several 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.920
 additional functions to the first one has it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 motion detector to the second one 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.320
 dusk switch and third 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.610
 two light functions a tail light 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 function and in front a kind of small 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.309
 position light the fuller about this 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 night light I stick this night light 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.739
 in a socket provides the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.870
 Dusk switch for that only 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 at night that only works if 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.609
 a certain brightness level 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 falls below then turns off 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.039
 here in front of this small position light 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.600
 on 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.549
 but you can see that this system 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 works and how to have a small one 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.110
 for example, in a corridor after 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.600
 you can walk and you can see 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.159
 at least that much you do not 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 secondly , there is one more here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.930
 motion detector registered in it 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.840
 Motion detector in the radius of the night 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 Light movement switches the night light 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.750
 a little something in the back 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 bigger light with what then leads to it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.970
 that one then in the environment of the night light 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.540
 it lit up a bit better again 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 becomes 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.610
 and you can sleep at night if you like 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 time to toilet or you have to over 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.100
 just walk the hallway over the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
 corridor run without any big 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 turn on lighting and can turn 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.509
 so to speak his way so we pack 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 that just happens to have it out here 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.200
 the packaging 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.490
 it is tightly welded because of that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.219
 I now with a pair of scissors 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.780
 cut it out and it comes to us 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.700
 night light in addition to the documents 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.700
 we have the message here 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 and here the usual documents like the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.730
 like the guarantee the guarantee certificate of 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.460
 gv and a small user manual 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 also from gv son is now just times 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.430
 to look closer at the night light 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.710
 I'll have a quick look into the camera 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.410
 the night light is rather on us and we 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.070
 have up here the front position light 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.040
 every motion detector every dawn 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:44.070
 sensor i'm dealing with here we have 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.100
 Now the main light is the plug and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.560
 here a lever with the switch 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.020
 We can sustain two modes once 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.530
 to that is continuous lighting and once 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.630
 automatic so the sensor and the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.480
 We are looking at motion detectors 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.950
 Just use the device in action 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.300
 so now I have the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.950
 room lighting to a minimum 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.930
 shut down and we are stuck now 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.840
 Just put the nightlight here in the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.540
 I can go to automatic mode and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.510
 then I turn off the light then 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.730
 to look like the night light 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.770
 works after we turn the nightlight on 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.810
 have inserted have come first 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.190
 a small test phase that is this one 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.560
 back lighting is only now 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.060
 a certain amount of time to light up 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 signal that everything is fine here 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.330
 is and when the taillight goes out 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.670
 we can test the night light 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.870
 so the test went through that is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.730
 the night light is now fully in 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.700
 standard operation switch times the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.580
 camera lighting out so seen now 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.910
 this is now the standard front light 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.950
 it shines so the standards state 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.990
 if a certain brightness levels 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.400
 has been fallen short and now 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.490
 we can always do the following 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.590
 just move around in this environment 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.290
 night light and let's see if that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.550
 I realize at all I hope 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 now just here through the room 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.630
 and we see right away that's mine 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.610
 movement registered and give in the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.220
 almost fully lit mode thus 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.560
 then you have enough light in the room around you 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.520
 actually in every room at night 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.680
 orientate 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.880
 the beautiful on the night light it runs 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.130
 on a LED basis 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.250
 has an extremely low power consumption 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.930
 and you have such a nice alternative 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.410
 especially if you have children or 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.030
 something similar and you might want to 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.620
 go to the loo at night alone or on 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.480
 Toilet that you almost do not 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.070
 somehow into the darkness 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.650
 beats and then they stumble somewhere 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.690
 or something else will break one here 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.240
 very cheap alternative for everyone 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.800
 Baumarkt is still around the children 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.420
 a bit of protection and a bit 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 to give security even in the night 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.310
 so that 's it for the small unboxing 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.580
 and a little test about this gv and 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.010
 night light and if you have more about 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.690
 I would like to experience this light below 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.670
 I'll give you a little link in the video 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.830
 description set there you still have 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.470
 some information about this 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.170
 You can buy the product in 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.000
 Most German hardware stores and 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.710
 That's how I come to the end of my life 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.960
 unboxing videos and things hereby 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.560
 shot until next time your mark 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.560
 on youtube
