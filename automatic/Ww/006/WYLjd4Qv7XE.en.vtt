00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.940
 Hello everyone, while we drive the car for recording 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.530
 video answer your questions and question 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 very simple 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.430
 a little funny but still answer 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:23.269
 the question sounds so tell about springs 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 This type of our rustic cattle in such 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:34.020
 the question is what to say about the springs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.030
 no village life it can be said this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.950
 subculture is mostly people 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.950
 who are called springs live in the south 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.730
 in small cities well, that is, in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 principle yes it is the village people although in 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 principle now places where people live 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.830
 which principle can be called the size 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.550
 and not quite the village 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.920
 but but yes this is not a megalopolis 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.680
 In general, the word spring is offensive 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 the word is considered though some people 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 Conversely as the black is more black 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 black ice loops you say it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.729
 don't offend the view at all 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.729
 offensively 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.439
 Niger 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.030
 although they call it themselves 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.110
 barn that is 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.150
 and there are such rednecks who are proud 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 the fact that they are springs they themselves 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 called springs 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.690
 but there are those for whom it is insulting 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.360
 vocabulary to but generally derived from two 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.820
 words in english the red ink 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.590
 red red nike is a neck because 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.159
 the subject is mostly people who 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.009
 work not in the office but on the street on farms 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.250
 either there is no scope for some kind of string 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.880
 Well 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.619
 earlier they probably started back 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360
 call the warriors of those people who 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.700
 worked here in agriculture and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.370
 so they have a red neck from the sun 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:20.470
 tanned and that's what made the word 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:26.860
 spring springs they are patriotic people they 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.590
 patriots of america basically but here's how 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.900
 how can a spring show itself so 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.480
 what is he riding here on a huge brawl on 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 which stickers 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:43.390
 There are more US logs besides stickers and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:50.360
 just big flags also love relatives 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:53.140
 not the us flag hang in a dress coat you also 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.140
 springs love not flag usa hang flag 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140
 confederation 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.040
 the flag which dnr in itself with pioneers 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.750
 came up with themselves that this is their flag 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 In fact, this is the flag of confederation 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.239
 it turns out they hate america but 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.750
 In this same America they are also Slacks. 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.750
 pioneers 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:29.239
 at the springs in their own special such talk 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.239
 accent as it is called correctly 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.780
 dialect 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.709
 yes they do not tell them funny and when do you 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.459
 like 1 that is, in principle there is a lot 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.500
 people who can be called Rodak 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.890
 people like people they are just like that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 but there are such specimens directly in 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.860
 which stereotypes themselves collars just 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.670
 here it is written which here it is 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.030
 stereotypes 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.780
 these are very funny people I kind of met 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.870
 such a guy 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.290
 here he is how he says but it's just 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.920
 Hochma I I restrained to just 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.500
 Keep 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.420
 so this is so funny such a typical 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.420
 Rodnikovskiy he had a conversation 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.570
 but what else to add 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 No, it is not cattle, this is it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.210
 American subculture is people 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:31.470
 who live mostly in the southeast 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.470
 Usa who mostly work outside 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.030
 not that they are uneducated but new 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.890
 I think a small percentage 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.110
 Native as has all the same higher 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.450
 education is such a subculture and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.530
 such about them complexity raqib which 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.240
 walls in principle but like everywhere else you all 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.110
 among the native would hardly be among 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.050
 there are no other relatives among 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.270
 ordinary there is also kind of cultural 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.910
 a person seems to look normal 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.200
 dressed normally from red shine he can 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.570
 be therefore us some 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.150
 so why call springs cattle 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.030
 not good at all different square you 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.980
 calling is not good because it's all 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:25.470
 yet it is considered offensive so 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:28.090
 so there are such people in the village 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.010
 sometimes good sometimes not so and when 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.200
 friendly food but not to be confused 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.360
 springs with others too similar 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760
 subcultures like vodka were cut there 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.820
 still such a subculture 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.970
 there is still white trash white trash sometimes 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.340
 Native to confused with white trash but this this 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.210
 not this 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:56.009
 it's different too 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.720
 I would say that file thrash is still such 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.849
 subculture that separated from 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.680
 warriors are the very people who 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:06.830
 live on benefits who do not want anything 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.830
 do that which eat evil 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.880
 ok enough then about the spring in this 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.800
 video ask more questions 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.100
 interesting my reason whenever possible 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.030
 free to answer them thank you all 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.030
 for watching all bye
