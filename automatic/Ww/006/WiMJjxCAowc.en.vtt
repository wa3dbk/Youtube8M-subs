 lluís I bring an episode of the series 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
 looking for geox the game in which I'm going 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.489
 to teach how to have an infinite action 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.939
 in the war machine and the machine 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.939
 death 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.510
 Well first of all, welcome to me 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.400
 canal if garcía sanz and I bring you a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.560
 episode of the series looking for the 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.120
 game in which I 'm going to teach you not today 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.950
 I do not come to teach anything because it is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.240
 of episode 100 and did not want to bring 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 no trick since it is a very 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.860
 round and I wanted to do something 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 different although I know you will be 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.130
 waiting for some trick but good as 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.630
 you are watching is modern warfare 3 is the 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.730
 first episode that went up the channel 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.920
 tricks and it was about how to get out of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.309
 map of the underground with the SUV 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 this and also to see you will have seen the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.280
 principle that was also brought the last 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 episode that was how to get 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.650
 infinite bullets in the war machine 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 and machine of death and above all you will have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.369
 noticed that the voice has changed me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 quite on the plan that it used to be 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.290
 much drier since it was the first 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 video that I went up to the gameplay channel or 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 tricks then I say that in these 99 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.440
 episodes that have happened will have changed 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.540
 a little the voice and not only that but part 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.750
 also the quality of video and audio and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.910
 that you will have noticed that I had as much 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 distortion my voice and then also the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.980
 because the video quality has improved since 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.860
 now 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.140
 1080 at least what records video 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.870
 before it's 720 with the change of 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 capturing as it has improved and good 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.730
 as you will have seen before looking 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 holes to the game where does it come from 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.680
 this series I already knew that my 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.660
 channel was going to be basically so 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.340
 say it dedicated to the tricks though 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.130
 aside I upload other things because also 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.620
 I like to go up variety but I had to 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.820
 put a different name not only me 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.660
 it was worth with a glitch spot trick not 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.880
 I wanted to give it a name then we 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.740
 we put to think and the trick came from the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 my brother's hand as my name 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.020
 de garcía sanz but this time the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.110
 looking for holes in the game did not appeal to me 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.900
 much the truth of the name but then to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.550
 final in these hard during these 999 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.660
 episodes the truth that is one of the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.350
 names that I like the channel 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.120
 then at the end 99 episodes have 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.150
 it was worth it especially with that name 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.820
 and there are going to be many more I hope to double or 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.970
 triplicate is this number and I wanted 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.980
 bring it because I already have more tricks 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.440
 and do not want to delay me with them as 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.990
 you know that cliches go very fast 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.910
 and they usually leave very soon so nothing 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.260
 I hope you liked this semi 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.660
 special so to speak because it is not 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.520
 special of everything and good do me the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.470
 team shouting if it's like that if you like it 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.960
 this series because you already know a likes 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 thanks and makes me very happy and 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.780
 nothing nothing more to say 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.390
 I suppose tomorrow the 101 floor will go up 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.610
 of looking for color the game already sounds a 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.890
 little weird but good the cover is made 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.600
 bigger and the biggest title nothing 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.180
 more than saying I hope you liked it 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.830
 and see you in the next video that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.100
 will be looking for holes to the game 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.100
 episode number 101 until next time
