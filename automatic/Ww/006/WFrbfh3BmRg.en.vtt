don't ever get three gross oblasts you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.889 
don't ever get three gross oblasts you
can<00:00:47.730> take<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> second<00:00:48.360> woman<00:00:48.480> survival

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
now these little black puddles basically

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
now these little black puddles basically
they<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.810> form<00:01:51.810> wherever<00:01:52.200> you're<00:01:52.380> standing

they're<00:01:55.530> pretty<00:01:55.890> simple<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.030> third<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
they're pretty simple the third thing is

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
they're pretty simple the third thing is
the<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:02:00.170> wave<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.560> clipped<00:02:01.979> across<00:02:02.280> the

the kind of wave that clipped across the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.240 
the kind of wave that clipped across the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
just kind of run into the middle and try

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
just kind of run into the middle and try
not<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.149> hit<00:02:09.330> by<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.489> a
