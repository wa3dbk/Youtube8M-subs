00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.279
 well hello everyone with you eddie today 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.990
 we will see a mod that was made in honor 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.940
 10th Anniversary Cry Gattas Andreas 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.550
 and this mod adds to the game system 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.620
 achievements or system achivok call 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.420
 as you wish it is shorter to 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.910
 see all these achivki click on 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.279
 l key combination 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.239
 l plus 1 is 1 5 people or l + 2 is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.849
 the second 5 achivok either l + 3 is the rest 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:35.010
 Achivki who are in this fashion all of them 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.109
 in my opinion either 17 or 1802 by 18 and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.600
 Here we can arrow up if you become 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.160
 Achivki and watch their status Pragin they 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.289
 or not passed well to plant 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.510
 press the spacebar for example this one 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.359
 before time to kill to that with the last 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.629
 the mission is connected and we look at the file but not 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.789
 passed one from open next 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.030
 let's from the first list for example 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.850
 represent 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.149
 and pastes on first passed green 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 Significantly already passed the file is not passed all 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.670
 These achivki are in the readme file of the readme mod 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.380
 yes so to speak and they are written there 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.860
 Described what should be this 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.320
 do 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.280
 then fashion is one big minus 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.400
 dear friends 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.049
 for example, when we go through one or the other and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.299
 cheveux to teach they have all the laptop 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.850
 I can not understand yes when we go through 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.770
 or any other achievement then we on the screen in any way 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.600
 what is passed is not displayed 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.780
 passed and it is very sad for us 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 warn you just have to go in and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.040
 check passed on rhinitis is of course 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.140
 doing takes longer but all 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.270
 same author made such an interesting mod yes 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.180
 Interestingly idea achievement system but 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.320
 I think the sensor is not enough 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.869
 only 17 pieces to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.600
 but in my opinion all these achivki taken from x box 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 Of the sky version well, at least for that too 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.799
 thank you very interesting at least some 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.039
 target appears for example after 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.020
 passing gta san andreas so here 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.420
 such a mod on the achievement system 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 thought up remembered keys this combination 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.149
 l1 or l2 and plus l3 and yes there is for example y 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.460
 you will already save 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.680
 passed one hundred percent for sure 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.720
 probably already have all achivki will bend 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.800
 on you and will be already uninteresting so 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.290
 better start but 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.080
 a game or some kind of saved in which 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.910
 these errors have not yet passed and but solve 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.830
 you dear friends, well, the essence is there too 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.520
 such a mod for gta sa analysis which 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.460
 It came out very recently it's like 10 9-story 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.830
