you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.119 

my<00:00:50.559> father's<00:00:50.949> illness<00:00:51.250> started<00:00:52.059> probably

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
my father's illness started probably

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.310 
my father's illness started probably
three<00:00:54.129> years<00:00:54.370> prior<00:00:54.789> to<00:00:55.210> when<00:00:55.839> he<00:00:55.960> took<00:00:56.140> his

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
three years prior to when he took his

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.950 
three years prior to when he took his
life<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.949> think<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.850> my<00:00:58.089> father<00:00:58.359> struggled

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
life I think that my father struggled

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.399 
life I think that my father struggled
with<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.109> lot<00:00:59.229> of<00:00:59.409> issues<00:00:59.739> that<00:01:00.839> had<00:01:01.839> come<00:01:02.199> from

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
with a lot of issues that had come from

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.070 
with a lot of issues that had come from
his<00:01:02.589> childhood<00:01:03.479> losing<00:01:04.479> his<00:01:04.600> mother<00:01:04.839> at<00:01:05.049> birth

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
his childhood losing his mother at birth

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.859 
his childhood losing his mother at birth
and<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:05.890> basically<00:01:06.759> being<00:01:07.210> raised<00:01:07.509> by<00:01:07.659> his

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
and then basically being raised by his

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.270 
and then basically being raised by his
grandparents<00:01:08.970> throughout<00:01:09.970> his<00:01:10.149> life<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.780> think

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
grandparents throughout his life I think

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.620 
grandparents throughout his life I think
he<00:01:12.280> probably<00:01:12.490> always<00:01:12.850> struggled<00:01:13.479> with<00:01:13.600> that

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
he probably always struggled with that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.440 
he probably always struggled with that
but<00:01:14.439> really<00:01:14.619> didn't<00:01:15.039> know<00:01:15.189> he<00:01:15.789> had<00:01:15.819> something

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
but really didn't know he had something

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.240 
but really didn't know he had something
that<00:01:16.479> changed<00:01:17.080> in<00:01:17.259> his<00:01:17.380> job<00:01:17.740> we<00:01:18.069> got

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
that changed in his job we got

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.609 
that changed in his job we got

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
basically exposing a lot more about our

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.430 
basically exposing a lot more about our
story<00:03:38.950> our<00:03:39.280> our<00:03:39.850> life<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:41.020> was<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> difficult

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
story our our life it was a difficult

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.470 
story our our life it was a difficult
thing<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.950> go<00:03:42.190> through<00:03:42.220> but<00:03:42.550> at<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> same<00:03:43.209> time

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
thing to go through but at the same time

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.570 
thing to go through but at the same time
I<00:03:43.840> think<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.709> people<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.100> Victoria

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
I think that the people of Victoria

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.060 
I think that the people of Victoria
really<00:03:45.820> got<00:03:46.000> behind<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.290> results

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
really got behind it and the results

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.420 
really got behind it and the results
were<00:03:48.880> much<00:03:49.090> higher<00:03:49.330> than<00:03:49.600> what<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:49.900> expected

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
were much higher than what we expected

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.890 
were much higher than what we expected
but<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.520> know<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.790> event<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.330> we<00:03:52.660> had<00:03:52.810> in

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
but you know the event that we had in

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.949 
but you know the event that we had in
the<00:03:52.990> charitable<00:03:53.290> cause<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.800> we<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.730> we<00:03:54.959> put

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the charitable cause that we that we put

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.110 
the charitable cause that we that we put
together<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.860> was<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.040> real<00:03:57.250> healing<00:03:57.550> process

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
together that was a real healing process

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.580 
together that was a real healing process
I<00:03:58.209> think<00:03:58.360> for<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:58.570> of<00:03:58.600> us<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.990> mean<00:03:59.140> as<00:03:59.230> much<00:03:59.380> as

I think for all of us I mean as much as

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.660 
I think for all of us I mean as much as
it<00:03:59.709> was<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.860> something<00:04:00.850> that<00:04:02.130> was<00:04:03.130> new<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.550> the
