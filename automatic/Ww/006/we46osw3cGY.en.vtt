00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.260 
which is basically an Italian eggplant -
we've<00:00:14.559> got<00:00:14.740> some<00:00:15.040> sautéed<00:00:15.670> eggplant

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
we've got some sautéed eggplant

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.409 
we've got some sautéed eggplant
that<00:00:16.990> I<00:00:17.020> lightly<00:00:17.619> seasoned<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.460> drained<00:00:18.820> in<00:00:19.210> a

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
that I lightly seasoned and drained in a

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.060 
that I lightly seasoned and drained in a
colander<00:00:19.779> it<00:00:20.200> helped<00:00:20.529> take<00:00:20.739> away<00:00:20.950> the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
colander it helped take away the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.139 
colander it helped take away the
bitterness<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.820> it'll<00:00:22.000> actually

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
bitterness and it'll actually

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.630 
bitterness and it'll actually
concentrate<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.050> cells<00:00:23.349> of<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.680> eggplant<00:00:24.099> so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
concentrate the cells of the eggplant so

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.920 
concentrate the cells of the eggplant so
when<00:00:24.790> you<00:00:24.910> fry<00:00:25.180> them<00:00:25.360> in<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.540> oil

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
when you fry them in the oil

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.409 
when you fry them in the oil
they<00:00:26.320> won't<00:00:26.500> absorb<00:00:26.739> so<00:00:27.189> much<00:00:27.369> fat<00:00:27.730> so<00:00:28.300> these

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
they won't absorb so much fat so these

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.970 
they won't absorb so much fat so these
are<00:00:28.599> nice<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.960> golden<00:00:29.290> brown<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.529> they're
