Wow<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.600> got<00:02:13.840> me<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> thinking<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:15.700> you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
Wow so this got me to thinking if you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.330 
Wow so this got me to thinking if you
can<00:02:16.090> find<00:02:16.300> any<00:02:16.600> opt<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.470> got<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> be<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> run

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
can find any opt if it's got to be a run

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.840 
can find any opt if it's got to be a run
between<00:02:18.580> those<00:02:18.970> two<00:02:19.660> notes<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:21.490> some

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
between those two notes that is some

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.140 
between those two notes that is some
kind<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.500> run<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.860> know<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.460> might<00:02:25.030> be

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
kind of a run you know right might be

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.970 
kind of a run you know right might be
limited<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.960> would<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.290> your<00:02:26.470> be<00:02:26.650> playing

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
limited and I would that your be playing

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.800 
limited and I would that your be playing
in<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.280> key<00:02:27.760> that's<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.240> great<00:02:28.450> way<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.630> think

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
in that key that's a great way to think

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.250 
in that key that's a great way to think
about<00:02:28.960> yeah<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.460> use<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.880> note<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.020> your

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
about yeah if you use that note is your

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.910 
about yeah if you use that note is your

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
home center and work out for the see

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.980 
home center and work out for the see
what<00:02:36.130> works<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.880> what<00:02:37.060> don't<00:02:37.330> work<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.810> this

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
what works and what don't work and this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.990 
what works and what don't work and this
use<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.380> ones<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.740> work<00:02:38.950> you're<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.820> that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
use the ones that work you're in that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.490 
use the ones that work you're in that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
key so that opens it all up to me about

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.570 
key so that opens it all up to me about
positions<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.370> remember<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:48.100> time<00:02:48.370> to

positions and I remember from time to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.930 
positions and I remember from time to
time<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.120> would<00:02:49.330> play<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:50.790> fourth<00:02:51.790> or

time when I would play in fourth or
fifth<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.480> would<00:02:52.660> get<00:02:52.780> some<00:02:52.990> kind<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.380> step<00:02:54.310> well

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
fifth I would get some kind of step well

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
know now today in flames well positions

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.810 
know now today in flames well positions
I<00:03:23.230> can't<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:25.950> don't<00:03:26.950> intend<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.400> spend<00:03:27.580> the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
I can't and don't intend to spend the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.630 
I can't and don't intend to spend the
time<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.300> do<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.660> but<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.500> love<00:03:30.160> knowing<00:03:30.490> it's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
time to do it but I love knowing it's

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.390 
time to do it but I love knowing it's
there<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.750> even<00:03:32.050> if<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.200> can't<00:03:32.470> play<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.280> all

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
there and even if you can't play in all

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.970 
there and even if you can't play in all
those<00:03:33.580> positions<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.420> think<00:03:34.840> somehow<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> helps

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
those positions I think somehow it helps

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.510 
those positions I think somehow it helps
you<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> better<00:03:38.260> mental<00:03:38.950> image<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
you with a better mental image of the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.970 
you with a better mental image of the
heart<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.120> at<00:03:40.300> least<00:03:40.510> know<00:03:40.780> about<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.380> it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
heart and at least know about it it

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.290 
heart and at least know about it it
helps<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.820> what<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.120> already

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
helps you with with what you already

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.850 
helps you with with what you already
know<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.710> melody<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:46.690> some<00:03:47.020> positions<00:03:47.560> this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
know the melody for some positions this

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.030 
know the melody for some positions this
seems<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.430> lay<00:03:48.670> there<00:03:49.000> right<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.710> find

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
seems in lay there right and you find

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.450 
seems in lay there right and you find
what<00:03:51.360> position<00:03:52.360> fits<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.500> melody<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.190> best

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
what position fits the melody the best

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.630 
what position fits the melody the best
like<00:03:55.360> if<00:03:55.510> there's<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.810> note<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.830> want<00:03:57.520> to

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
like if there's a note and you want to

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.570 
like if there's a note and you want to
really<00:03:57.850> hold<00:03:58.240> and<00:03:58.780> put<00:03:59.590> some<00:03:59.770> feeling<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
really hold and put some feeling in and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.880 
really hold and put some feeling in and
needs<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.570> draw<00:04:01.870> note<00:04:02.170> maybe<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.740> it's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
needs to be a draw note maybe that it's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.950 
needs to be a draw note maybe that it's
not<00:04:03.070> a<00:04:03.100> drawn<00:04:03.430> open<00:04:03.790> another<00:04:04.090> position<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
not a drawn open another position so you

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.750 
not a drawn open another position so you
need<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.120> third<00:04:07.120> or<00:04:07.450> fifth<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:09.250> play<00:04:09.490> that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
need to have third or fifth to play that

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.510 
need to have third or fifth to play that
to<00:04:10.300> make<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.630> work<00:04:10.780> maybe<00:04:11.650> some<00:04:11.890> blown<00:04:12.130> over<00:04:12.400> on

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
to make it work maybe some blown over on

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.520 
to make it work maybe some blown over on
the<00:04:12.640> other<00:04:12.790> position<00:04:13.360> where<00:04:13.540> okay<00:04:13.840> you're

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
the other position where okay you're

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.410 
the other position where okay you're
playing<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.950> note<00:04:15.160> but<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.030> doesn't<00:04:16.270> have

something and thought maybe I might find
something<00:05:30.660> learn<00:05:31.530> something<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.360> started

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
something learn something and I started

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.659 
something learn something and I started
learning<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.200> little<00:05:34.380> bit<00:05:34.500> about<00:05:34.680> theory<00:05:35.490> I

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
learning a little bit about theory I

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.310 
learning a little bit about theory I
learned<00:05:35.880> about<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.240> circle<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.690> fifths<00:05:36.930> and

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
learned about the circle of fifths and

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.920 
learned about the circle of fifths and
learn<00:05:37.590> how<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:37.860> applies<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.180> positions

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
learn how that applies to the positions

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.390 
learn how that applies to the positions
and<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:42.300> opened<00:05:42.810> up<00:05:42.960> my<00:05:43.470> thinking<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.190> that

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
and that opened up my thinking of that

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.290 
and that opened up my thinking of that
music<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.300> never<00:05:46.280> had<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.310> music<00:05:47.700> teacher<00:05:47.910> and
