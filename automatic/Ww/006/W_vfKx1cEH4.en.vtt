00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.540 
again we have our presser foot pressure
at<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.210> top<00:00:40.450> here<00:00:40.809> if<00:00:41.079> you're<00:00:41.739> doing<00:00:41.980> quilts

and you've got a lot of wadding you can
release<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.489> turn<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.850> anti-clockwise<00:00:46.230> if

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
release it and turn it anti-clockwise if

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.919 
release it and turn it anti-clockwise if
you've<00:00:47.499> got<00:00:47.710> very<00:00:48.129> fine<00:00:48.579> fabric<00:00:48.999> and<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
you've got very fine fabric and the

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.919 
you've got very fine fabric and the
fabric<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:51.010> slipping<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:52.300> turn<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.780> clockwise

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
fabric is slipping you turn it clockwise

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.979 
fabric is slipping you turn it clockwise
and<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.980> gives<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:54.399> more<00:00:54.940> pressure<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.659> your

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
and it gives you more pressure on your

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.169 
and it gives you more pressure on your
foot<00:00:56.289> so<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.859> either<00:00:57.010> releases<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.030> pressure

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
foot so it either releases the pressure

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.319 
foot so it either releases the pressure
when<00:00:58.960> you've<00:00:59.109> got<00:00:59.350> thickness<00:01:00.010> or<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.760> tighten

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.140 
when you've got thickness or you tighten
it<00:01:01.449> so<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.019> turn<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.530> clockwise<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:03.640> get

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
it so you turn it clockwise to get
