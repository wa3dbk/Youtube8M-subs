00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.770
 always bright little things of sheep 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.290
 called this sexual dimorphism 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.590
 called this sexual dimorphism when 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.990
 one regiment you put one gender 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.359
 croup or smaller sound representatives 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.669
 of understandably bring the office here, too, he 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.380
 tracked here you notice that bright 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.859
 a little bit much but a little bit 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.780
 Noticeably they are less garantie cove 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.660
 The age of the subsidy gave that calculation of the horns 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.269
 increase for that is from April 1 to 1 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.579
 May superiority to that which is available 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.289
 rams is directly proportional to 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.629
 and here and because when evaluated by 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.050
 on a point scale, the bright ones should weigh 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:55.149
 less than rams according to the instructions and 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.440
 here is the excess of these requirements 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.890
 percent of start the same as among 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.620
 rams can not by weight the date and by 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.350
 weight but if rams weighs 50 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.550
 kilograms let's say like 48 here they are 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:17.710
 42 43 44 kilograms and bright 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:20.630
 from kid and on bright 32 kilograms bright on 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.220
 5 points 5 points sent 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.150
 Imagine two kilograms and at 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.150
 rams 35 bronchitis you 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 understandably 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.340
 these waterskins here and some take 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.729
 to show about her 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.729
 anything 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.079
 too, because they always put the animal 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.649
 says him 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.909
 his health and his future 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:18.560
 characteristic 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:22.370
 and a little more gentle turnout and shy 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:32.599
 the amount you need yes better I get up to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:34.760
 excuses I'm on but here everything is the same 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.480
 most yes that is, the back should not be 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 bend over 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.239
 I even myself from his not the same poetry 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:47.739
 what to females us but when she matures 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:53.650
 top still not looking the same 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:58.190
 but adil bali sheep doesn't give no blows 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.709
 we do not give but you do not know know the exact 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.329
 the amount there is a little practicing not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.549
 driven because he has a very high 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.230
 milkiness 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.049
 high high milk yield directly 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.420
 correlated with growth nigga is sick 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.180
 earliness but understand more 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.500
 milk the faster they grow 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.200
 this is one of the signs this is one of 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.230
 conditions mean precocity of a little century 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.609
 high watch little 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 besides they are genetically laid 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.120
 that is , there are a large number 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.709
 mother's milk and growth energy 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.940
 young animals together give here such a result 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.940
 everyone can let her go
