cool equipment coming out in the spring

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.560 
cool equipment coming out in the spring
just<00:00:14.400> found<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> internet<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
going to be reviewing the most the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.000 
going to be reviewing the most the
equipment<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> spring<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.710> read

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
equipment in the spring so as you read

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550 
equipment in the spring so as you read
that<00:00:23.130> they're<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:24.080> basically<00:00:25.080> saying<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
that they're just basically saying that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
that they're just basically saying that
they<00:00:25.740> tried<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.849> tested<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.660> for

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
they tried it just tested this out for

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.170 
they tried it just tested this out for
over<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> 1600<00:00:29.609> hours<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> should<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
over to the 1600 hours so it should be a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840 
over to the 1600 hours so it should be a
really<00:00:33.239> good<00:00:33.540> pat<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.460> some<00:00:35.460> key<00:00:35.640> points

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
really good pat on some key points

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.020 
really good pat on some key points
mobilities<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.200> 90<00:00:37.469> degree<00:00:37.940> angle<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
mobilities it's got 90 degree angle the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
mobilities it's got 90 degree angle the
soft<00:00:39.270> boot<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:40.020> more<00:00:40.200> flexibility<00:00:40.800> mobility

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
soft boot for more flexibility mobility

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.560 
soft boot for more flexibility mobility
as<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.460> good<00:00:44.910> great<00:00:45.360> still

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
as well so it's got good great still

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.270 
as well so it's got good great still
stability<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> flat<00:00:47.100> inside<00:00:47.579> edge

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
stability so it's got a flat inside edge

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.529 
stability so it's got a flat inside edge
sarah<00:00:52.340> says<00:00:53.340> balance<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> third

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
sarah says balance there for a third

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.189 
sarah says balance there for a third
point<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.530> basically<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:57.170> put<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
balancing birth lot basically it's got

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
balancing birth lot basically it's got
this<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:07.049> basically<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.650> quick<00:01:07.860> release

in the team pocket there so so there
won't<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.690> rebound<00:01:47.020> popping<00:01:47.440> out

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
won't be a rebound popping out

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.090 
won't be a rebound popping out
everywhere<00:01:48.720> stays<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.930> pocket<00:01:50.320> kind<00:01:51.010> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
everywhere stays the pocket kind of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.460 
everywhere stays the pocket kind of
absorbs<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.640> then<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.690> larger<00:01:53.020> talking

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470

binding<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:02.590> blocker<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:05.410> three<00:02:05.800> points

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
binding this blocker so three points

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.840 
binding this blocker so three points
balance<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:07.030> offset<00:02:07.450> pawn<00:02:07.750> gives<00:02:08.850> weight

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
balance the offset pawn gives weight

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
balance the offset pawn gives weight
balance<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.480> great<00:02:10.840> weight<00:02:11.050> belts<00:02:12.150> mobility

turbo it's got an adjustable cuff so

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.970 
turbo it's got an adjustable cuff so
given<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:19.060> larger<00:02:19.600> comfortable<00:02:20.290> opening<00:02:20.500> for

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
given a larger comfortable opening for

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
given a larger comfortable opening for
more<00:02:21.130> mobility<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:22.840> at<00:02:22.989> work<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
more mobility and then it's at work and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.160 
more mobility and then it's at work and
then<00:02:23.650> sharepoint<00:02:24.340> covered<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.850> protection<00:02:25.170> so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
then sharepoint covered in protection so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.990 
then sharepoint covered in protection so
it's<00:02:26.290> got<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.440> bind<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:26.860> Walker<00:02:27.190> face<00:02:27.610> and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it's got to bind this Walker face and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.070 
it's got to bind this Walker face and
that's<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> blocker<00:02:30.570> here's<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that's it to the blocker here's this the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.070 
that's it to the blocker here's this the
different<00:02:32.380> series<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.070> pads<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.660> get<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
different series so the pads you get the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.800 
different series so the pads you get the
