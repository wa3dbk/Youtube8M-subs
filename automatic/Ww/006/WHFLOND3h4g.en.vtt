 Hello, my name is Moses, I come from the group 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.320
 of the pea and I'm inviting you to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.750
 generate doubts we call your the 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.750
 skin to the action of turning the classroom 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
 you can also call use copy and the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 group we identify a movement 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.950
 like a leg 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 we started with a basic trick called 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.619
 the effect of the ball a pot we are going to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.910
 take the hoop right hand palms 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.840
 down and let's form a hand uve 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 right the way 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.310
 having that movement you have to form 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.380
 the final straight line v 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.630
 let's add the effect with the hand 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.610
 left the left is not going to be a 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.610
 total grip I 'll have here 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.210
 and make the illusion that we are 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.120
 noticing with the two on one side of the ubr 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.370
 will be open down will be the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.340
 transition from the other side will be left 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.340
 crossed we have open transition 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.490
 we have the boat 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.490
 we add open transition 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.890
 to add another effect 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.890
 let's make the pot but elongated 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.040
 for that the left hand makes a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.810
 grip without being left alone 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.630
 so 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.630
 we see the long boat and we combine it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.290
 in here, block a ball with a boat 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 elongate
