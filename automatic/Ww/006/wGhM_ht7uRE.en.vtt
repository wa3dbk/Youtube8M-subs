00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.010
 eastwood clint would say the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.840
 action video games are divided into two 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.119
 those who like to make noise and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.800
 fill your screen with fire and shots and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.140
 those who recreate themselves in silence and in 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.430
 discretion today we worship those 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.410
 titles that are loaded with 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.940
 spectacular but that do not solve 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.980
 all your situations with noise and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.720
 explosions we focus on those 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.970
 gems that have forced us to use 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.559
 head to overcome their challenges and that 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.390
 they have made us change surprises of the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.980
 trigger easy to become 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.980
 authentic lethal shadows 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.019
 there is something inside of many 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.519
 players that prevents them from enjoying a 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.680
 shooter in which everything is solved to 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.390
 Shots are missing when a title 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.309
 allows them to put their brains on point 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.530
 dead and move on with everything and with 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.449
 all instead to those same people 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 it produces an infinite satisfaction 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.170
 things like stopping a few minutes to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.299
 explore the scenario assess the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 different options and plan what should 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.530
 be the next step to take 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.340
 although it may seem that we speak 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.870
 always of very serious and realistic games 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.120
 the truth is that stealth encompasses 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.430
 releases of all kinds there are 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.200
 cartoon other characterized 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.420
 by complex plots blessed by 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.190
 reputed writers of success and even 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.910
 some with fantasy worlds or 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.910
 futurists 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.040
 but which was the first 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.560
 that honor probably corresponds to the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.450
 unforgettable castle wolfenstein no no and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.190
 wolfenstein 3d from haiti software that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 we all know and who is the father of 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.840
 shooters we talk about a game of 1981 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.190
 that to move forward he began to present the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.570
 study of the scenario and 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.570
 trajectories of the enemies 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 and it is that during the 80s the games of 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.640
 stealth were pretty arid but 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 then the first metal guide 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.750
 to revolutionize everything fun 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.700
 was guaranteed with this phenomenal 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.380
 adventure where to avoid eye contact 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.880
 with our enemies was so important 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.350
 how to be skillful with our 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.350
 movements to avoid cheating 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.330
 then more deliveries of the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.220
 series of kojima that delved into what 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.780
 that was just the starting point but 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.760
 also many other games that did 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.769
 evolve gender among the most 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.390
 Highlights has to be your one 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.220
 cult video game that was the first 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.220
 in betting on the three dimensions 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.069
 but it was not the only jewel we saw in 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.659
 the genre in that year for the memory and 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.180
 is that it also went on sale in the 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.769
 98 the unforgettable cinema a pioneer 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.930
 absolute when it comes to incorporating a 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.549
 bunch of items without which you do not know 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.390
 can understand the titles that would go 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.390
 arriving after 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.660
 as always happens with music 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.190
 cinema or video games and the thing was 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.349
 changing and we were watching mixtures 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.060
 bastards of genders especially in 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.800
 In recent years we have seen lots of 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.410
 mergers of stealth elements with 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.450
 shooters role titles superheroes or 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.580
 until horror games and even a 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.080
 saga as loud as call of duty is 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.030
 He dared to introduce elements of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.690
 planning and silent deaths with 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.690
 Very good results 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.890
 but of all these games what are 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.569
 the best 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.370
 that is if you are a fan of stealth 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.470
 which ones you can not miss 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.090
 3djuegos presents you its 10 titles 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.380
 favorites in this field 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.970
 those that you have to have in your 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.970
 collection if you love the genre 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.250
 there can not be a special about 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 stealth video games without having in 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.599
 account esprinters in the saga created under 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.520
 the supervision of the writer tom clancy 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.500
 It is one of the great references of this 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.300
 style and has enlightened sam fisher as 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.130
 one of the most representative heroes 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.959
 from the world lots of street 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.880
 situations to the limit and arguments 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.390
 complex and fascinating for one of the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.390
 indispensable 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.450
 but if we talk about titles that do not 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.329
 you can let go is bound to the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.439
 mention of the metal gear franchise 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.030
 probably the big name within 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.859
 this style its cast of protagonists 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.230
 is part of the annals of our 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.359
 history elevated kojima to the Olympus of 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.459
 the creatives and all their deliveries are 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.709
 gameplay guarantee and good scripts 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.269
 his popularity is such that he has even 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.530
 triggered an action spin-off 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.989
 developed by the always 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.620
 interesting platinum games and header 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.620
 by raiden 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.080
 on this same subject that so many and 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.669
 so many good stealth titles has 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.680
 gifted also treat the already 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.300
 mentioned tense the series is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.520
 set in the always fascinating 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.590
 Japan feudal and has a theme 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.900
 unbeatable for stealth as is that of 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.790
 girls although the last times its 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.710
 quality has gone down a lot in its 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.810
 origins was a precursor franchise 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.910
 in many senses of characteristics 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.040
 that would ultimately be decisive 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.669
 original is a classic that can not 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.669
 let go 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.430
 quite far from the triple-a style of 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.770
 these productions is the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.500
 great ninja frame one of the great 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.570
 surprises of 2012 with a 2d style that 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.520
 remember the jewels of the past the title 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.229
 mix action platforms and adventures 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.120
 with an approach that also drinks 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.080
 of the ninja charm to confuse us 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.080
 in the shadows 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.510
 following with the vintage releases 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.310
 we found you where he worked a 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.750
 young that he saw him another product 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.220
 surprising and groundbreaking that was the 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.050
 first to use concepts so 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.420
 important to go unnoticed 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.160
 as the darkness or the sound say that 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.020
 marked a before and after may sound 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.250
 something exaggerated for those who will not enjoy 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.470
 at the time of his murders 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.220
 mediaeval but it is fundamental to 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.220
 understand gender 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.590
 breaking completely with everything 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.750
 we've seen so far and looking at 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.670
 future is the series of a sex 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.500
 agree that it presents alternatives 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.480
 to overcome it to clean shot if we want 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.520
 but we will not deny that as more fun 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.960
 it turns out it's keeping quiet and thinking 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.960
 twice each step to take 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.190
 that you do not want fantasy political plots 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.530
 no stories from the past hitman is what 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.150
 yours with the legendary 47 we have 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.100
 converted in recent years into a 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.290
 cold and calculating elite assassin 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.300
 also here we can not leave puppet with 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.550
 head if we wish but remember that 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.050
 the true elite leaves no clues and makes 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.740
 that any death seems like a 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.740
 accident' 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.260
 sadly sly cooper is a franchise 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.210
 much less popular than the rest and that 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.910
 it's quite unfair to mix it 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.290
 platform adventures and stealth was almost 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.450
 perfect in some of your best 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.340
 episodes and the cartoon style what 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.510
 presence becomes a must for 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.510
 its unique component 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.730
 assassin's creed could not miss as 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.530
 I would say that we have plenty of reasons to 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.139
 stories of murderers few win to 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.940
 altair ezio and connor and you do not need 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.710
 remember that if you make a lot of noise in 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.440
 followed you have an entire army to your 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.780
 backs use the roofs do not build up ruckus 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.780
 and use the cleaver blade eaten 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.990
 how to close a story about games of 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.180
 stealth does not occur to us better way than 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.370
 with the surprise of 2012 and one of the 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.229
 best representatives of this genre 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.819
 honor brings together all the good things of the 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.740
 releases that we've seen in terms of 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.020
 great precious history 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.270
 graphic and incredible mechanics 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.009
 playable definitely one of the 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.130
 big and the last of our 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.130
 recommendations
