00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.200
 recently we saw the new brics 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.639
 projector a pretty complete model 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.610
 that offers great multimedia solutions 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.860
 with a small size in the video of 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.190
 today we will talk and see the new vix 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.840
 pro of gigabyte a very suitable model for 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.060
 gaming offering an impressive 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.820
 3d ability thanks to graphics 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.800
 intel iris pro 5200 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.259
 and processors and 57 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.699
 next we will see that it offers us 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.699
 this interesting brics pro 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.550
 the brics pro maintains the same philosophy 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 Compact design typical of the series 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.250
 bridge 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.500
 adding an intel core i5 processor or 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.739
 i7 high performance that includes 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.300
 gray intel pro 5200 graphics so that 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.940
 is ready for both applications 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.650
 who use the cpu intensively as 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.830
 for applications that require power 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.830
 graph 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 the power button on the unit 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 in one of the sides we have some 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 vents 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.890
 in the back besides the hdmi and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.460
 displayport we have the rj45 2 usb 3.0 and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.460
 the dc 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 in another lateral another grid of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.280
 ventilation 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.409
 and finally 2 usb 3.0 and a connector 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 for headphones and sp 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.829
 efe 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.100
 brics pro is available in black and 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.159
 red with selections between processors 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.180
 intel core i5 and i7 includes a module 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.430
 wifi and bluetooth mini pci preinstalled 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.290
 brics pro offers great flexibility to 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.780
 Allow to choose the size of your 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.210
 storage and system memory with 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.000
 two ports auding ddr3 in addition to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.459
 Support for the table is SSD or disk 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.660
 Hard of two and a half the novelty of brics 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.430
 pro is the intel soon 5200 since 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.730
 It is one of the first devices in 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.980
 implant it iris pro unsa cache drum de 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.989
 64 megabytes that eliminates the use of pipe 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.610
 lines in memory improving in shape 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.450
 impressive performance in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.370
 3d applications 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.959
 to use for the first time our 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.510
 bridge unit what we will have to do 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.040
 is open 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.989
 for this we will need a 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.959
 screwdriver and loosen the four 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.470
 screws once we have access to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.470
 its interior 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.140
 we will see the hole where we can ride 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.410
 our disk ssd or hard drive two and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.410
 medium 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.900
 we can see the connector of the table is 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.220
 the bluetooth wifi module 4.0 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.220
 the two ddr3 memory slots remind you 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.060
 that the memory has to be 135 of 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.459
 voltage 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.620
 finally we have here to connect a 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.790
 hard drive two and a half either a ssd 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 a hard drive convention 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.579
 for it as simple as mounting the 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.579
 memory 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.860
 and finally mount elements attack 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.950
 in the market you can find in that 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.190
 late any capacity at different 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.190
 prices 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.480
 as well 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.850
 we have the opportunity to be able 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 mount a hard drive two and a half 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.160
 this case I'm using a toilet 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.330
 once we have it all assembled 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.330
 we will proceed to put the lid 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.460
 corresponding 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.129
 and so in this way we will have our 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.129
 prepared unit 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.590
 I want to show the speed with which 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.490
 starts the reactive system in this case 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.900
 with 1000 28,174 maris will make the account 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.090
 you will see that since you press the button 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.010
 of ignition that arrived at the desk of 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.010
 windows barely spend 13 seconds 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.370
 the next step is to spend some beige 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.370
 bar in this case to the cinema of 11.5 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.490
 thanks to interest for 5,200 the result 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.490
 of tea open gl is quite high 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.250
 As for the result, the CPU is at 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.530
 pair of one and 5 of desktops for example 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.530
 15 47 60 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.729
 we have already seen how the brics is assembled 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.409
 pro we have already seen that it offers how to 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.269
 they carry benchmarks but 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.959
 which is able to make the bridge pro 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.959
 games 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.529
 in this case I tried the 44 in mode 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.149
 Bell 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.639
 the truth is that despite the reduced 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.439
 size of the pro bridge draws attention 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.979
 I can pull pretty well from the toilet 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.979
 5-4 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.479
 we all know the minimum requirements of 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.639
 84 but in this case thanks to the iris 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.580
 but 5200 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.430
 I could play with everything in ultra 1080p 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.260
 iu lv 51 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.980
 and at no time did he show 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.980
 Loss of performance 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.389
 in the images you can see 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.320
 the fluidity the details the reflections 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.320
 etc. sir
