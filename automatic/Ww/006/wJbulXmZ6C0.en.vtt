00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this for so long and thought I may never

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.270 
this for so long and thought I may never
happen<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:11.100> an<00:01:11.220> idea<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.470> remember<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.979> range

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
happen have an idea I remember my range

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
happen have an idea I remember my range
of<00:01:14.490> motion<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> small<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.590> hurt<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
of motion was so small that it hurt to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.870 
of motion was so small that it hurt to
turn<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.670> hand<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.290> took<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.830> whole<00:01:20.189> week<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
turn my hand so it took a whole week to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
turn my hand so it took a whole week to
get<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.780> range<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.409> motion<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
get my range of motion to be where I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.719 
get my range of motion to be where I
could<00:01:25.880> just

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
could just

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.149 
could just
draw<00:01:28.270> within<00:01:28.810> these<00:01:29.020> little<00:01:29.439> squares<00:01:29.799> and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
draw within these little squares and

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.450 
draw within these little squares and
draw<00:01:30.340> each<00:01:30.610> square<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.360> felt<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.320> had<00:01:32.350> gone<00:01:32.830> back

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
draw each square I felt I had gone back

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.920 
draw each square I felt I had gone back
to<00:01:33.850> square<00:01:34.240> one<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:35.830> did<00:01:36.130> change<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.780> it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
to square one and it did change but it's

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.130 
to square one and it did change but it's
amazing<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.680> changed<00:01:39.220> my<00:01:40.030> artwork<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.930> I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
amazing it changed my artwork and I

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.730 
amazing it changed my artwork and I
think<00:01:41.409> my<00:01:41.530> life<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.030> better<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:44.590> other

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
think my life for the better one other

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.800 
think my life for the better one other
thing<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.100> came<00:01:45.399> out<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.820> time<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.539> I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
thing that came out of that time is I

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.630 
thing that came out of that time is I
started<00:01:47.200> painting<00:01:47.500> differently

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
started painting differently

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120 
started painting differently
I<00:01:48.670> painted<00:01:49.420> very<00:01:49.869> realistic<00:01:50.649> up<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.979> that

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
I painted very realistic up to that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.039 
I painted very realistic up to that
point<00:01:51.490> but<00:01:51.729> because<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.149> didn't<00:01:52.840> have<00:01:53.020> that

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
point but because I didn't have that

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.690 
point but because I didn't have that
capacity<00:01:53.470> anymore

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
capacity anymore

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.669 
capacity anymore
I<00:01:55.649> started<00:01:56.649> painting<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.670> floor<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.679> then

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
I started painting on the floor and then

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.309 
I started painting on the floor and then
what<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.069> call<00:02:00.460> cosmic<00:02:01.050> Expressionism<00:02:02.050> came

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
what I call cosmic Expressionism came

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.529 
what I call cosmic Expressionism came
out<00:02:02.679> of<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.990> other<00:02:05.979> reasons<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.940> art

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
out of that now other reasons I art

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.139 
out of that now other reasons I art
journal<00:02:08.049> which<00:02:08.979> seem<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:10.030> of

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
journal which seem kind of

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.059 
journal which seem kind of
self-explanatory<00:02:10.539> but<00:02:11.290> sometimes<00:02:11.709> good<00:02:12.010> to

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
self-explanatory but sometimes good to

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.830 
self-explanatory but sometimes good to
hear<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:13.600> improve<00:02:14.230> myself<00:02:14.500> talk<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.720> be
