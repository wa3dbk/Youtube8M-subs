00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.570
 little different than it is a video so 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 boxing on xbox 360 and the invoice itself 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.800
 Who do you want to hd first I wanted 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 to say that I'm very very very talkative 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 because I'll finally be able to make videos 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.369
 with much more quality for you guys 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.039
 that accompany you know of my problem is 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 I record a lot of mech but it's not a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 very cool thing to be able to serve 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 xbox delights 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.989
 so I wanted to leave my 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.590
 thanks for control and move it 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.110
 granted xbox 360 and also for me already 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.420
 granted the word catch so I go 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.870
 to talk about you because that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.989
 I think and some situations for who 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 It is interesting, for example, to tell 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 You guys, I got a little curious. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 until I made this video so I've seen the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 xbox will be a school thing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:10.460
 now it's an xbox they can open box 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:02:00.090
 to box cable people find look that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.710
 day people are the stuffing 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:10.289
 I did not use it much, we were listening too much. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.530
 cool and of course the console that is the most 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:21.680
 cool but now let's go to the board 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.680
 capture the virgin is the dilma up to 80 p 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.950
 know it was one of the few that the chip 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:03:28.500
 so I did not arrive I got to see the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:03:32.700
 that you will be tested and also have a 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:40.459
 little lay and then I'm going to give a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.459
 a little better 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:56.069
 looks just a father ends there cables 11 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.780
 times the rod was, but I'm going to give a 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:10.410
 look after and board control and is 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:12.450
 this here or there the show then our 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.630
 footprint then some things will stay 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.030
 for you guys on this capture card and 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 because you do not know the cables I left 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.200
 here is the xbox 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.350
 he has I have seen some videos saying that 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.180
 it's good you use it so sometimes it breaks 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.550
 branch 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.240
 if you will travel through the works of 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.240
 lt consortium 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.600
 however the video quality of the cable 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:52.710
 original is better then if you can 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:57.120
 record with original site best plate 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.750
 Hi, this board here is the only one. 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.760
 sure is that she does not need the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.740
 computer to record 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.740
 so it's great for me that people 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.080
 anyway it's all put the components 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.080
 huh 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:28.440
 So you can here your team or the 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:32.669
 which is very good because this is a 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.030
 advantage is also an advantage because it is 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.440
 because it is not connected directly to the 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.600
 computer 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.670
 for the computer it has no input 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.950
 for your microphone then tell 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.750
 You do something that plays live. 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.270
 I think you walk to the insured who 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.090
 assumption that very good that use this 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.040
 mistress they fado you can then one 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.690
 recorder or suddenly we have a 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.630
 computer near you is not that 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.820
 O grace you so you can record 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.640
 along with you playing right? 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.280
 and as you can see he is all that 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.200
 cause a component he was looking for 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.260
 which is too bad if you like to record 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.110
 and ended up with the hdmi cable 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.690
 but it's a problem for you but I 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.770
 I honestly do not see it as a problem. 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.840
 great 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.420
 something else because it is not a 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.380
 board that is not attached directly to the 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.230
 computer 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.510
 she's not a star sign then 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.580
 if you want to see laires it is not only 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.010
 here from home so you can see on the website 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.930
 of the media the links back all here in the 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.500
 description is you can check out 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.240
 board 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.700
 you probably already have seen 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.760
 also a site card in the video of both 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.980
 the player talks and really is an act 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.169
 It's over then, how I told you I 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.270
 I'm half English, it 's a matter of course. 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.030
 capture card these things 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.400
 then one thing for you would be 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.169
 make my first recording together 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.260
 so I'll do it on video in 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.480
 some video is the band the game the first 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.640
 time with the card will be it will work 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.669
 so keep an eye out here on the cruise made 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.410
 So that's it, a few promotions. 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.900

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.570

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.550
 I 'll try to make the most of it. 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.110
 I can ask your question, I'll need it together. 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.980
 you also get used to it because it is also 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.660
 good for me 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.450

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.340
 clip liked and also subscribe 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.280
 especially now that she's just people 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.560
 has the answer is a caricature then the 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.930
 video is a really cool guy and a 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.940
 quality improves then that's it until the 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.940
 The next video was
