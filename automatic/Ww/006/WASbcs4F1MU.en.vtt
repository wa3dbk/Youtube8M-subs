00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 the 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.560
 in the 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.219
 hello my love and welcome to 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.160

 routine video I hope you like it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.630
 every morning starts with one for me 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.810
 I am a bit addicted to it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.670
 So children drink a coffee and 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.619
 does not even get tempted 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.949
 I like to design my breakfast 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.780
 with a shaker I use it 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.089
 instant oatmeal a banal 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.129
 raspberries and a bit of soy milk 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.760
 or sometimes quite normal milk ever 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.410
 after this 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.920
 I just think there is the perfect one 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.440
 start in the morning bread complains at 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.789
 always love me a little bit 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.520
 I'm just so healthy 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.070
 Sheikh and yes, that's fast 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.210
 and my ingredients always change 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 dance a bit 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.620
 during which is not wrong, it 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 awake in the morning is already the shake 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.750
 finished and it starts right with mine 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.750
 other things 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.020
 in the shower it is best to bond 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.900
 from l'oreal my avery shampoo i find 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 it is unbelievably good and takes care of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.659
 a lot of moisture as well as my bed 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.180
 knows conditioner and of course the flow 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 from richards and if I have it all 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 Together it can be directly in the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 shower when I'm done drinking 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.659
 Of course, I have my cap and enjoy 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.840
 him and start right at my face 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.180
 to work for a clear row and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.869
 use for my eyes of artdeco the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 new eye cream I leave my hair 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.340
 always dry a bit while I am 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.149
 make up and use this for me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.940
 grassers mean and just grab it 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.310
 in the lengths and in the tips and dre 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530
 me after that one so she is one 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.450
 Let it dry a little before I use it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.369
 I do not feel like it always 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.660
 directly looks very wet to fill that is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.739
 not very healthy either 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.870
 then I start with my way 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.299
 off and I use here for the first time 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.380
 primer of benefit and that 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.360
 professional 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.450
 I just knock him to the place 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.150
 my t zone where I always oily 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.100
 get skin and I think that's good 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 works but i believe it must 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.000
 everyone convinces himself 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.060
 next i use from maybelline 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.370
 my fit with concealer in the color 20 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.290
 under my eyes I always do it 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
 I prefer my foundation or 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 my brother is applying because I find that 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.019
 is me such a better coverage of the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.470
 next step is manual once 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.940
 bauer foundation of artdeco I will 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.010
 you all the products in the infobox 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.660
 link and I use it otherwise 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.450
 always with the nil technics basting 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 industry today but I have from cosmetics 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.860
 cosmo the rose used the brush and 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.770
 think of the combination very 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.770
 take as next I do not use 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.170
 I mean benefit bronze and the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.780
 I wear with the technology discount 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.760
 industry if you know more 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 want to be about my favorite industry 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.770
 I link you here once a video 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.810
 look at this a bit 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.750
 to use harmony in the face to conjure 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.610
 I also see the bronze in my eyes 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.840
 partie and use the zuewa 227 for this purpose 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.840
 software industry 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.620
 a little bit more time and more 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.140
 it goes directly as I have already mentioned 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.090
 I use video in my brush 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.360
 not much around the eyes around use 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.239
 but always a dark eyeshadow in 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.700
 the device and there I use 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.730
 once the eyeshadow of cosmetics 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.489
 Cosmo in the color black piste and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.250
 my favorite mascara from covergirl 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.959
 she quickly gets jobs 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.690
 I really did not try 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.569
 too stupid to select so that must 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.150
 you give me high as a small 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.359
 I then use one at the conclusion 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.360
 bright eyeshadow in the color edelweiss 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.270
 also from cosmetics case and wear 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.729
 with the brush once in the winkl 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 so that I shine a little bit more 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.440
 get that bit fresher looks 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.199
 then I use my body shop once 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.139
 face inbody brush and wear my art 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.300
 dÃ©co with blanche on i love these 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.669
 color i love this subtle coloring 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.840
 and I think that's easy 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.729
 do not do anything wrong 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.039
 I then use it as a conclusion 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:54.220
 once my art deco style ipcc all in 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:57.580
 the color 36 that's such a hat colors 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.759
 pink I touched roses 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.620
 thon I can not describe it 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.689
 In any case, very discreet and very 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.490
 Tempting from it shines a bit 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.530
 It has a glossy effect and I find it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.259
 just wonderful as next step 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.150
 I take care of my hair and me 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.659
 try them as rarely as possible 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.370
 to lead 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.219
 but find that the result with 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.840
 just found looks better and 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.479
 I use a whole here 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.780
 normal lead nothing special and 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.710
 find it without any structure 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.080
 sing a bit while dancing 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.300
 campaign a bit because that's saying 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.000
 It just takes me extremely long and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.250
 Now I'm just silly because like 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.800
 but said grace for an extremely long time 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.750
 lasts when i'm done using it 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.940
 I do not put any more products 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.580
 my hair is actually always medium or 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.150
 page vertices simply open and cope 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.940
 I'm actually kept then 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.250
 in the next step to follow here 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.430
 I once swap my outfit in 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.949
 my magic cupboard and have me 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.750
 now for a one piece of vero moda 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.759
 I actually always decided to go with it 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.099
 a black blazer still combine 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.900
 with a bit of jewelry aufpauldeln 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.520
 I sent this chain to bijou 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.310
 bought I think she is one 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.469
 wonderful accent and use it 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.930
 I still have a golden ring and am 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.900
 Ready because you love that's it 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.370

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.409

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.050

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.610
 thumbs up and of course 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.779
 numerous comments below we see 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.779
 look at next time
