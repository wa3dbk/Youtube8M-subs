towards the windshield if you want to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.440 
towards the windshield if you want to

not have any data in it and the reason
is<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.890> select<00:03:28.040> your<00:03:28.190> engine<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.819> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
is you have to select your engine on the

is you have to select your engine on the
bottom<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.450> we'll<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.140> here<00:03:30.200> we're

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
bottom right we'll do that here we're

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.830 
bottom right we'll do that here we're
going<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:30.860> look<00:03:31.549> at<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.730> LH<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:33.170> we<00:03:33.260> go<00:03:33.380> and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
going to look at the LH there we go and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.039 
going to look at the LH there we go and
here's<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.049> graph<00:03:37.330> there's<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.450> green<00:03:38.660> line<00:03:38.840> a

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
here's the graph there's a green line a

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.870 
here's the graph there's a green line a
blue<00:03:39.260> line<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.709> red<00:03:39.739> line<00:03:40.069> that<00:03:40.610> indicates

blue line and a red line that indicates

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120 
blue line and a red line that indicates
the<00:03:41.360> range<00:03:41.630> where<00:03:42.350> your<00:03:42.500> time<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.799> should<00:03:42.980> be

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
the range where your time you should be

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.759 
the range where your time you should be
closer<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.330> green<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.780> advanced<00:03:45.319> close<00:03:45.650> to

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
closer to the green is advanced close to

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.819 
closer to the green is advanced close to
the<00:03:45.890> red<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.450> retarded<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.380> want<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.739> be

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
the red is retarded so you want to be

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.729 
the red is retarded so you want to be
close<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.430> blue<00:03:49.579> line<00:03:49.790> as<00:03:49.940> possible<00:03:50.739> on

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
close to the blue line as possible on

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.380 
close to the blue line as possible on
this<00:03:51.859> car<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.160> timing<00:03:52.579> is<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.940> advanced<00:03:53.329> is

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
this car the timing is so advanced is

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.210 
this car the timing is so advanced is
off<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.720> chart<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.170> we'll<00:03:54.290> have<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.590> push<00:03:55.100> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
off the chart so we'll have to push the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280 
off the chart so we'll have to push the
timing<00:03:55.519> backwards<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.180> again<00:03:56.930> that's<00:03:57.140> by

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
timing backwards and again that's by

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.840 
timing backwards and again that's by
tapping<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.010> wrench<00:03:58.220> towards<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
tapping the wrench towards the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.180 
tapping the wrench towards the
windshield<00:03:59.230> we'll<00:04:00.230> bring<00:04:00.380> that<00:04:00.440> line<00:04:00.769> down<00:04:01.040> to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
windshield we'll bring that line down to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.550 
windshield we'll bring that line down to
closer<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.820> blue<00:04:02.000> area<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.570> hopefully

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
closer to the blue area and hopefully

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.319 
closer to the blue area and hopefully
we'll<00:04:03.709> get<00:04:03.829> it<00:04:03.890> on<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.160> first<00:04:04.310> try<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.150> if<00:04:05.239> we

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
we'll get it on the first try but if we

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.460 
we'll get it on the first try but if we
don't<00:04:05.450> we'll<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:05.930> repeat<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.290> process

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
don't we'll just repeat this process

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.979 
don't we'll just repeat this process
until<00:04:06.890> we<00:04:07.250> get<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.690> after<00:04:08.690> you're<00:04:08.840> done

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
until we get it after you're done

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.080 
until we get it after you're done
looking<00:04:09.859> at<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.010> timing<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.640> want<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:10.910> close

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
looking at the timing you want to close

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.490 
looking at the timing you want to close
this<00:04:11.239> window<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.570> then<00:04:11.780> completely<00:04:12.170> closed

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
this window and then completely closed
