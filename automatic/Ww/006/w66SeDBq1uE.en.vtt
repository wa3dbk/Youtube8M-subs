00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.889
 hydrogen and oxygen we will use a fuel cell 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.229
 of the sea sister 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.249
 Tunisia 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 only distilled water 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.990
 set up the plugs 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 Thu 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.880
 at the same time this fuel cell riverside energized it behaves 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.700
 like an electrolyser do not go over without forgetting to do 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 mount it must also avoid a controller in the circuit 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 adjusted the intensity of the current 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.750
 we are refueling 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 the release of hydrogen and twice that of oxygen 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.870
 we save water 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.190
 Warning 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 you must not use 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.939
 distilled water 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.790
 in this fuel cell 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.640
 so we do not have 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.639
 of the oxygen and hydrogen reserve 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 but I know how the fuel cell works 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.160
 set up our fuel cell with its tanks 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.719
 grumpy 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 eyi on the way to the adventurous 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.529
 it's the car of tomorrow 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.299
 but it already exists 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.659
 here is the h2o vehicle developed by psa group 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.409
 two days citroën 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.790
 this electric vehicle uses batteries and fuel cells to 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.259
 hydrogen 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.979
 the technical solutions used for storing hydrogen and the 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.439
 battery operation 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.629
 allow h2o to intervene in complete human security with claims 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.679
 for oxygen becomes scarce 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.159
 like underground parking fees where tunnel faults 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.159
 h2o not a range of 300 km 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.020
 5 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.069
 an easter taxi was also developed by psa peugeot 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.409
 citroën 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.469
 this taxi 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.550
 also works with hydrogen fuel cells 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.750
 hydrogen is stored under pressure in removable racks 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.310
 this taxi to carry four people 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.990
 300 km 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.880
