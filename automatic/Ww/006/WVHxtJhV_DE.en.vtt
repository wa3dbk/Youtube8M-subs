00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.679 
black and white video and I don't think
that<00:01:54.100> many<00:01:54.280> people<00:01:54.549> watched<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:55.030> YouTube<00:01:55.509> is

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
that many people watched it YouTube is

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.410 
that many people watched it YouTube is
like<00:01:55.780> being<00:01:55.990> in<00:01:56.110> public<00:01:57.030> YouTube<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.270> like

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
like being in public YouTube is like

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.450 
like being in public YouTube is like
being<00:01:58.659> in<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.930> real<00:01:59.200> world<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.860> when<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.250> put

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
being in the real world and when you put

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.240 
being in the real world and when you put
an<00:02:00.579> opinion<00:02:00.969> out<00:02:01.060> there<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:02.039> even<00:02:03.039> if<00:02:03.159> you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
an opinion out there and even if you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.429 
an opinion out there and even if you
have<00:02:03.399> research<00:02:03.880> behind<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.420> if<00:02:04.990> you're<00:02:05.229> just

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
have research behind it if you're just

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.170 
have research behind it if you're just
talking<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.100> your<00:02:06.250> ass<00:02:06.340> or<00:02:06.909> whatever

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
talking out of your ass or whatever

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.840 
talking out of your ass or whatever
people<00:02:08.170> are<00:02:08.410> gonna<00:02:08.560> respond<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.250> both

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
people are gonna respond to it both

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.030 
people are gonna respond to it both
positively<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.630> negatively<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.680> think

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
positively and negatively and I think

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.500 
positively and negatively and I think
the<00:02:12.190> biggest<00:02:12.400> problem<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:13.359> when

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the biggest problem is is that when

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.150 
the biggest problem is is that when
people<00:02:13.660> get<00:02:13.870> negative<00:02:14.109> responses<00:02:14.859> to<00:02:15.040> their

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
people get negative responses to their

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
people get negative responses to their
videos<00:02:15.489> whether<00:02:15.790> they've<00:02:15.970> done<00:02:16.150> research<00:02:16.570> on

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
videos whether they've done research on

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.110 
videos whether they've done research on
their<00:02:16.989> opinion<00:02:17.380> or<00:02:17.500> not<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:18.790> take<00:02:19.000> it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
their opinion or not they take it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840 
their opinion or not they take it
personal<00:02:19.720> they<00:02:20.350> don't<00:02:21.130> just<00:02:21.430> say<00:02:21.549> okay<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
personal they don't just say okay I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.460 
personal they don't just say okay I
respect<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> fact<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.989> disagree<00:02:23.440> with

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
respect the fact that you disagree with

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.850 
respect the fact that you disagree with
me<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.690> gonna<00:02:25.780> move<00:02:25.989> on<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.500> even<00:02:26.769> if

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
me and I'm just gonna move on or even if

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.020 
me and I'm just gonna move on or even if
you<00:02:26.950> know<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.069> get<00:02:27.280> trolled<00:02:27.640> all<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.120> time<00:02:28.390> and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
you know I get trolled all the time and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.730 
you know I get trolled all the time and
you<00:02:29.540> know<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.840> get<00:02:29.959> trolled<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.440> someone

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
you know if you get trolled and someone

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.740 
you know if you get trolled and someone
calls<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.190> piece<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.610> shit<00:02:31.819> like<00:02:32.150> who<00:02:32.390> cares

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
calls you a piece of shit like who cares

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.870 
calls you a piece of shit like who cares
but<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> problem<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.250> people<00:02:34.430> can't

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
but the problem is is that people can't

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.790 
but the problem is is that people can't
accept<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.420> someone<00:02:35.720> disagrees<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:36.440> them

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
accept that someone disagrees with them

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.699 
accept that someone disagrees with them
and<00:02:37.330> either<00:02:38.330> they'll<00:02:38.630> fight<00:02:39.020> with<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> person

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and either they'll fight with a person

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.530 
and either they'll fight with a person
and<00:02:39.800> try<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.130> make<00:02:40.400> them<00:02:40.580> agree<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.330> their

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and try to make them agree with their

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.350 
and try to make them agree with their
opinion<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:43.010> fact<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.700> they'll

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
opinion like it's fact or they'll

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.330 
opinion like it's fact or they'll
actually<00:02:44.569> personally<00:02:45.230> go<00:02:45.350> after<00:02:45.800> these

actually personally go after these

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.120 
actually personally go after these
people<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.090> they<00:02:47.510> expect<00:02:48.319> not<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.830> called

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
people and they expect not to be called

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.340 
people and they expect not to be called
out<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.819> said<00:02:49.850> before<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.870> have<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.200> I
