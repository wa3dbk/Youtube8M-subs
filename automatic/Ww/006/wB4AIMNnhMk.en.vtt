which<00:00:29.279> also<00:00:29.490> comes<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:36.320> torsion<00:00:37.320> springs<00:00:37.760> so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
which also comes with torsion springs so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
which also comes with torsion springs so
I<00:00:39.210> gave<00:00:40.020> them<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:41.719> Haven<00:00:42.719> my<00:00:43.050> measurement<00:00:43.590> for

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I gave them my Haven my measurement for

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.930 
I gave them my Haven my measurement for
my<00:00:45.059> garage<00:00:45.239> doors<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> weight<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
my garage doors and the weight of the

the ceiling the height of the door and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.240 
the ceiling the height of the door and
they<00:00:53.210> figured<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.379> what<00:00:55.379> size<00:00:55.620> Springs<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
they figured out what size Springs I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.270 
they figured out what size Springs I
needed<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.930> lift<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.559> need<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
needed and how much lift I need it and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.420 
needed and how much lift I need it and
 male<00:01:00.120> stop<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.949> it's<00:01:01.949> actually<00:01:02.100> pretty

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
 male stop so it's actually pretty

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.830 
 male stop so it's actually pretty
decent

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
decent

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
decent
when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> install<00:01:04.260> high<00:01:04.439> lift<00:01:04.650> kick<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
when you install high lift kick that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
when you install high lift kick that
means<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.470> cable<00:01:07.470> running<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
means you have more cable running to the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
means you have more cable running to the
bottom<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.549> door<00:01:08.930> which<00:01:09.930> means<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
bottom of your door which means that you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
bottom of your door which means that you
have<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> change<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.130> drums<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.270> also

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
have to change your drums so they also

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
have to change your drums so they also
send<00:01:15.840> new<00:01:16.530> cables<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:18.110> new<00:01:19.110> drums<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.700> old

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
send new cables and new drums so the old

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
send new cables and new drums so the old
drums<00:01:21.650> are<00:01:22.850> basically<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.659> skinny<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
drums are basically that skinny and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.330 
drums are basically that skinny and
these<00:01:25.530> new<00:01:25.740> drums<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.640> stepped-up

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
these new drums have these stepped-up

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.510 
these new drums have these stepped-up
rings<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.150> anyway<00:01:30.590> I'll<00:01:31.590> attempt<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> install

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
rings so anyway I'll attempt to install

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.990 
rings so anyway I'll attempt to install

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
use the block of wood just because it's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.469 
use the block of wood just because it's
so<00:02:07.259> darn<00:02:07.530> easy<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.119> exact

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
horizontal cut that I I have to do this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.210 
horizontal cut that I I have to do this
side<00:02:20.660> now<00:02:20.870> that's<00:02:21.440> what<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:21.710> gonna<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:22.040> now

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.140 
torsion bar setup take these old drums
off<00:02:26.840> take<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> old<00:02:27.620> springs<00:02:28.010> off<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.060> I'm

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
off take the old springs off and I'm

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.740 
off take the old springs off and I'm
trying<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.510> figure<00:02:29.720> out<00:02:29.990> how<00:02:30.710> this<00:02:31.720> works<00:02:32.720> I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
trying to figure out how this works I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.000 
trying to figure out how this works I
see<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.900> there's<00:02:36.080> two<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.380> them<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.860> that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
see that there's two of them I see that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.980 
see that there's two of them I see that
there's<00:02:37.190> no<00:02:37.370> wear<00:02:37.640> marks<00:02:37.970> on<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.330> inside<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
there's no wear marks on the inside and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.620 
there's no wear marks on the inside and
there's<00:02:39.710> wear<00:02:39.920> marks<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.430> both<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.000> side<00:02:41.060> so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
there's wear marks on both this side so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.910 
there's wear marks on both this side so
clearly<00:02:42.110> they're<00:02:42.410> mounted<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:44.920> with

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
clearly they're mounted like that with

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.150 
clearly they're mounted like that with
this<00:02:46.100> being<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> top<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:49.100> can<00:02:49.820> see<00:02:50.090> bolt<00:02:51.160> where

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this being the top I can see bolt where

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.420 
this being the top I can see bolt where
marks<00:02:52.550> there<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.270> these<00:02:53.480> bolts<00:02:53.990> here

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
marks there so these bolts here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.340 
marks there so these bolts here
definitely<00:02:55.430> came<00:02:56.300> through<00:02:56.330> -<00:02:56.810> they're<00:02:57.020> two

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
definitely came through - they're two

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.590 
definitely came through - they're two
separate<00:02:57.770> ones

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
separate ones

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.320 
separate ones
there's<00:03:00.110> both<00:03:00.410> were<00:03:00.590> marks<00:03:01.010> there<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.760> there

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
there's both were marks there and there

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.480 
there's both were marks there and there
they<00:03:03.170> were<00:03:03.230> mounted<00:03:03.440> separately<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.310> almost

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
they were mounted separately I almost

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.350 
they were mounted separately I almost
think<00:03:04.820> they<00:03:05.030> were<00:03:05.090> mounted<00:03:05.600> just<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:06.680> that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.610 

really<00:03:11.360> hard<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.660> tell<00:03:11.900> though<00:03:12.110> because<00:03:12.290> these

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
really hard to tell though because these

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.990 
really hard to tell though because these
two<00:03:12.920> things<00:03:13.390> kind<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.540> make<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.690> look<00:03:14.930> like

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
two things kind of make it look like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.900 
two things kind of make it look like
they<00:03:17.000> were<00:03:17.030> mounted<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:19.280> know<00:03:19.370> what<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.610> guess

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
they were mounted you know what I guess

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.510 
they were mounted you know what I guess
I<00:03:20.090> didn't<00:03:20.420> see<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:20.780> before<00:03:20.840> check<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.680> out

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
I didn't see this before check this out

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.560 
I didn't see this before check this out
so<00:03:23.300> this<00:03:23.840> was<00:03:24.260> probably<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:26.330> was

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
so this was probably here this was

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.130 
so this was probably here this was
probably<00:03:26.840> here<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:29.060> this<00:03:29.330> one<00:03:29.540> was<00:03:29.720> mounted

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
probably here and this one was mounted

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.000 
probably here and this one was mounted
over<00:03:30.440> here<00:03:30.709> legis<00:03:31.190> all<00:03:31.459> right<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.680> Vons

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
over here legis all right and this Vons

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.800 
over here legis all right and this Vons
was<00:03:34.280> mounted<00:03:34.790> right<00:03:35.120> here

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
was mounted right here

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.090 
was mounted right here
a<00:03:35.840> lucky<00:03:36.530> soul<00:03:38.200> that's<00:03:39.200> probably<00:03:39.680> how<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:39.890> was

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
a lucky soul that's probably how it was

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.530 
a lucky soul that's probably how it was
doing<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.470> yes<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:42.770> how<00:03:42.950> I'll<00:03:43.070> do<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.540> I'm

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
doing so yes that's how I'll do it I'm

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.090 
doing so yes that's how I'll do it I'm
gonna<00:03:44.750> need<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.170> put<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:46.130> nailer<00:03:47.110> aboard<00:03:48.110> right

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
gonna need to put a nailer aboard right

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.250 
gonna need to put a nailer aboard right
in<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.280> middle<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.850> area<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.540> mount

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
in the middle of that area to mount

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.030 
in the middle of that area to mount
those<00:03:51.470> things<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:53.540> things<00:03:53.810> mount<00:03:54.200> somehow

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
those things these things mount somehow

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.130 
those things these things mount somehow
I<00:03:55.370> don't<00:03:55.760> know<00:03:56.000> if<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.420> bottom<00:03:56.870> or<00:03:57.050> if

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
I don't know if this is the bottom or if

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.120 
I don't know if this is the bottom or if
this<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.530> top<00:03:58.780> doesn't<00:03:59.780> say

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
this is the top doesn't say

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.270 
this is the top doesn't say
what<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.520> now<00:04:06.530> chances<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.950> that

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
what it is is it now chances are that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.930 
what it is is it now chances are that
means<00:04:09.290> allowed<00:04:10.290> there's<00:04:10.920> getting<00:04:11.130> probably

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
means allowed there's getting probably

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.210 
means allowed there's getting probably
means<00:04:12.270> left<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.560> if<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:13.830> left<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.430> would<00:04:14.610> be

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.580 

like<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:21.450> that's<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.870> top<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:22.530> know

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
like that so that's the top I don't know

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.730 
like that so that's the top I don't know
what<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:23.040> connects<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:24.230> it's<00:04:25.230> kind<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.530> weird

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
what that connects to it's kind of weird

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.320 
what that connects to it's kind of weird
I<00:04:26.100> would<00:04:26.370> assume<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.970> would<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.150> like

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
I would assume that it would be like

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.870 
I would assume that it would be like
this

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
this

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.790 
this
you<00:04:29.880> know<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:32.750> think<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:34.110> actually<00:04:34.470> goes<00:04:34.620> like

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you know I think it actually goes like

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.170 
you know I think it actually goes like
that<00:04:35.010> well<00:04:35.190> why<00:04:35.310> would<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.790> an<00:04:35.910> analog

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
that well why would that have an analog

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.790 
that well why would that have an analog
what's<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.630> other<00:04:36.720> side<00:04:36.960> say<00:04:37.880> NL<00:04:39.530> our<00:04:41.120> purses

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
what's the other side say NL our purses

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.250 
what's the other side say NL our purses
so<00:04:43.800> Oh<00:04:44.220> what<00:04:45.180> if<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.360> went<00:04:45.480> like<00:04:45.720> this

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
so Oh what if it went like this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.400 
so Oh what if it went like this
uh-huh<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:46.920> how<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.310> goes<00:04:47.690> all<00:04:48.690> right<00:04:48.840> so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
uh-huh that's how it goes all right so

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.880 
uh-huh that's how it goes all right so
it<00:04:49.680> goes<00:04:49.860> like<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:51.350> amounts<00:04:52.350> on<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.680> land

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
it goes like that amounts on the land

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.640 
it goes like that amounts on the land
like<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:53.610> above<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:55.350> top<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:56.070> track<00:04:56.370> huh

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
like so above the top of the track huh

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.350 
like so above the top of the track huh
and<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.740> get<00:04:58.980> I<00:04:59.010> bet<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.790> could<00:04:59.970> mount<00:05:00.150> it

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
and I get I bet you could mount it

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.420 
and I get I bet you could mount it
absolutely<00:05:00.960> anywhere<00:05:01.260> up<00:05:01.710> there<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.070> wanted

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
absolutely anywhere up there you wanted

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.580 
absolutely anywhere up there you wanted
to<00:05:02.690> sometimes<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.750> had<00:05:03.840> enough<00:05:03.990> length<00:05:04.260> in

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
to sometimes you had enough length in

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.980 
to sometimes you had enough length in
your<00:05:05.540> cable<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.700> anyway<00:05:08.700> instead<00:05:09.450> of<00:05:09.780> talking

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
your cable so anyway instead of talking

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.780 
your cable so anyway instead of talking
about<00:05:10.140> this<00:05:10.470> I'm<00:05:10.980> gonna<00:05:11.220> put<00:05:11.430> up<00:05:11.520> another

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
about this I'm gonna put up another

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.110 
about this I'm gonna put up another
horizontal<00:05:12.120> track<00:05:13.310> which<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.340> terrible

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
horizontal track which is terrible

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080 
horizontal track which is terrible
because<00:05:15.270> it's<00:05:15.660> like<00:05:16.100> 14<00:05:17.100> feet<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.610> air<00:05:17.670> and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
because it's like 14 feet in the air and

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.410 
because it's like 14 feet in the air and
I'm<00:05:18.270> gonna<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.920> ladder<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.610> not<00:05:20.820> even<00:05:21.330> a

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
I'm gonna the ladder this is not even a

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.200 
I'm gonna the ladder this is not even a
ladder<00:05:21.600> like<00:05:22.080> it's<00:05:22.620> shaped<00:05:22.980> like<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.280> ladder<00:05:23.550> it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
ladder like it's shaped like a ladder it

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.600 
ladder like it's shaped like a ladder it
looks<00:05:24.570> like<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.810> ladder<00:05:25.080> but<00:05:25.580> like

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.919 

like<00:05:31.610> there's<00:05:31.879> zero<00:05:32.629> stability<00:05:33.409> at<00:05:33.529> all<00:05:34.539> so<00:05:35.539> I

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:35.929 
like there's zero stability at all so I

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:39.489 
like there's zero stability at all so I
think<00:05:36.080> this<00:05:36.379> is<00:05:36.589> actually<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:37.339> rare<00:05:38.499> aluminum

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:39.499 
think this is actually a rare aluminum

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:44.199 
think this is actually a rare aluminum
ladder<00:05:39.769> replica<00:05:42.039> so<00:05:43.039> yeah<00:05:43.369> that's<00:05:43.939> our<00:05:44.059> gonna

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:44.209 
ladder replica so yeah that's our gonna

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:52.929 
ladder replica so yeah that's our gonna
do<00:05:46.029> i<00:05:47.029> don't<00:05:47.419> i<00:05:50.439> had<00:05:51.439> to<00:05:51.589> drill<00:05:51.889> out<00:05:52.039> this

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:52.939 
do i don't i had to drill out this

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.629 
do i don't i had to drill out this
upright<00:05:53.389> and<00:05:53.719> build<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:55.009> little<00:05:55.249> bracket

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
upright and build the little bracket

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.979 
upright and build the little bracket
thing<00:05:55.819> i<00:05:55.969> think<00:05:56.119> i'm<00:05:56.209> gonna<00:05:56.300> do<00:05:56.509> that<00:05:56.539> on<00:05:56.839> the

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:56.989 
thing i think i'm gonna do that on the

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:03.999 
thing i think i'm gonna do that on the
ground<00:05:57.349> this<00:05:57.709> time<00:05:57.969> instead<00:05:58.969> of<00:06:02.860> instead<00:06:03.860> of

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
ground this time instead of instead of

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.749 
ground this time instead of instead of
trying<00:06:04.489> to<00:06:04.610> do<00:06:05.269> it<00:06:05.389> up<00:06:05.479> in<00:06:05.569> the<00:06:05.719> air<00:06:05.869> so<00:06:06.289> that's

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.100 

next<00:06:10.759> we're<00:06:10.969> gonna<00:06:11.029> do<00:06:12.279> enjoy<00:06:13.779> so<00:06:14.779> there<00:06:14.959> it<00:06:15.019> is

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
next we're gonna do enjoy so there it is

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.879 
next we're gonna do enjoy so there it is
the<00:06:15.739> second<00:06:16.309> horizontal<00:06:16.819> is<00:06:16.909> installed<00:06:20.889> that

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
the second horizontal is installed that

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.549 
the second horizontal is installed that
took<00:06:22.189> like<00:06:22.429> 15<00:06:23.059> 20<00:06:23.629> minutes<00:06:23.899> this<00:06:24.229> one<00:06:24.409> took

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:24.559 
took like 15 20 minutes this one took

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.819 
took like 15 20 minutes this one took
plenty<00:06:24.829> hour<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:25.909> a<00:06:25.939> half<00:06:26.119> so<00:06:26.829> there's

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:27.829 
plenty hour and a half so there's

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.729 
plenty hour and a half so there's
apparently<00:06:28.729> a<00:06:28.969> learning<00:06:29.269> curve<00:06:29.449> but<00:06:29.749> i<00:06:30.349> knew

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:30.739 
apparently a learning curve but i knew

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.019 
apparently a learning curve but i knew
exactly<00:06:30.860> what<00:06:31.129> i<00:06:31.309> needed<00:06:31.519> to<00:06:31.639> do<00:06:31.789> for<00:06:31.939> the

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
exactly what i needed to do for the

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.839 
exactly what i needed to do for the
second<00:06:32.300> one<00:06:32.419> so<00:06:32.719> now<00:06:32.869> i'm<00:06:33.829> gonna<00:06:34.490> put<00:06:34.699> in<00:06:34.789> the

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
second one so now i'm gonna put in the

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:43.500 
second one so now i'm gonna put in the
torsion<00:06:35.179> bar

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.570
