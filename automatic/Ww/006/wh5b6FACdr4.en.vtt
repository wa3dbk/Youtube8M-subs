00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.319
 consider just a terrific mod with 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 by which you can transform 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 in absolutely any mob here for example like 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.110
 i just transformed from a dog 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.030
 and in yourself 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 Well, in order to transform into 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 some mob to you first 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 take his killers well for example 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.670
 let's kill the rats as you can see after 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.949
 of how we did it little by little in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 we are transforming it on the very same 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570
 business is very, very cool because not always 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.740
 you will manage to play for a rat 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.960
 minecraft 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 well let's say we played enough for this 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.390
 rat and want to transform back 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.610
 what do we need to do for this and for 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.469
 we need to configure this first 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 buttons with which we will 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.780
 switch between characters a for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 this we open the main menu click 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 settings then control at the very bottom 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.309
 list we need to find the inscription morph 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.350
 Keynes and then click on the next button 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.109
 now as you can see we have more 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 detailed settings menu from this mod 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 the only thing you need from this 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.439
 set up these two buttons 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 you can put absolutely any keys 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.420
 but I recommend you put here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 arrow up button and here arrow 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.090
 down although basically you can do 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 as I have under one and us for 2 but 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.680
 what do we turn off the settings menu and now 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 we need to change our rat so to speak 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 on the usual yourself you can do it 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.790
 by simply pressing the buttons that you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.340
 set in the settings in this case 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 it's on amp from 1 and us by 2 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.540
 well and after you switched and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.909
 have chosen your character in which you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.400
 you will be transformed just click 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.250
 the enter key and as you can see how it would be 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 it didn't sound we start 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.759
 transformed a what is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.700
 It really looks very, very 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.829
 great in general in this way you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 can transform absolutely in 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.450
 any mob but what if you play 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.820
 multiplayer then you can turn 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 even in the player but for example you will kill 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 my friend then turn him into me 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 I think when he sees you he will be in 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.959
 serious shock well or for example you can 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 turn into some wolf cub and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.790
 just watch what your doing 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.250
 friend well or otherwise just follow him 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.530
 spying in general I hope this 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.920
 You liked the mod and I hope that you 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.420

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.520
