00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
I kind of found a little struggle with

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.650 
I kind of found a little struggle with
this<00:04:34.900> is<00:04:35.140> actually<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.700> buttons<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.360> the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
this is actually the the buttons on the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.470 
this is actually the the buttons on the
side<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:38.680> wasn't<00:04:39.190> as<00:04:39.370> impressed<00:04:40.240> with<00:04:40.390> the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
side I wasn't as impressed with the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.770 
side I wasn't as impressed with the
button<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.860> side<00:04:42.430> buttons<00:04:42.820> as<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.060> thought<00:04:43.750> I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
button the side buttons as I thought I

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.710 
button the side buttons as I thought I
would<00:04:44.080> be<00:04:44.320> they<00:04:45.220> kind<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.550> really<00:04:45.790> take<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.270> nice

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
would be they kind of really take a nice

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.640 
would be they kind of really take a nice
amount<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.260> push<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.720> really<00:04:49.720> nice<00:04:50.200> amount<00:04:50.500> of

touch to the right-about may be right

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.260 
touch to the right-about may be right
there<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.060> camera<00:05:43.450> is<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:44.230> light<00:05:44.860> sensor

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
there of the camera is a a light sensor

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.330 
there of the camera is a a light sensor
you<00:05:46.270> can't<00:05:46.540> really<00:05:46.720> see<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:47.050> that<00:05:47.140> well<00:05:47.470> unless

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
you can't really see it that well unless

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.770 
you can't really see it that well unless
you're<00:05:48.520> looking<00:05:48.730> at<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:48.970> as<00:05:49.090> an<00:05:49.150> angle<00:05:49.540> and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
you're looking at it as an angle and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.750 
you're looking at it as an angle and
what<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.320> does<00:05:50.530> is<00:05:50.590> if<00:05:50.950> you<00:05:51.220> have<00:05:51.250> auto

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
what that does is if you have auto

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.880 
what that does is if you have auto
brightness<00:05:52.060> on<00:05:52.420> on<00:05:52.660> your<00:05:52.780> ipod<00:05:53.080> touch<00:05:53.380> or<00:05:53.650> your

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
brightness on on your ipod touch or your

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.230 
brightness on on your ipod touch or your
iphone<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:55.570> will<00:05:55.780> adjust<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.950> brightness<00:05:57.240> but

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
iphone it will adjust the brightness but

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.040 
iphone it will adjust the brightness but
with<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:59.530> case<00:06:00.010> on<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.940> really<00:06:01.630> covers<00:06:01.840> that

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
with the case on it really covers that

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.530 
with the case on it really covers that
up<00:06:02.230> so<00:06:02.410> you<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.650> auto<00:06:02.860> brightness<00:06:03.130> on

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
up so you have auto brightness on

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.000 
up so you have auto brightness on
remember<00:06:04.540> to<00:06:04.630> turn<00:06:04.810> auto<00:06:05.050> brightness<00:06:05.290> off<00:06:05.710> and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
remember to turn auto brightness off and

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.490 
remember to turn auto brightness off and
adjust<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.460> accordingly<00:06:07.080> that<00:06:08.080> is<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.350> only

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
adjust it accordingly that is the only

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.400 
adjust it accordingly that is the only
downside<00:06:09.280> really<00:06:09.670> to<00:06:09.820> this<00:06:09.940> phone<00:06:10.410> besides

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
downside really to this phone besides

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.500 
downside really to this phone besides
the<00:06:11.680> buttons<00:06:12.010> but<00:06:12.340> I<00:06:12.520> really<00:06:13.000> kind<00:06:13.210> of<00:06:13.300> gotten

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
past the buttons but another thing to

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.290 
past the buttons but another thing to
say<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.070> you<00:06:18.280> know<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.730> is<00:06:18.760> kind<00:06:19.030> of<00:06:19.090> for<00:06:19.240> the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
say is you know this is kind of for the
