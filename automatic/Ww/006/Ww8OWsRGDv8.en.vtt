00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
play a song by ear just by utilizing the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
play a song by ear just by utilizing the
process<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.279> elimination<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:06.720> only<00:00:06.870> have

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
process of elimination we only have

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
process of elimination we only have
three<00:00:07.259> different<00:00:07.410> ways<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.770> play<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> chord<00:00:08.189> we

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
three different ways to play a chord we

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.390 
three different ways to play a chord we
can<00:00:08.460> play<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.790> here<00:00:09.090> here<00:00:09.809> or<00:00:10.260> here<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.920> that's

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
can play up here here or here and that's

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.620 
can play up here here or here and that's
it<00:00:11.639> we're<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.000> gonna<00:00:12.120> give<00:00:12.300> them<00:00:12.360> self

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it we're not gonna give them self

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.160 
it we're not gonna give them self
altered<00:00:13.440> inversions<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.700> truthfully

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
altered inversions because truthfully

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.330 
altered inversions because truthfully
we're<00:00:16.170> gonna<00:00:16.260> want<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> keep<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> continuity

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
we're gonna want to keep the continuity

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
we're gonna want to keep the continuity
of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.970> arpeggio<00:00:21.410> and<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.740> nothing<00:00:23.039> in

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
of the arpeggio and there is nothing in

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.009 
of the arpeggio and there is nothing in
between<00:00:23.160> those<00:00:23.550> three<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.810> going

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019

to do hybrids or mixtures of two

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.599 
to do hybrids or mixtures of two
together<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.859> call<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> different<00:00:29.279> chord

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609

gonna be able to do this easily after

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.320 
gonna be able to do this easily after
practicing<00:03:21.910> we're<00:03:22.000> gonna<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.240> other

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
practicing we're gonna have other

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.060 
practicing we're gonna have other
exercises<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.410> will<00:03:23.470> help<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.800> do<00:03:23.920> this

exercises that will help you to do this
more<00:03:24.250> carefully<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.030> we're<00:03:25.180> gonna<00:03:25.270> also<00:03:26.140> learn

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
more carefully so we're gonna also learn

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.170 
more carefully so we're gonna also learn
progressions<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.670> fingerboard<00:03:27.910> so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
progressions of the fingerboard so

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.130 
progressions of the fingerboard so
instead<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.450> having<00:03:28.660> up<00:03:28.930> here<00:03:30.990> instead<00:03:31.990> of

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
instead of having up here instead of

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.650 
instead of having up here instead of
looking<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.680> next<00:03:32.890> note<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.240> I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
looking for the next note I can just I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.000 
looking for the next note I can just I
already<00:03:34.930> know<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.260> one<00:03:35.410> four<00:03:35.800> five

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
already know my one four five

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.699 
already know my one four five
progression<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.760> can<00:03:36.940> kind<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.209> hear

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.890 

anywhere<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.739> go<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.670> my<00:03:45.940> my<00:03:46.300> progressions

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
anywhere I go I know my my progressions

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.330 
anywhere I go I know my my progressions
as<00:03:47.050> well<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.470> we're<00:03:47.560> gonna<00:03:47.650> learn<00:03:47.800> those<00:03:48.040> too

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
as well and we're gonna learn those too

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.940 
as well and we're gonna learn those too
all<00:03:48.760> right
