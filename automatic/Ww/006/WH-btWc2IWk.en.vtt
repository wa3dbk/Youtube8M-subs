place so one of the funny things about a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
place so one of the funny things about a
Lego<00:01:06.869> system<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.070> combined

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
Lego system is that it can be combined

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.980 
Lego system is that it can be combined
in<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:09.060> ways<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.659> never

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in all different ways that you never

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.770 
in all different ways that you never
really<00:01:10.229> thought<00:01:10.590> were<00:01:10.890> possible<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really thought were possible that's the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.179 
really thought were possible that's the
way<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> elements<00:01:13.409> worth<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.040> at

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
way the elements worth with all them at

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640 
way the elements worth with all them at
work<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> mathematical<00:01:16.200> different

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
work with all the mathematical different

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
work with all the mathematical different
principles<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.180> fit<00:01:18.600> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
principles in them and so they fit in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.179 
principles in them and so they fit in
different<00:01:19.170> places<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.770> you'd<00:01:19.890> never<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
different places that you'd never think

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
different places that you'd never think
they<00:01:20.490> would<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.659> bucket<00:01:22.080> handle<00:01:22.439> happens<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they would this bucket handle happens to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
they would this bucket handle happens to
fit<00:01:23.430> directly<00:01:25.189> inside<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.520> 1<00:01:26.850> by<00:01:27.030> 2<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.930> just

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
fit directly inside a 1 by 2 you just

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
fit directly inside a 1 by 2 you just
put<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
put it in there and then it's got the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
put it in there and then it's got the
little<00:01:30.869> part<00:01:31.350> bulging<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.570> now<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
little part bulging out here now the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
little part bulging out here now the
cool<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> put

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
cool thing about that is when you put

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.280 
cool thing about that is when you put
this<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:37.520> snaps<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.820> place

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
this on here it snaps right into place

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.980 
this on here it snaps right into place
shazam<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.329> double-sided<00:01:42.329> LEGO

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
shazam you have a double-sided LEGO

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
shazam you have a double-sided LEGO
brick<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:44.070> let<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.280> show<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
brick now let me show you the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
brick now let me show you the
capabilities<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
capabilities of that you would have a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760 
capabilities of that you would have a
minifigure<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.439> then<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.619> could

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
minifigure here and then you could

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.249 
minifigure here and then you could
directly<00:01:50.189> start<00:01:50.520> building<00:01:51.210> upside<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.810> with

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
directly start building upside down with
