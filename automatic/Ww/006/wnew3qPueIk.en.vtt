yellow card here for Staniford it is

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.670 
yellow card here for Staniford it is
indeed<00:04:31.890> two<00:04:32.220> minutes<00:04:32.520> off<00:04:33.170> well<00:04:34.170> she<00:04:34.470> had

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
indeed two minutes off well she had

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.650 
indeed two minutes off well she had
perhaps<00:04:34.920> almost<00:04:35.490> no<00:04:35.730> option<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.390> way<00:04:36.600> but

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
perhaps almost no option in a way but

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.070 
perhaps almost no option in a way but
it's<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.070> quite<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.610> penalty<00:04:39.120> two

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
it's a it's a quite a penalty two

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.540 
it's a it's a quite a penalty two
minutes<00:04:40.380> doesn't<00:04:40.560> sound<00:04:40.860> long<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
minutes doesn't sound long but in the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.820 
minutes doesn't sound long but in the
seventh<00:04:41.880> game<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.390> can<00:04:42.600> be<00:04:42.750> an<00:04:42.840> eternity<00:04:42.960> so

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
seventh game it can be an eternity so

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.890 
seventh game it can be an eternity so
seven<00:04:44.250> against<00:04:44.490> six<00:04:44.820> they<00:04:45.240> surely<00:04:45.540> have<00:04:45.780> an

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
seven against six they surely have an

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.410 
seven against six they surely have an
overlap<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.320> gerald<00:04:46.890> village<00:04:47.190> scores<00:04:47.550> and

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
overlap here gerald village scores and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.280 
overlap here gerald village scores and
they're<00:04:49.230> back<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:50.340> second

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.800 

so<00:04:54.290> it's<00:04:54.530> seven<00:04:54.949> apiece<00:04:55.220> with<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.300> conversion

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
so it's seven apiece with the conversion

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.510 
so it's seven apiece with the conversion
successful<00:04:57.470> we've<00:04:57.620> got<00:04:57.800> one<00:04:57.979> minute<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.250> play

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520

of<00:04:58.669> this<00:04:58.790> first<00:04:59.060> half<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.479> what<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> pace<00:04:59.960> this

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
of this first half of what a pace this

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.560 
guested well they're putting good into
position<00:05:10.070> but<00:05:10.250> England<00:05:10.940> haven't<00:05:11.330> benefited

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
position but England haven't benefited

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.719 
position but England haven't benefited
from<00:05:11.990> that<00:05:12.080> because<00:05:12.410> they<00:05:12.680> have<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.889> phone

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729
