 efe 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.640
 hello good kids and we are here with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 a new video and good is in study in 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.340
 domain and nothing I go with the cap 40 that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 I was trying so to see if something came out 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.140
 I carry it with a silencer and the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.060
 big charger there as you see from 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.710
 long distances is pretty fucked up 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 kill with this weapon because it moves 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.890
 very much they have a lot of cadence but it is 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 what precision when shooting 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.580
 if it is a bit far away, it goes towards 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.949
 clouds then it was not a streak like that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 pretty pretty and I wanted to upload it and that's 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.239
 especially on the map this new in 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.269
 study that the nuclear one already fell the other 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.820
 day but good is also is 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.650
 complicated to draw on this map 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.140
 because I've been playing these too 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.729
 days and that and being so small you have to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 be very careful where we 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.800
 we move why is that not 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 we can not be there controlling the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.190
 three flags are there close together 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.440
 of others especially b &amp; c they are a 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.390
 next to each other and he responds to how 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
 you see this part is pretty good here 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.050
 I made the mess to him as you see I do not know 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.860
 how I saved myself because I was there 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.770
 Red 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 but well I was saved yet and nothing has 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.660
 sat clouds that I got to throw it and the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.300
 I had everyone here is this response is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.190
 a little bit fucked up because they come in 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.830
 there to the house of this one in two and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.149
 Well, it's quite complicated but good 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.770
 here he was asking them well and nothing 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.649
 finished if the first round here I 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.380
 I was without ammunition I did not know what to do 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.440
 climbed up the bag is risking a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.330
 little because they were coming out there 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.670
 but is that with this gun because the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.410
 ammo flies right away it ends 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.539
 very fast and good we have to go 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.880
 catching all the backpacks of 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.729
 carrion what we see out there because it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 apart from that there are very few bullets left 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.490
 the bags these when with this weapon 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.000
 well there I ended up with a double 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 with the c4, well, it's going pretty well, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.810
 easier because only to guns 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.170
 stunners we could also go but 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.790
 almost that I prefer the four for so 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.970
 when you are a bit rushed, 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.550
 loose and well there are many times that you 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.980
 fuck for trusting you with the c4 has 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.110
 passed many times that you see with him 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.489
 as in the sad v for example you see that 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 is about to come and he releases 64 and 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.250
 Well, they wear this vest and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.340
 you think you are going to die is the loose 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.560
 adif or confident and if you see that no no what 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.750
 kills and maybe because I often will 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 loose four ago I do not blow it and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.620
 I start to load because I think that already in 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.900
 The moment you are downloading see 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.319
 that you did not kill him and you get hit by the streak 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.500
 it has not happened enough times and nothing here 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.080
 as you see, I tried to always skirt 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.970
 the map because I did not want to get in there 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.459
 he answers full because I had left 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.860
 few and it's worth that for when 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.640
 you go asia for nuclear try 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.260
 always be a little further away from the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 flag that they have is not worth it 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.950
 get so full because I already like 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.410
 we are few because it did not save me 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.300
 vest less bad when few are missing 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.970
 Well, it's worth going catching the little ones 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.820
 little they come they do not go to us 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.950
 for them because when we are here 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.810
 example in nothing I got quite and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.700
 over with this weapon that from far to the no 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.280
 take the reach is quite complicated 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.070
 but good is that if we do not risk 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.110
 it's not funny either, the game has to be 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.100
 risk from time to time but good 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.900
 so to take a nuclear with a 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.670
 weapon of these rare as it is worth 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.100
 ensure at least the latest casualties 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.010
 especially if we have time that still 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.720
 it is pretty much split ahead but 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.570
 well I got two hit me 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.760
 I expected and good the typical thing that there will be 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.709
 happened sometimes that you get two of 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.470
 hit you load the first and good the 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.330
 second already says is because it came that 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.239
 bad for me and I said well 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.610
 I hope cargo I hope it ends 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.650
 the ammunition and I already charge it and good 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.380
 the charger has expanded and still fucked me 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.620
 Oh and I hope you liked it and up 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.620
 the next
