felt more like a filler episode however
it<00:04:44.780> does<00:04:45.050> set<00:04:45.320> up<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.710> unique<00:04:46.310> story<00:04:46.610> line<00:04:46.970> that

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
it does set up a unique story line that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.719 
it does set up a unique story line that
should<00:04:48.110> be<00:04:48.260> extremely<00:04:48.860> interesting<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.550> see

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
should be extremely interesting to see

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.990 
should be extremely interesting to see
what<00:04:49.880> happens<00:04:51.250> although<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.460> setup<00:04:52.849> is

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
what happens although the setup is

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.540 
what happens although the setup is
pretty<00:04:53.150> good

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
pretty good

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.210 
pretty good
good<00:04:54.140> this<00:04:55.140> episode<00:04:55.500> does<00:04:55.680> not<00:04:55.860> seem<00:04:56.100> as

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
good this episode does not seem as

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
good this episode does not seem as
polished<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.880> other<00:04:57.000> ones<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:58.020> puzzles

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
polished as the other ones the puzzles

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.300 
polished as the other ones the puzzles
are<00:04:58.530> very<00:04:58.800> simple<00:04:59.340> they're<00:04:59.790> very<00:05:00.060> scarce<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
are very simple they're very scarce and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.220 
are very simple they're very scarce and
most<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.580> episode<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:03.180> just<00:05:03.600> figuring<00:05:04.110> out

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
most of the episode is just figuring out

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.490 
most of the episode is just figuring out
story<00:05:04.680> which<00:05:05.490> isn't<00:05:05.820> bad<00:05:05.850> but<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.900> seriously

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
story which isn't bad but it seriously

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.380 
story which isn't bad but it seriously
makes<00:05:07.860> this<00:05:08.400> feel<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.880> like<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.030> filler

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
makes this feel just like a filler

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.290 
makes this feel just like a filler
episode<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.830> could<00:05:11.010> also<00:05:11.190> be<00:05:11.340> because<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
episode it could also be because the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.720 
episode it could also be because the
storyline<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.170> different<00:05:13.730> immediately

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
storyline is so different immediately

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.310 
storyline is so different immediately
your<00:05:15.000> first<00:05:15.210> reaction<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.900> just<00:05:16.050> go<00:05:16.200> ahead

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
your first reaction is to just go ahead

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.710 
your first reaction is to just go ahead
and<00:05:16.440> talk<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.920> everybody<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.550> then<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.480> kind

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and talk to everybody and then you kind

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.300 
and talk to everybody and then you kind
of<00:05:18.810> have<00:05:19.080> all<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.650> information<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.280> need

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
of have all the information you need

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.760 
of have all the information you need
right<00:05:21.060> away<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.780> go<00:05:21.930> ahead<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.230> solve<00:05:22.440> all<00:05:22.650> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
right away to go ahead and solve all the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.100 
right away to go ahead and solve all the
puzzles<00:05:22.950> so<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:24.000> does<00:05:24.210> make<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.600> seem<00:05:24.810> very

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
puzzles so it does make it seem very

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.590 
puzzles so it does make it seem very
very<00:05:25.200> easy<00:05:25.860> especially<00:05:26.520> compared<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.450> the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
very easy especially compared to the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.450 
very easy especially compared to the
other<00:05:27.750> episodes<00:05:28.320> where<00:05:28.650> some<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.100> puzzle

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
other episodes where some of the puzzle

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.420 
other episodes where some of the puzzle
solving<00:05:29.850> was<00:05:30.300> more<00:05:30.750> intricate<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.440> harder<00:05:32.220> to

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
solving was more intricate and harder to

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.300 
solving was more intricate and harder to
go<00:05:32.640> back<00:05:32.940> over<00:05:33.410> all<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.560> games<00:05:34.770> still<00:05:35.010> pretty

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
go back over all the games still pretty

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.180 
go back over all the games still pretty
good<00:05:35.730> but<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.870> really<00:05:37.140> builds<00:05:37.620> up<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.920> next

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
good but it really builds up the next

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.950 
good but it really builds up the next
episode<00:05:38.700> more<00:05:38.970> than<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.240> does<00:05:39.450> make<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.690> enjoy

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
episode more than it does make you enjoy

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.850 
episode more than it does make you enjoy
this<00:05:40.410> one<00:05:41.300> I'd<00:05:42.300> still<00:05:42.750> recommend<00:05:42.930> playing<00:05:43.560> it

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
this one I'd still recommend playing it

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.830 
this one I'd still recommend playing it
especially<00:05:44.340> since<00:05:44.550> episode<00:05:44.910> 4<00:05:45.450> looks<00:05:45.690> like

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
especially since episode 4 looks like

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.170 
especially since episode 4 looks like
it's<00:05:45.990> going<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.290> be<00:05:46.410> really<00:05:46.950> good<00:05:47.180> hopefully

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
it's going to be really good hopefully

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.720 
it's going to be really good hopefully
telltale<00:05:48.630> learns<00:05:49.140> that<00:05:49.590> instead<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.460> just

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
telltale learns that instead of just

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.820 
telltale learns that instead of just
pushing<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.420> next<00:05:52.050> episode<00:05:52.470> they<00:05:52.650> should

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
pushing the next episode they should

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.920 
pushing the next episode they should
really<00:05:53.100> fully<00:05:53.640> flesh<00:05:53.970> out<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.420> current<00:05:54.780> one

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
really fully flesh out the current one

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.590 
really fully flesh out the current one
episodes<00:05:55.830> one<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.130> two<00:05:56.490> both<00:05:56.850> did<00:05:57.150> this<00:05:57.300> very

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
episodes one and two both did this very

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.620 
episodes one and two both did this very
well<00:05:57.930> hopefully<00:05:58.680> episodes<00:05:59.580> 4<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.000> 5<00:06:00.210> do<00:06:00.480> the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
well hopefully episodes 4 and 5 do the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.900 
well hopefully episodes 4 and 5 do the
same<00:06:00.870> as<00:06:01.110> of<00:06:01.740> right<00:06:01.890> now<00:06:01.920> this<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.430> easily<00:06:02.730> the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
same as of right now this is easily the

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.600 
same as of right now this is easily the
weakest<00:06:03.600> episode<00:06:04.140> of<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.680> game<00:06:05.870> Martin<00:06:06.870> McFly
