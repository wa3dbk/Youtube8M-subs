00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay well we've got here is I have a box

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.829 
okay well we've got here is I have a box
of<00:00:03.689> 25<00:00:04.110> used<00:00:05.069> hard<00:00:05.430> drives<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.910> I've<00:00:06.540> been

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
of 25 used hard drives that I've been

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.860 
of 25 used hard drives that I've been
tasked<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.290> destroying<00:00:07.560> for<00:00:08.160> my<00:00:08.280> work<00:00:08.870> so

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
tasked with destroying for my work so

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.680 
tasked with destroying for my work so
this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.019> an<00:00:10.230> experiment<00:00:10.830> we've<00:00:11.010> stacked<00:00:11.690> one

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
this is an experiment we've stacked one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.259 
this is an experiment we've stacked one
two<00:00:12.960> three<00:00:13.410> four<00:00:13.769> five<00:00:13.980> six<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.549> stacked<00:00:14.820> six

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
two three four five six we stacked six

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.640 
two three four five six we stacked six
of<00:00:15.480> these<00:00:15.710> 20<00:00:16.710> gigabyte<00:00:17.160> IBM<00:00:17.730> Death<00:00:18.060> Star's

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
of these 20 gigabyte IBM Death Star's

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
of these 20 gigabyte IBM Death Star's
which<00:00:20.240> I've<00:00:21.240> spent<00:00:21.570> their<00:00:21.689> whole<00:00:21.840> life

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
which I've spent their whole life

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.359 
which I've spent their whole life
sucking<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.890> screwing<00:00:23.519> me<00:00:23.699> over<00:00:23.970> at<00:00:24.029> work<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
sucking and screwing me over at work and

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.929 
sucking and screwing me over at work and
I<00:00:26.570> think<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> 24<00:00:28.439> computers<00:00:28.980> probably

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I think out of 24 computers probably

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540 
I think out of 24 computers probably
over<00:00:30.449> half<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:31.009> have<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.430> been

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
over half of them have had to have been

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.709 
over half of them have had to have been
replaced<00:00:32.960> these<00:00:33.960> ones<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.680> work<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.719> I'm

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
replaced these ones actually work so I'm

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.819 
replaced these ones actually work so I'm
going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> old<00:00:37.460> 12<00:00:38.460> ton<00:00:38.850> press<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:40.649> see

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
going to use the old 12 ton press to see

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
going to use the old 12 ton press to see
what<00:00:40.980> kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> damage<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.969> inflict<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what kind of damage we can inflict on

00:00:42.570 --> 00:01:27.460 
what kind of damage we can inflict on
these<00:01:24.770> you're<00:01:25.770> selling<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.400> destroyed

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
these you're selling to get destroyed

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:37.429 
these you're selling to get destroyed
one<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.770> another<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:36.350> okay<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> think

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
one way or another right okay I think

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:54.500 
one way or another right okay I think
that's<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:37.890> enough

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.620 

 sure<00:01:55.750> sounds<00:01:56.110> broken<00:01:56.470> oh<00:01:58.540> are

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
 sure sounds broken oh are

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.170 
 sure sounds broken oh are
these<00:01:58.750> glass<00:01:59.050> Potter<00:01:59.380> drives<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:00.100> guess<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
these glass Potter drives I guess the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:12.240 
these glass Potter drives I guess the
IBM<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:01.660> our<00:02:01.810> glass<00:02:09.300> good<00:02:10.980> well<00:02:11.980> that's<00:02:12.130> why

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
IBM is our glass good well that's why

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.140 
IBM is our glass good well that's why
God<00:02:12.459> made<00:02:12.490> vacuums

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.970 

okay<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.209> IBM<00:02:16.959> Death<00:02:17.200> Star's<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.560> easy<00:02:17.800> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
okay so IBM Death Star's are easy to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.770 
okay so IBM Death Star's are easy to
destroy<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> hold<00:02:19.390> this

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
destroy can you hold this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.620 
destroy can you hold this
yeah<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.860> Drive<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.330> previously<00:02:22.330> took<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
yeah this Drive I previously took the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.150 
yeah this Drive I previously took the
screws<00:02:22.900> out<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> top<00:02:23.739> there<00:02:23.980> oh<00:02:24.280> yeah<00:02:25.060> oh

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
screws out of the top there oh yeah oh

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.750 
screws out of the top there oh yeah oh
my<00:02:27.160> god<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:29.160> thought<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.580> mobile

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
my god I thought it was just for mobile

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.710 
my god I thought it was just for mobile
drives<00:02:31.270> but<00:02:31.570> apparently<00:02:31.870> hold<00:02:32.200> your<00:02:32.380> desktop

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
drives but apparently hold your desktop

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.010 
drives but apparently hold your desktop
like<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:36.000> huh<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.780> could<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:37.930> just

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
like that huh so I could have just

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.330 
like that huh so I could have just
hurled<00:02:38.350> each<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.739> these<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> ground

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
hurled each one of these to the ground

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:56.740 
hurled each one of these to the ground
and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.580

it's like I'm nothing maybe it is like a
different<00:04:03.720> knowledge<00:04:04.020> something<00:04:05.420> fires

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
different knowledge something fires

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.230 
different knowledge something fires
still<00:04:06.660> intact<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.319> see<00:04:07.910> that's<00:04:08.910> good<00:04:09.120> just

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.580 
still intact I can see that's good just
broken<00:04:09.569> glass<00:04:09.750> everywhere<00:04:09.990> yeah

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
broken glass everywhere yeah

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.210 
broken glass everywhere yeah
no<00:04:11.130> shoes<00:04:11.370> yep<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.970> course<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:16.769> ones<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.070> can
