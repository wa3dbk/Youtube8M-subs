00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.080
 man has his work in the temple 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.180
 technology that can seriously 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.650
 make life easier for people with disabilities 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.260
 opportunities more today if 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.040
 they will be able to send text messages 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.969
 or use the Internet 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.969
 details at Catherine Popova 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 we are competing 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970
 physicists clarify the idea of ​​the fastest that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 there is in the world 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.699
 one did not decide the human brain 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.710
 the most perfect apparatus of the universe 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.500
 study group has created 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.789
 technology that allows 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.170
 use his thoughts for example what 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.760
 transfer a team without weak or 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.379
 commit certain 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.750
 actions bezrukov and at the same time learn 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.920
 intention man we can kind of snapshots 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 very thin now 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.140
 the reaction is very subtle stimulus contributions 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.560
 why try technology yourself for 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.820
 this need to concentrate 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150
 my thoughts will not be easy for a person 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.280
 soars in the clouds 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.210
 electric light electrode attack 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.850
 brain cell impulse a person should 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 hard to think in what language he thinks 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.910
 then yes it doesn’t matter because 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 nothing is all about everything that AvtoVAZ 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.500
 intends to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 largely formed in some kind of his 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.910
 deep deep language by the way see 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.030
 and read the authorities as such scientists 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.090
 can not be afraid 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.950
 technology captures only reactions to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.570
 irritants for example if a person 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 will not think much but literally 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.460
 the screen of the monitor, he can type the snow leopard 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.470
 help hands 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.620
 I think of one of the pieces of images 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.410
 if i can concentrate 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.550
 on the right square he will come running next 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.140
 fields 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.440
 look exactly 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.250
 but that said that military secrets 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 by the way this program allows 1 3 not 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.579
 taken away and memory 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.630
 developers call it britney 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.310
 plus technology is also possible 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.669
 use computer games 

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:43.409
 so it can be beaten 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.189
 the enemy is at the next computer 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.710
 one of them therefore in full swing 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.900
 if you put a number of two people on the wallpaper 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
 there is a waste when it's all the same 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.060
 will show the mass of each separately 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 arsenal does not move 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.159
 if they are like us on each side
