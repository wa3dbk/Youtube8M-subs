hit<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.510> go<00:00:42.590> let's<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:44.750> that's<00:00:45.750> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
hit here we go let's see that's for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:02.290 
hit here we go let's see that's for
sonic<00:00:46.289> device<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:47.129> here

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:17.390 

okay<00:01:04.640> what<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> hell<00:01:06.090> happened<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:16.370> get<00:01:17.370> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
okay what the hell happened here get a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.370 
okay what the hell happened here get a
sample<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.180> determine<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.750> way<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:18.960> no

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.990 

and<00:01:22.380> while<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.740> at<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> collect<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.820> sample

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and while you're at it collect a sample

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.170 
and while you're at it collect a sample
of<00:01:24.240> those<00:01:24.390> weird<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.960> metal<00:01:25.170> Reese's

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.280 

receiving<00:01:30.180> sample<00:01:30.510> data<00:01:30.690> from<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.020> field

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

kit<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.680> let's<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:33.119> type<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.660> ap-<00:01:34.170> which

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
kit now let's say what type is ap- which

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
kit now let's say what type is ap- which
is<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> same<00:01:35.160> as<00:01:35.369> reach<00:01:35.520> Mars<00:01:35.880> less<00:01:36.869> than<00:01:37.050> 1

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is the same as reach Mars less than 1

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.930 
is the same as reach Mars less than 1
percent<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.619> adults<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.340> time<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.910> I

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
percent of adults have this time so I

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.880 
percent of adults have this time so I
would<00:01:39.330> say<00:01:39.510> we<00:01:39.660> have<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> match<00:01:40.080> all<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.770> now

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
would say we have a match all right now

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.170 
would say we have a match all right now
let's<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.280> look<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.520> those<00:01:41.610> metal<00:01:41.970> pieces
