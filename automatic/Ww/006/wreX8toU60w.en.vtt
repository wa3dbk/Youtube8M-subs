simulate the hills of Italy Oh with the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.330 
simulate the hills of Italy Oh with the
BRIT<00:01:05.820> breezes<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> drafts<00:01:07.220> would<00:01:08.220> have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
BRIT breezes and the drafts would have

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.180 
BRIT breezes and the drafts would have
found<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.180> found<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> work<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.770> period<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
found I found this work good period of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.260 
found I found this work good period of
time<00:01:11.570> now<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.780> hoping<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.670> holes<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
time now we're hoping get this holes and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
time now we're hoping get this holes and
I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.660> was<00:01:15.810> that'll<00:01:16.050> fall<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.440> like

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I think it was that'll fall just like

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.720 
I think it was that'll fall just like
that<00:01:16.800> without<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:20.340> reasonable<00:01:21.270> hang<00:01:21.510> like<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
that without a reasonable hang like this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.410 
that without a reasonable hang like this
