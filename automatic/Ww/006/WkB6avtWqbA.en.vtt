00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
deal yeah exactly

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.870 
deal yeah exactly
some<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.259> might<00:02:04.380> only<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:04.950> it's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
some people might only think it's it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
some people might only think it's it's
not<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.119> great<00:02:06.360> opportunity<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
not a great opportunity but for me it is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919 
not a great opportunity but for me it is
obviously<00:02:08.849> I've<00:02:09.000> been<00:02:09.030> injured<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.660> quite<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
obviously I've been injured for quite a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.290 
obviously I've been injured for quite a
while

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
while

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.760 
while
it<00:02:11.390> didn't<00:02:11.600> work<00:02:11.720> out<00:02:11.900> with<00:02:12.050> Northampton<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it didn't work out with Northampton and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.410 
it didn't work out with Northampton and
I<00:02:13.010> think<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> great<00:02:13.640> opportunity<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.210> me

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I think it's a great opportunity for me

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.040 
I think it's a great opportunity for me
to<00:02:14.450> come<00:02:15.340> prove<00:02:16.340> myself<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.030> try<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.870> fit

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
to come prove myself and try and get fit

then take it into Saturday's so Saturday

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.360

their<00:03:31.970> weaknesses<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.720> their<00:03:33.290> strengths<00:03:33.620> so

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
their weaknesses and their strengths so

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.760 
their weaknesses and their strengths so
you<00:03:33.890> have<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:35.060> tell<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.300> gaffer<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:35.810> um<00:03:35.959> yeah

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
you have to tell the gaffer but um yeah

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.199 
you have to tell the gaffer but um yeah
it's<00:03:36.950> obviously<00:03:37.220> gonna<00:03:37.400> be<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> good<00:03:37.760> game<00:03:37.970> and

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
it's obviously gonna be a good game and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.180 
it's obviously gonna be a good game and
make<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.750> good<00:03:38.959> squad<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.350> be<00:03:39.380> fair<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.950> I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
make it a good squad to be fair so I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.120 
make it a good squad to be fair so I
think<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.970> will<00:03:41.090> be<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.270> tough<00:03:41.510> game<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:42.130> being

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
think it will be a tough game but being

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.310 
think it will be a tough game but being
there<00:03:43.280> last<00:03:43.489> season<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:44.090> think<00:03:44.180> our<00:03:44.900> scores

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
there last season I think our scores

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.410 
there last season I think our scores
just<00:03:45.590> as<00:03:45.830> good<00:03:46.040> or<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.520> lot<00:03:46.970> better<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.330> be

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
just as good or a lot better to be

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.720 
just as good or a lot better to be
honest<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:48.410> coming<00:03:48.709> here<00:03:48.920> there<00:03:49.459> was<00:03:49.610> some
