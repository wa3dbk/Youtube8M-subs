00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.180
 Welcome to Phoenix World too 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.850
 an edition of sb 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.500
 next to stuff like chips or philips 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 or salt bars or other 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 I'm a very big snack 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.450
 fan of popcorn if not now in the evening 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.430
 for example in the movie coco or something and 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.070
 Popcorn is always the problem 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.199
 I'll do that if I have this 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.730
 Finished parts buy the microwave does that 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.320
 Mostly it does not taste that way at least to me 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.530
 not so there are some from schiro 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.120
 from biochips of she we have as 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 popcorn things are brought out that are whole 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.930
 okay but it's not like me 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.670
 Actually imagine that I do it 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.990
 mostly so that i will be normal then 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.729
 mostly dried the market for it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.890
 Can take in a pot 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.360
 clean with a little oil and lid 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.229
 then the poco need that just simply 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.270
 then you can come yourself 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.030
 you want to know how to make salty that way 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.920
 I like that sweet caramel 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.780
 or what ever 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.790
 and I found something now 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.920
 we're in for something again 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.600
 then brand new is on top of that one 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 I would mix popcorn and chips 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.520
 say because it is also from ski and 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.579
 Although it is today from the popcorn 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.090
 popcorn triangles flair 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.070
 suite so sweet there was no 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.180
 otherwise I would be salty or sheep 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.640
 or something else brought along but 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.780
 to test 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 logically also new on it are 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 that's definitely the test 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.119
 all right and it's something I know 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.439
 bought and found myself again 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.149
 and do not send it off anymore or 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.030
 miro that not sent by anyone 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.550
 make popcorn the new art 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.020
 to enjoy popcorn 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.720
 Sun has so triangles reminiscent in design 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.590
 me a little bit so potato rÃ¶sti 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.590
 I really knew tried 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.770
 okay I was different 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.060
 presented but good as I had 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.430
 they thought they were a bit thicker 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 but they are actually as chic 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.330
 look a bit like tortilla 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.830
 chips to see it here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.880
 but it's just popcorn in sweet that 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.170
 actually smells good 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.790
 If I think something now I think so 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.020
 always try the ten tips 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.020
 I would say the problems whole series 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.430
 8th 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.960
 the good ones 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.790
 that tastes good that copter that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 she is totally unfamiliar because you expect 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.550
 Here's a best he's damaging 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.730
 or what nacho-like but this 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.730
 chips all-in 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's exactly what I was looking for but it is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 actually popko in the form of animal welfare 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.540
 reminds me very much of this rice 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.250
 cracker knows the particular raisting 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.710
 There's also chocolate with it all 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.490
 normal nature moderately sweet and salty, too 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.470
 always there is really slow 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.300
 and gently through the miles to leckerli 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.330
 fly and crispy triangles 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.870
 I would be interested in jacked up 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.790
 So the make the right consistency 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.250
 I do not have to say it like popcorn resin 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:08.290
 many exotics were not baked on it 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.580
 fried but I can not find it now 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.590
 bad if it still early 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.290
 Taste would be like sweet 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.670
 how cute salty or something like that would be me 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.530
 definitely try it 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.850
 but it's not bad me 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.130
 had it worse 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.580
 but really what has to do with popcorn 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.580
 not any longer longer 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.789
 Great 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.539
 So you do not have to buy 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.639
 I do not hear that saying so far 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.080
 bad but otherwise special then 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.300
 dear pop can do it yourself in one 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.710
 pot I just explained that and then 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.360
 nice salt on it or something I think so 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.069
 a lot better a little bit better 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.120
 Greasier when I eat a popcorn 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.520
 be finished 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.789
 above all, this is always me 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.039
 honestly baked not fried 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.289
 less fat now who itches then eat 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.090
 I do not have chips so of course if you do 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.289
 Anyway, if the diet wants to do that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.550
 but have a few chips then that is 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.819
 Maybe okay, but if I think so 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.409
 buy or something of this kind here then 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.630
 may then be quiet well fed in there 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.889
 and sugar and no idea when is this 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.139
 yes, not every day or fed 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.789
 not only what he does not want he was 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.280
 again 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.130
 That's why I would popcorn this figure 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.569
 as I would not necessarily do it now 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.610
 Buy again at least not in 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.129
 tastes sweet 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.509
 well as much more I have you times 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.069
 you try him himself times 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.380
 out and write me in the comments 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.120
 what you think about it as always and before 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.210
 Everything in the comments you like 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.099
 euro popcorn is because I know that 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.409
 my wife used to just sweet popcorn 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.029
 has eaten and since she knows me 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.190
 if you only eat salt, it is not 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.779
 sweet popcorn more writes me that 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.449
 comments what your opinion on popcorn 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.740
 and that popcorn it here and would 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.219
 let's say it's me next time 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.219
 I am out
