00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
machine to swing tube machines so it is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
machine to swing tube machines so it is
capable<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> taking<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:21.900> quarter

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.569 
inch aggregate and shortly I'll show you
the<00:00:29.550> operation<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.710> too<00:00:31.980> bad<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.369> far<00:00:32.430> as

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the operation it's not too bad as far as

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.840 
the operation it's not too bad as far as
being<00:00:32.850> relatively<00:00:33.390> clean<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.579> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> age

this is the forward and reverse valve
again<00:01:22.400> everything<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.390> pump<00:01:23.660> is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
again everything on this pump is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.190 
again everything on this pump is
entirely<00:01:24.350> mechanical<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.630> nothing<00:01:27.110> to

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
entirely mechanical so nothing to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.270 
entirely mechanical so nothing to
replace<00:01:27.440> electronic<00:01:29.890> there's<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.920> forward<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280
