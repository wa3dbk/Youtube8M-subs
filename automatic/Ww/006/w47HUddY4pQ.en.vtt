00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.959
 a way to achieve good responsiveness from 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.239
 children 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.699
 this is setting up a connection with them you can 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:19.099
 condescend to their level shake his hand 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.289
 if they want to lily tell them hold 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.300
 five introduce myself ask how much to them 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.179
 years in general to start chatting with them 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.249
 heart to heart in my opinion the best way 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.119
 capture them active first do 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.649
 family snapshot 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.320
 where everything is in the frame and everyone is looking at the camera 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.109
 then let the children play and when 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.899
 they will start spinning around 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.850
 will reveal their own hiv character 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.010
 getting interesting pictures of children 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.289
 capturing various fun moments 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.329
 speech chickpea light and composition maybe 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.550
 even just lie on the ground go down on 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.890
 baby level and take off bottom is possible 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 adding leaves or flowers or something in 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.789
 this kind of thing in the foreground to something 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.949
 hit the frame in the foreground a 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.839
 then focus on the background 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.550
 it will give you a nice shape if you 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.200
 have to take pictures on congenital 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.090
 difficulties may arise because 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.250
 they don't frame anything so 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.290
 best will be photographing them 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 moment of sleep using macro 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.210
 lens will allow you to do close-ups 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.860
 arms and legs and be ready for 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.230
 unobtrusive things that are not 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.810
 you might not expect it 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.490
 but it can happen that he will even yawn 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 if according to parents it will be 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.270
 look funny you still make 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.860
 some great shots even if 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.840
 in some places and some shots 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 get an excellent majority 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.390
 cases, parents like shots where they are 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.400
 the children are smiling this is easily achieved but 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.870
 sometimes it is better to reveal the nature of the child and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.580
 get enough expressing 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.470
 mood frames those moments when 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.240
 the child may have displeased you 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.670
 I remember shooting once 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.170
 the five year old took some pictures 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.190
 one was opposite the coffee house where the baby 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.840
 rested pretended you didn't take us down 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.270
 these moments are important to keep clicking 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.490
 and when her mom was reviewing the shooting 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 she chose exactly that said that 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.240
 strong enough and pushy it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.650
 always a nice compliment when 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.149
 parents say that you managed 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 capture the child's identity 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.290
 equipment that is required for 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.780
 shooting children when one is enough 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.030
 carcasses and maybe one or two lenses 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.510
 i'm mean because i love 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.120
 its iron 85 f 1 and 2 my favorite 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.489
 The lens is heavy enough glass and 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.879
 it's great when you take off for an open 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.189
 with f12, I always focus on my eyes and 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.810
 everything else is blurred it 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.640
 it may be a little difficult when 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 taking off your children and maybe you have to 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.060
 do not increase the shutter speed 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.829
 get this lens until you 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.819
 make contact with the child so that he 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.340
 spun less 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.670
 one of my favorite lenses is 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.280
 70200 with 28 glass of excellent quality 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.629
 when using a reflector with him I want 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.980
 note that when using 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.599
 quick fix I can 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.189
 to quickly deal with shooting 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.950
 landscapes with a shift in exposure 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.859
 tripod here is another small 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.560
 secret weapon 24 70 f 2 and 8 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.749
 great lens he really 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.299
 good is sharp and wonderful and having applied 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:10.700
 most shooting situations I can 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.519
 start shooting at 24 millimeters 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.530
 covering the whole scene and then under run down 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.840
 on children's faces 1635 f2 and 8 another 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.879
 a good versatile lens is what i'm 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.780
 call my 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.549
 wide angle may be applicable for 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.469
 close-up shooting for example 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.090
 children playing in the backyard can 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.920
 crouch down and let them jump 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.389
 sweeps over you after filming 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.519
 the span of children playing can ban 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.959
 information in the foreground in 1 tricks 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 and something in the background this way 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.129
 modify images by focusing 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.950
 different plans I use bushes 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.799
 speedlite 580ex for well tuned 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.200
 flash taking off titi l and you can 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.669
 tune back and twist 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.159
 at -1 and -2 for easing the flash yet 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.469
 one small good product 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.849
 cable it allows you to place well 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:07.730
 from the side moving here and so here and so 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.529
 he and again i play with this not 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.659
 being tied to one place when I 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.310
 check the result behind me like this 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.080
 liked 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.580
 used it one more time but still 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.780
 when you shoot children you need 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.000
 act very quickly 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.739
 what else is convenient to use channel ski 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.330
 flares are something that can be customized 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 as leading and driven 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.370
 and can be used simultaneously up to 5 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.960
 pieces by setting them at will you don't even 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.460
 need a trigger you can 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 use camera starter either 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.480
 use single flash setting on 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.610
 the camera and the other part apart 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.380
 did one thing in leading second known 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.020
 in some cases at home and 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.300
 used as backlight and bad 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.090
 gimmick is setting plus 1 for 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.040
 create fill light another tooth 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.840
 which i use is a reflector 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.260
 reflectors can be used in different 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.500
 qualities like this you get wide 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.780
 reflective layer here and gilded too 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.470
 good and that is really helpful when 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.389
 taking pictures outside is a diffuser which 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.820
 scatters harsh sunlight 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.979
 place it over the child and this 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.570
 here we support reflectors 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.370
 really helpful because 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.590
 let you highlight your eyes 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.630
 indoor shooting can sometimes be 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.610
 difficult but with this range to 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.710
 measurements you can shoot at elevated 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.600
 forests and doing it really bad 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.880
 lighted situations you can shoot 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.340
 on very high iso in any conditions 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.260
 lighting without using flashes 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.300
 moment when people are unaware that you are 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.669
 shoot for example watching kids 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.770
 play hiding behind the door from afar and 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.060
 continue and continue and continue 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.590
 you can also get great 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.930
 pictures just sitting comfortably 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.729
 cameras so you always catch and special 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.919
 my best advice when shooting 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.840
 children will be what if you as a photographer 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.130
 going to shoot where you settle when 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.200
 this enjoy 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.479
 keep in touch with 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.060
 kid tuning in to their morning level 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.070
 and it encourages kids they are so 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.840
 susceptible and responsive to this them 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.910
 nice to play and spend time with you 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.440
 if you really want to boost 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.630
 level of your shots best advice 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.919
 will just do not stop understand 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.300
 if you click the little 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.030
 focus on analyzing the results 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.860
 do not stop shooting 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.270
 understand each time it will turn out 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.270
 better and better and better
