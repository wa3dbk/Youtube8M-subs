00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
there just like you did with the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
for the back here

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.500 
for the back here
the<00:03:30.159> original<00:03:30.519> b-daman<00:03:30.699> did<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.150> come<00:03:31.359> with

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the original b-daman did not come with

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.250 
the original b-daman did not come with
one<00:03:31.659> of<00:03:31.750> these<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.680> just<00:03:32.949> take<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.400> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
one of these so you just take that and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.089 
one of these so you just take that and
it'll<00:03:35.260> cover<00:03:35.949> up<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.400> whole<00:03:36.639> back<00:03:36.819> here<00:03:38.099> which

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
it'll cover up the whole back here which

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.059 
it'll cover up the whole back here which
is<00:03:39.280> kind<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.639> cool<00:03:39.760> i<00:03:40.000> prefer<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.659> off

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
is kind of cool i prefer that off

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.979 
is kind of cool i prefer that off
however<00:03:44.370> here's<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.430> comparison<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
however here's a comparison with the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.819 
however here's a comparison with the
original<00:03:47.849> cobalt<00:03:48.849> blade<00:03:49.209> here<00:03:49.810> again<00:03:50.229> don't

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
original cobalt blade here again don't

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.969 
original cobalt blade here again don't
have<00:03:51.010> any<00:03:51.159> stickers<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.760> him<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.739> still

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
have any stickers on him but you still

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.280 
have any stickers on him but you still
get<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.220> idea<00:03:54.639> a<00:03:54.879> very<00:03:55.269> different<00:03:55.750> look<00:03:55.959> this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
get the idea a very different look this

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.409 
get the idea a very different look this
is<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.620> color<00:03:56.919> change<00:03:57.190> system<00:03:57.699> and<00:03:57.909> this<00:03:58.239> is

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
is the color change system and this is

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.469 
is the color change system and this is
the<00:03:58.569> zero<00:03:58.870> system<00:03:59.970> now<00:04:00.970> let's<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.239> on<00:04:01.329> to

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
the zero system now let's get on to

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:07.469 
the zero system now let's get on to
firing<00:04:02.079> this<00:04:02.560> guy<00:04:04.739> again<00:04:05.739> we'll<00:04:06.699> put<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.299> beat

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
firing this guy again we'll put the beat

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.050 
firing this guy again we'll put the beat
of<00:04:07.599> all<00:04:07.720> in<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.229> is<00:04:08.979> fully<00:04:09.370> compatible<00:04:09.760> with

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
of all in it is fully compatible with

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.599 
of all in it is fully compatible with
the<00:04:10.629> original<00:04:11.470> betta<00:04:12.010> balls<00:04:12.220> which<00:04:12.459> is

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
the original betta balls which is

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.270 
the original betta balls which is
fantastic<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:15.099> first<00:04:15.340> thing<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.840> note<00:04:17.280> when

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
fantastic the first thing to note when

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.680 
fantastic the first thing to note when
firing<00:04:18.639> this<00:04:18.940> is<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.299> it's<00:04:19.419> got<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:19.570> a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
firing this is that it's got this a

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.279 
firing this is that it's got this a
little<00:04:20.010> bit<00:04:21.010> down<00:04:21.370> here<00:04:21.729> affected<00:04:22.300> by<00:04:22.450> gravity

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
little bit down here affected by gravity

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.990 
little bit down here affected by gravity
now<00:04:24.010> when<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.370> fire<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.600 

up<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.230> not<00:04:28.740> touching<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> ground

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
up like this not touching the ground

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.940 
up like this not touching the ground
that<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.030> obviously<00:04:30.390> down<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.260> when<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.710> fire

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
that is obviously down and when you fire

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.100 
that is obviously down and when you fire
that<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:35.490> does<00:04:35.850> fire<00:04:36.300> but<00:04:37.110> it's<00:04:37.230> got<00:04:37.410> no<00:04:37.620> power

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that it does fire but it's got no power

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.660 
that it does fire but it's got no power
when<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.230> bring<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.710> down<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.460> got<00:04:41.580> these

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
when you bring this down it's got these

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.570 
when you bring this down it's got these
two<00:04:41.760> little<00:04:42.290> prongs<00:04:43.290> here<00:04:43.740> now<00:04:44.010> those<00:04:44.280> are<00:04:44.490> on

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
two little prongs here now those are on

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.850 
two little prongs here now those are on
the<00:04:44.700> original<00:04:44.820> beat<00:04:45.810> them<00:04:45.930> on<00:04:46.050> two<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.650> then

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
the original beat them on two and then

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.640 
the original beat them on two and then
it<00:04:47.130> has<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.520> wing<00:04:47.910> pack<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.780> allows<00:04:49.140> power

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
it has this wing pack that allows power

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.320 
it has this wing pack that allows power
because<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.610> squeezes<00:04:51.350> these<00:04:52.640> outward<00:04:56.330> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
because it squeezes these outward it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.240 
because it squeezes these outward it
causes<00:04:57.690> more<00:04:57.810> resistance<00:04:58.380> now<00:04:58.620> this<00:04:58.890> does<00:04:59.070> the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
causes more resistance now this does the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.920 
causes more resistance now this does the
same<00:04:59.280> thing<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.330> got<00:05:00.450> these<00:05:00.570> two<00:05:00.750> little

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
same thing it's got these two little

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.520 
same thing it's got these two little
bits<00:05:01.500> here<00:05:01.950> but<00:05:02.580> instead<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.390> having<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:04.170> wing

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
bits here but instead of having a wing

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.500 
bits here but instead of having a wing
pack<00:05:04.830> or<00:05:05.040> anything<00:05:05.220> when<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.850> press<00:05:06.180> this

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
pack or anything when you press this

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.860 
pack or anything when you press this
down<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:07.560> goes<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.670> between<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.240> two<00:05:09.420> prongs

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
down it goes in between the two prongs

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.620 
down it goes in between the two prongs
and<00:05:10.200> again<00:05:10.710> causes<00:05:11.130> more<00:05:11.280> resistance<00:05:11.820> for

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
and again causes more resistance for

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.140 
and again causes more resistance for
more<00:05:13.080> power<00:05:13.380> now<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.800> big<00:05:14.100> thing<00:05:14.430> about<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
more power now the big thing about the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.270 
more power now the big thing about the
excel<00:05:15.570> core<00:05:15.870> is<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.650> betta<00:05:16.890> ball<00:05:17.070> can

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
excel core is that the betta ball can

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.210 
excel core is that the betta ball can
accelerate<00:05:17.820> over<00:05:18.450> time<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.770> gives<00:05:19.950> a

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
accelerate over time and it gives a

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.090 
accelerate over time and it gives a
front<00:05:20.760> board<00:05:20.970> spin<00:05:21.630> on<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.530> betta<00:05:22.710> ball<00:05:22.919> as

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
front board spin on the betta ball as

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.990 
front board spin on the betta ball as
well<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:24.000> got<00:05:24.150> this<00:05:24.240> big<00:05:24.740> rubber<00:05:25.740> piece<00:05:26.190> down

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
well it's got this big rubber piece down

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.659 
well it's got this big rubber piece down
here<00:05:27.510> at<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.750> bottom<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.340> provides<00:05:29.340> some

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
here at the bottom that provides some

catch the fit grip that's talking about

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.780 
catch the fit grip that's talking about
on<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.090> box<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.540> that<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:34.770> shoulders<00:05:35.280> here

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
for a certain kind of grip here that is

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.210 
for a certain kind of grip here that is
very<00:05:42.900> comfortable<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:45.990> have<00:05:46.229> a<00:05:46.530> battle<00:05:46.979> pin

very comfortable so I have a battle pin

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.650 
very comfortable so I have a battle pin

just press the trigger here now let's
try<00:06:02.040> out<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.729> game<00:06:03.150> we<00:06:03.540> saw<00:06:03.780> on<00:06:04.050> the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
try out that game we saw on the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.750 
try out that game we saw on the
packaging<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:06.300> says<00:06:06.360> here<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:08.490> first

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
packaging it says here that the first

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.890 
packaging it says here that the first
level<00:06:09.120> is<00:06:09.330> adding<00:06:09.690> for<00:06:10.080> betta<00:06:10.350> balls<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:11.370> the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
level is adding for betta balls to the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.730 
level is adding for betta balls to the
bottle<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.470> next<00:06:13.770> level<00:06:14.100> is<00:06:14.450> five<00:06:15.450> and<00:06:15.930> the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
bottle the next level is five and the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.120 
bottle the next level is five and the
next<00:06:17.190> level<00:06:17.400> is<00:06:17.640> eight<00:06:18.030> so<00:06:18.540> blue<00:06:18.840> red<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.620> gold

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
next level is eight so blue red and gold

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:27.770 
next level is eight so blue red and gold
so<00:06:21.169> firstly<00:06:22.370> will<00:06:23.370> add<00:06:25.430> more<00:06:26.430> again<00:06:27.360> this<00:06:27.540> is<00:06:27.750> a

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
so firstly will add more again this is a

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.120 
so firstly will add more again this is a
power<00:06:28.620> test<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.970> excels<00:06:30.840> rezian<00:06:31.380> is<00:06:31.650> power

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
power test and excels rezian is power

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.709 
power test and excels rezian is power
types<00:06:32.640> so<00:06:33.229> we'll<00:06:34.229> see<00:06:34.410> how<00:06:34.560> well<00:06:34.800> this<00:06:35.010> goes<00:06:36.800> so

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
types so we'll see how well this goes so

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:47.409 
types so we'll see how well this goes so
Ready<00:06:39.319> Set<00:06:40.269> B<00:06:41.269> fight<00:06:43.869> and<00:06:45.549> there<00:06:46.549> we<00:06:46.849> go

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
Ready Set B fight and there we go

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.149 
Ready Set B fight and there we go
now<00:06:48.169> also<00:06:49.329> is<00:06:50.329> surprisingly<00:06:51.229> adding<00:06:51.799> one<00:06:52.129> more

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159 
now also is surprisingly adding one more

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.269 
now also is surprisingly adding one more
beatable<00:06:53.139> really<00:06:54.139> does<00:06:54.379> out<00:06:54.619> a<00:06:54.649> world<00:06:54.979> of

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
beatable really does out a world of

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.209 
beatable really does out a world of
difference<00:06:55.729> so<00:06:55.819> this<00:06:56.029> is<00:06:56.179> the<00:06:56.329> red<00:06:56.719> level<00:06:57.559> with

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
difference so this is the red level with

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:05.829 
difference so this is the red level with
five<00:06:58.610> feet<00:06:58.909> of<00:06:59.029> balls<00:06:59.179> here<00:07:04.419> you<00:07:05.419> also<00:07:05.569> saw

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:05.839 
five feet of balls here you also saw

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.899 
five feet of balls here you also saw
there<00:07:06.079> it<00:07:06.259> went<00:07:06.739> back<00:07:06.949> and<00:07:06.979> then<00:07:07.279> went<00:07:07.459> forward

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909 
there it went back and then went forward

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.879 
there it went back and then went forward
that<00:07:08.059> is<00:07:08.269> because<00:07:08.599> of<00:07:08.749> the<00:07:08.839> excel<00:07:11.589> yeah<00:07:12.589> that's

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
that is because of the excel yeah that's

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.239 
that is because of the excel yeah that's
not<00:07:13.189> gonna<00:07:13.369> happen<00:07:13.459> and<00:07:14.409> just<00:07:15.409> for<00:07:15.709> fun<00:07:15.919> I

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:18.249 
not gonna happen and just for fun I

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:20.939 
not gonna happen and just for fun I
guess<00:07:19.249> we'll<00:07:19.550> take<00:07:19.759> a<00:07:19.819> look<00:07:20.089> at<00:07:20.389> eight

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:20.949 
guess we'll take a look at eight

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.489 
guess we'll take a look at eight
beatable<00:07:21.949> I<00:07:22.489> have<00:07:23.089> actually<00:07:23.539> tried<00:07:23.869> this<00:07:24.199> in

00:07:24.489 --> 00:07:24.499 
beatable I have actually tried this in

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:28.769 
beatable I have actually tried this in
better<00:07:24.919> situations<00:07:25.869> my<00:07:26.869> space<00:07:27.409> is<00:07:27.679> kind<00:07:27.919> of

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:28.779 
better situations my space is kind of

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.759 
better situations my space is kind of
hindered<00:07:29.779> because<00:07:29.989> of<00:07:30.289> the<00:07:30.409> filming

hindered because of the filming
situation<00:07:31.459> but<00:07:32.289> eight<00:07:33.289> is<00:07:34.239> rather<00:07:35.239> impossible

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:36.019 
situation but eight is rather impossible

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:41.229
