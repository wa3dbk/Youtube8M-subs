them<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.340> believe<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.360> of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
them now this is I believe the first of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
them now this is I believe the first of
a<00:00:33.960> series<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> street<00:00:35.550> magic<00:00:35.700> one

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
a series because it's a street magic one

a series because it's a street magic one
levitation<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.020> hopefully<00:00:37.829> there'll<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.040> some

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
levitation so hopefully there'll be some

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.810 
levitation so hopefully there'll be some
more<00:00:38.489> different<00:00:39.420> apps<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.430> least<00:00:41.550> for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
more different apps out but at least for

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700 
more different apps out but at least for
this<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> focuses<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> levitations

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this one it focuses on levitations

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.090 
this one it focuses on levitations
obviously<00:00:44.399> there's<00:00:45.270> floats<00:00:46.140> vanishes<00:00:46.890> all

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
obviously there's floats vanishes all

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
obviously there's floats vanishes all
sorts<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> stuff<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> bunch<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.950> really

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100

that's<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:55.190> what's<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.520> neat

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that's on there what's also really neat

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
that's on there what's also really neat
about<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.059> app<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.930> completely

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
about this app is that it's completely

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.720 
about this app is that it's completely
free<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.760> comes<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:00.920> 64<00:01:01.920> 240<00:01:02.399> 6

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
free and it comes with I think 64 240 6

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
free and it comes with I think 64 240 6
free<00:01:03.449> tricks<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.220> harm<00:01:05.580> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
free tricks so there's really no harm in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120 
free tricks so there's really no harm in
getting<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.330> because<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:07.950> you're

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
getting this because you know you're

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
getting this because you know you're
going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.729> something<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> at

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
going to get something out of it at

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
going to get something out of it at
least<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.799> want<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.400> pay

for the other probably 15 other tricks
that<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that they have on there which are I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
that they have on there which are I

each and or maybe some are might be as

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.410 
each and or maybe some are might be as
cheap<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.460> dollar<00:01:23.700> they're<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.150> very

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
