mass airflow sensor for that style so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.130 
mass airflow sensor for that style so
the<00:01:45.440> engine<00:01:45.740> center<00:01:46.130> island<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:49.520> hear<00:01:49.910> it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.800 

so<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.700> needs<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.209> bit<00:02:09.390> more<00:02:09.569> work<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so two needs a little bit more work but

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.230 
so two needs a little bit more work but
it's<00:02:10.200> at<00:02:10.350> least<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.800> sufficient<00:02:11.400> tune<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.970> allow
