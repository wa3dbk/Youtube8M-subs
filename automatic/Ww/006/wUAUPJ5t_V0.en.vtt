this clay balls in it the filter in
there<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> moment<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:37.380> catching<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> bit

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
there at the moment just catching a bit

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
there at the moment just catching a bit
of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.899> clay<00:00:39.899> ball<00:00:40.170> dust<00:00:41.180> I've<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> bell

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of the clay ball dust I've got a bell

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
of the clay ball dust I've got a bell
siphon<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:45.860> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.989> what<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
siphon here which is what i use to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.470 
siphon here which is what i use to
regulate<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> water<00:00:50.690> using<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.160> drain<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
regulate the water using a drain and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.010 
regulate the water using a drain and
flood<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:56.370> tomato<00:00:57.120> plant<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flood this tomato plant is actually a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.430 
flood this tomato plant is actually a
transplant<00:00:59.480> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.629> sitting<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> laundry

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
transplant it was sitting in the laundry

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.060 
transplant it was sitting in the laundry
for<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:02.160> two<00:01:02.789> months<00:01:03.199> until<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
for about two months until I put it in

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.719 
for about two months until I put it in
here<00:01:06.680> just<00:01:07.680> had<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> rid<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
here just had to get rid of it out of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
here just had to get rid of it out of
there<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.270> somewhere<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.960> I've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
there and put it somewhere so I've

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
there and put it somewhere so I've
decided<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.560> plant<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:12.770> we<00:01:13.770> look<00:01:13.890> down

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
decided to plant it in here we look down

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.120 
decided to plant it in here we look down
here<00:01:14.280> we've<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:16.670> some<00:01:17.670> bio<00:01:17.880> balls<00:01:19.430> in<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:22.130> PVC

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here we've got some bio balls in a PVC

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
here we've got some bio balls in a PVC
tube<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:24.780> pipe<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.240> coming

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
tube this pipe here is actually coming

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.440 
tube this pipe here is actually coming
from<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> center<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.270> bell

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
from the center of the of the bell

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
from the center of the of the bell
siphon<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> part<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.829> where<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
siphon and this part here where the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.260 
siphon and this part here where the
water's<00:01:35.369> coming<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.189> sort<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
water's coming out is just a sort of a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
water's coming out is just a sort of a
pressure<00:01:39.509> relief<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.320> pump<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.100> bottom

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pressure relief the pump in the bottom

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.039 
pressure relief the pump in the bottom
of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> bottom<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> bucket

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
of the in the bottom of the bucket

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.179 
of the in the bottom of the bucket
bottom<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> wheelie<00:01:46.380> bin<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.979> too

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bottom of the wheelie bin is a bit too

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.350 
bottom of the wheelie bin is a bit too
strong<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> valve<00:01:50.030> which<00:01:51.030> allows

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
strong so i put in a valve which allows

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
strong so i put in a valve which allows
the<00:01:51.570> water<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.899> some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> come<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the water to some of it to come up here

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
the water to some of it to come up here
and<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.570> across<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.890> up

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and some of it to go across there and up

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.959 
and some of it to go across there and up
and<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:59.189> idea<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.640> putting<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and out here the idea of putting it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.940 
and out here the idea of putting it
through<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> bio-balls<00:02:00.930> means<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:02.299> gets

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
through the bio-balls means that gets

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.510 
through the bio-balls means that gets
bacteria<00:02:05.420> cleaned<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.829> then<00:02:07.829> also<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.340> gets

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
bacteria cleaned and then also it gets

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.290 
bacteria cleaned and then also it gets
eroded<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:09.090> well

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
eroded as well

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.700 
eroded as well
there's<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.360> little<00:02:11.480> hole<00:02:11.600> drilled<00:02:12.260> down<00:02:12.470> there

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
there's a little hole drilled down there

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.840 
there's a little hole drilled down there
with<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> bit<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.070> water<00:02:13.220> coming<00:02:13.490> out<00:02:13.610> batch

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
with a bit of water coming out batch

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.670 
with a bit of water coming out batch
from<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.830> previous<00:02:16.340> attempt<00:02:17.300> at<00:02:17.440> aeration<00:02:18.440> I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
from the previous attempt at aeration I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.930 
from the previous attempt at aeration I
had<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> tube<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:20.060> there<00:02:20.440> acting<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> venturi

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.300 

so<00:02:25.940> one<00:02:26.240> once<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.750> bell<00:02:26.930> siphon<00:02:27.170> kicks<00:02:28.100> off

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
so one once the bell siphon kicks off

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.970 
so one once the bell siphon kicks off
which<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.700> not<00:02:29.030> too<00:02:29.270> far<00:02:29.300> away<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.120> see

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
which is not too far away as you can see

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.570 
which is not too far away as you can see
the<00:02:33.980> water<00:02:34.100> levels<00:02:34.520> up<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> moment

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
the water levels up and in a moment

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.920 
the water levels up and in a moment
there<00:02:37.910> will<00:02:38.000> be<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.240> little<00:02:38.570> bit<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.750> water

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there will be a little bit of water

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.240 
there will be a little bit of water
coming<00:02:39.170> out<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.440> here<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:39.920> then<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.160> will

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
coming out of here and then it will

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.830 
coming out of here and then it will
start<00:02:40.460> cashing<00:02:40.700> out<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.640> let's<00:02:43.850> just<00:02:44.120> wait

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
start cashing out so let's just wait

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.810 
start cashing out so let's just wait
that<00:02:45.110> there<00:02:45.320> goes<00:02:45.560> bit<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.920> water<00:02:48.459> here<00:02:49.459> this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
that there goes bit of water here this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:03:01.080 
that there goes bit of water here this
warrior<00:02:50.180> matrix<00:02:52.030> tough-on-crime<00:02:56.110> you'll<00:02:57.110> see

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.210 

the<00:03:02.090> water<00:03:02.300> comes<00:03:02.510> bell<00:03:02.720> siphon<00:03:02.990> coming<00:03:03.530> out

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.280 

guessing<00:03:07.030> here<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.860> look<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.190> here<00:03:10.290> waters

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
guessing here we look up here waters

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.190 
guessing here we look up here waters
draining

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.729 

and<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.890> water<00:03:15.099> here<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.640> still<00:03:15.879> coming<00:03:16.360> out

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
and the water here is still coming out

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.710 
and the water here is still coming out
so<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.860> water<00:03:18.040> coming<00:03:18.340> out<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.519> here<00:03:18.790> is

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
so the water coming out of here is

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.420 
so the water coming out of here is
coming<00:03:20.050> out<00:03:20.170> slower<00:03:20.440> than<00:03:20.680> its<00:03:20.860> draining<00:03:21.160> from

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
coming out slower than its draining from

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.960 
coming out slower than its draining from
here<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.890> therefore<00:03:24.099> aggro<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:25.030> empties

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.880 

there's<00:03:29.600> no<00:03:29.750> fish<00:03:29.990> in<00:03:30.020> here<00:03:30.200> at<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.380> moment<00:03:30.740> my

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
there's no fish in here at the moment my

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.170 
there's no fish in here at the moment my
way<00:03:32.050> put<00:03:33.160> got<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> bigger<00:03:34.460> fish<00:03:34.640> tank<00:03:34.880> inside

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
way put got a bigger fish tank inside

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.370 
way put got a bigger fish tank inside
and<00:03:35.420> I'll<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.660> use<00:03:36.020> some<00:03:36.320> water<00:03:36.710> from<00:03:37.520> there

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
and I'll just use some water from there

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.290 
and I'll just use some water from there
to<00:03:39.380> help<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.650> bacteria<00:03:40.160> get<00:03:40.340> started

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.660 

so<00:03:46.900> that's<00:03:47.050> emptying<00:03:47.410> out<00:03:48.060> now<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:51.430> water

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
so that's emptying out now just water

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.560 
so that's emptying out now just water
down<00:03:52.060> here<00:03:54.390> he's<00:03:55.390> only<00:03:55.570> been<00:03:55.780> half<00:03:55.990> way<00:03:56.020> out

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
down here he's only been half way out

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.530 
down here he's only been half way out
wait<00:03:58.570> for<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.750> bit<00:03:58.870> longer<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:01.060> then<00:04:01.120> I'll<00:04:01.300> show

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
wait for a bit longer and then I'll show

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:12.090 
wait for a bit longer and then I'll show
you<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:03.210> bell<00:04:04.210> siphon<00:04:04.450> works

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:20.200 

it<00:04:12.640> was<00:04:12.850> cussing<00:04:13.210> up

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:29.570 

must<00:04:21.210> be<00:04:21.360> nearly<00:04:21.540> done<00:04:22.100> not<00:04:23.100> far<00:04:23.370> off

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.880 

nearly<00:04:30.580> nearly<00:04:31.290> while<00:04:32.290> we're<00:04:32.410> waiting<00:04:32.710> if<00:04:32.800> you

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
nearly nearly while we're waiting if you

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.890 
nearly nearly while we're waiting if you
have<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.010> look<00:04:33.160> here<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:34.570> cut<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:36.690> was<00:04:37.690> whether

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
have a look here is cut here was whether

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.760 
have a look here is cut here was whether
where<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.320> cut<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.950> onion<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:41.020> growth<00:04:41.470> yeah

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
where I cut the onion this growth yeah

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.210 
where I cut the onion this growth yeah
that's<00:04:42.040> about<00:04:43.410> it's<00:04:44.410> actually<00:04:44.800> three<00:04:45.070> days

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
that's about it's actually three days

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.130 
that's about it's actually three days
growth<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.180> that's<00:04:46.330> pretty<00:04:46.510> impressive<00:04:46.720> and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
growth so that's pretty impressive and

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.170 
growth so that's pretty impressive and
the<00:04:48.070> system<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.430> not<00:04:48.580> even<00:04:48.760> operating

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
the system is not even operating

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.860 
the system is not even operating
properly<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:50.590> still<00:04:51.750> cycling<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:55.630> hear<00:04:55.840> a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
properly it's still cycling you hear a

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.270 
properly it's still cycling you hear a
little<00:04:56.020> slope<00:04:56.410> in<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.650> minute<00:04:56.860> which<00:04:56.980> is<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
little slope in a minute which is the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:07.659 
little slope in a minute which is the
bell<00:04:57.610> siphon<00:04:57.850> cutting<00:04:58.360> off

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.210
