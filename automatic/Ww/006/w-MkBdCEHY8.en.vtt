00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
didn't want to give the ball right back
and<00:02:12.720> again<00:02:13.320> we<00:02:13.500> find<00:02:13.530> herself<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> exact

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
and again we find herself in the exact

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.700 
and again we find herself in the exact
same<00:02:14.730> situation<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.630> didn't<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> open

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710

same situation I didn't see the open
receiver<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.460> i<00:02:17.910> overestimated

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
receiver and i overestimated

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.050 
receiver and i overestimated
Bridgewater's<00:02:19.980> speed<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.400> thought<00:02:20.760> Teddy

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
Bridgewater's speed I thought Teddy

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.900 
Bridgewater's speed I thought Teddy
could<00:02:21.270> get<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> corner<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.740> could<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.580> and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
could get to the corner he could not and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.400 
could get to the corner he could not and
that<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.240> little<00:02:24.390> too<00:02:24.540> far<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.990> be<00:02:25.080> trying

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
that was a little too far to be trying

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
that was a little too far to be trying
that<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.490> mean<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.180> I'm<00:02:27.420> normally<00:02:27.840> not

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that and I mean like I'm normally not

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930 
that and I mean like I'm normally not
that<00:02:28.290> aggressive<00:02:28.530> when<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.040> comes<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.520> madden

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
that aggressive when it comes to madden

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.940 
that aggressive when it comes to madden
but<00:02:30.210> that's<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.440> felt<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.830> you

that's<00:06:12.379> definitely<00:06:12.919> what<00:06:13.129> I'm<00:06:13.250> shooting<00:06:13.430> for

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
that's definitely what I'm shooting for

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.149 
that's definitely what I'm shooting for
and<00:06:13.969> let's<00:06:14.509> see<00:06:14.719> Watkins<00:06:14.990> down<00:06:15.409> the<00:06:15.589> side<00:06:15.830> he

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
and let's see Watkins down the side he

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.119 
and let's see Watkins down the side he
stayed<00:06:16.460> inbounds<00:06:16.899> unlike<00:06:17.899> men<00:06:18.199> and<00:06:18.409> 15<00:06:18.860> that

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
stayed inbounds unlike men and 15 that

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.200 
stayed inbounds unlike men and 15 that
would<00:06:19.339> have<00:06:19.430> just<00:06:19.610> gone<00:06:19.729> straight<00:06:19.939> out<00:06:20.180> of

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
would have just gone straight out of

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.999 
would have just gone straight out of
balance<00:06:20.569> he<00:06:20.689> was<00:06:20.870> able<00:06:21.020> to<00:06:21.349> keep<00:06:21.529> his<00:06:21.770> balance

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
balance he was able to keep his balance

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.029 
balance he was able to keep his balance
and<00:06:22.310> get<00:06:23.029> good<00:06:23.210> yardage<00:06:23.629> third<00:06:24.050> and<00:06:24.319> seven<00:06:24.889> got
