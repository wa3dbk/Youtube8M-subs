 I'm going to teach art some rich little slices 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.550
 of the body in lack of chilies with 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.430
 chile pipitilla the preparation is of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.930
 approximately 10 or 15 minutes in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.160
 Cooking time is approximately 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 35 minutes 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.890
 the ingredients for this recipe are a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 kilo of pork ribs cut into 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.840
 pieces three tablespoons of vegetable oil 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.449
 a quarter cup of fresh coriander the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.379
 half a small onion a tooth 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.089
 of garlic from 15 to 20 chiles pipitilla if not 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.190
 you find this chile 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.250
 you can use chile guajillo or chile new 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.159
 Mexico we also need 10 to 15 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.890
 tomatillos salt to taste and 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.320
 about a cup of water you can 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.690
 use a little less water or a little more 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.399
 depending on how liquid you like it 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.399
 the sauce let's start 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 in a large saucepan over medium heat 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.550
 Heat the vegetable oil and brown the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.830
 little ribs until well browned 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.659
 everywhere this will take 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.240
 approximately 10 to 15 minutes 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.149
 while the little things are golden now 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 on a hot comal dora chiles 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.850
 dry for about 5 seconds on each side 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.490
 it's very important that you do not toss the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.679
 chiles others a couple of seconds are 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.140
 enough for the chiles to take a 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.030
 smoked flavor if those who more or 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.310
 Toasted others your sauce will be very 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.439
 bitter I recommend you only pains 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.590
 two or three chilies at a time 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.160
 avoid burning them since the peppers are 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.500
 Toast we reserve for a moment and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.629
 now in the same company the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.239
 tomatillos for about two or three minutes 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.640
 on each side or until the skin is 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.640
 blister and soften a little 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.450
 since the tomatillos if the peppers are 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:32.349
 golden now in a blender grinds the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.280
 chiles with onion cilantro garlic 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.650
 and the tomatillos add salt to taste and 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.280
 also add about one cup 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.439
 of water grinds everything well for 45 minutes at 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.709
 high speed or until everything is 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.109
 incorporated in a soft sauce make sure 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.749
 of grinding at high speed so that the 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.760
 sauce is not too sticky since the 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:58.000
 sauce is ready by a 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.609
 moment as the ribs are 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.519
 golden now add them the red sauce 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.919
 if you like you can school the sauce for 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.930
 that is not very sticky but if the 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.299
 sauce is well ground is not necessary 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.000
 which which is add more water to the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.850
 saucepan if what is necessary 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.250
 and continue sewing for about 10 or 15 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.260
 minutes more at medium low heat or until 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.990
 that the sauce boils as it is 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.900
 boiling test the seasoning and add salt 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.570
 if necessary, if you like, you can also 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.430
 add a little ground pepper but 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.070
 the sauce has so much flavor that really 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.250
 the pepper is not necessary let boil 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.150
 for 5 more minutes and that's all you're 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.549
 ready to serve 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.250
 this dish is delicious with any 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.110
