full bodied cigar and a medium strength

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880 
full bodied cigar and a medium strength
cigar<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:23.900> probably<00:02:24.170> good<00:02:24.380> smoke<00:02:24.710> any

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890

time<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.280> day<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.730> probably<00:02:25.970> recommended<00:02:26.750> in

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
time of day but probably recommended in

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.940 
time of day but probably recommended in
the<00:02:27.020> evening<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.830> bolder<00:02:28.400> flavor<00:02:29.950> while

the evening for the bolder flavor while
the<00:02:31.100> draw<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> little<00:02:31.910> difficult<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the draw was a little difficult at the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
the draw was a little difficult at the
beginning<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> cigar<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> opened<00:02:33.950> up

throughout<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.700> cigar<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.120> by<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.780> final

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
throughout the cigar and by the final

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.880 
throughout the cigar and by the final
third<00:02:36.500> wasn't<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.340> optimal<00:02:37.790> place<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
third wasn't an optimal place the
