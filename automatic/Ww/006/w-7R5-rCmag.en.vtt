00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.750
 Hello, how are you welcome? 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.670
 new tutorial on this occasion is from a 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.980
 application called dicas tepache 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.480
 this is to fix the games that 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 Need fix in our 2014 or 2013 r4 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.260
 and good that is the fix the fix is ​​let's say 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.760
 a patch process that is put to 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.430
 the games so they can run 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.990
 perfectly in our flash cards a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.210
 example is this game that 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.329
 flame yugioh five 10 world championship 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.829
 2011 is the over the nexus and what you 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.659
 happens this game is that the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.999
 developers put a padlock 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.149
 anti-piracy then when we 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:43.309
 we copy the clean rom to our r4 what 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.190
 what happens is that the game starts but at 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.440
 moment of wanting to perform a duel in 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.870
 the first shift gets stuck and good 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.789
 we need to fix this the only thing 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.069
 what we need is good to download the 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.379
 file that they leave in the description 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.510
 once they have downloaded it they believe 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.920
 a folder where you want and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.059
 these two files are copied 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.659
 unzip in that folder and good 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.170
 the game to pixel to patch what we copy 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.329
 together, the process in the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.649
 application does practically only what 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.700
 only one thing to do is good 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.490
 drag the game file next to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.039
 what these two files and the only thing that 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.110
 we do is overpower it when we did 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.710
 we wait for us to appear 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.899
 We are going to give you a window and 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.119
 can see we already have two files one 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.459
 follow one is a back file and if not what 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.610
 let's use and the other one is the file 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.189
 9 n bs that is already our patched game 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.020
 now it is very important too 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.979
 mention that games that already have 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.130
 patch 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.750
 we are going to appear this we are going to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.970
 treat it over and it will appear 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.110
 an error code here of what good 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.200
 this game is already already set then 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.959
 if our rom does not run our r4 and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.240
 we try to patch it and it appears to us that 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.030
 it already means that development is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.070
 damaged and we can try another one now 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.490
 well if we do not know if the rom needs 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.800
 patch or not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.780
 and maybe it's not good we can try 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.300
 this procedure and we will already know 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.910
 patch not and if it is fixed or I do not wait 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.710
 I have helped you a greeting and see you 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.710
 in the next video see you later
