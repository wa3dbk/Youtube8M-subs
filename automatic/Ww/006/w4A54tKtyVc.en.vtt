00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
but I just find the whole notion of
banning<00:00:34.260> books<00:00:34.290> absolutely<00:00:35.190> ridiculous

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
there is no reason to prevent people
from<00:00:39.390> reading<00:00:39.750> books<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
from reading books that they want to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.490 
from reading books that they want to
read<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:42.000> ridiculous<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.020> can't
