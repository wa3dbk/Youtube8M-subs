00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.680 
pretty good here those two tied up balls
air<00:04:48.070> do<00:04:48.280> they<00:04:48.310> seem<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.150> problem<00:04:49.360> or

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
air do they seem to be a problem or

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.089 
air do they seem to be a problem or
anything<00:04:49.810> maybe<00:04:50.199> one<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.470> them<00:04:50.650> goes<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.009> the

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
anything maybe one of them goes in the

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.730 
anything maybe one of them goes in the
side<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.669> thought<00:04:52.539> that<00:04:52.599> one<00:04:53.080> went<00:04:53.349> in<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.500> side

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
side I thought that one went in the side

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.110 
side I thought that one went in the side
but<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.009> don't<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.430> if<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.669> goes<00:04:54.849> in<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but I don't know if it goes in the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.779 
but I don't know if it goes in the
corner<00:04:55.509> or<00:04:55.630> not<00:04:55.919> from<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.070> angle<00:04:57.130> he<00:04:57.610> might

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
corner or not from this angle he might

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.839 
corner or not from this angle he might
elect<00:04:58.349> he<00:04:59.349> might<00:04:59.560> make<00:04:59.740> this<00:04:59.979> ball<00:05:00.280> come<00:05:00.639> down

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
elect he might make this ball come down

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.089 
elect he might make this ball come down
a<00:05:00.880> little<00:05:01.090> bit<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.570> then<00:05:01.630> he's<00:05:02.440> looking<00:05:02.830> at<00:05:02.949> an

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
a little bit and then he's looking at an

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.860 
a little bit and then he's looking at an
angle<00:05:03.430> where<00:05:03.580> he<00:05:03.759> can<00:05:04.000> separate<00:05:04.630> those<00:05:04.840> two

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
angle where he can separate those two

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.460 
angle where he can separate those two
balls<00:05:05.349> go<00:05:05.680> into<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.099> balls<00:05:06.900> but<00:05:07.900> more

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
balls go into the balls but more

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.100 
balls go into the balls but more
importantly<00:05:08.979> where<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.729> two<00:05:10.000> walls<00:05:10.030> lion<00:05:10.780> is

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
importantly where the two walls lion is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.779 
importantly where the two walls lion is
a<00:05:11.169> good<00:05:11.590> break<00:05:13.979> he<00:05:14.979> didn't<00:05:15.250> come<00:05:15.460> off<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
a good break he didn't come off the

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.610 
a good break he didn't come off the
roadway<00:05:16.210> kinda<00:05:16.659> wanna<00:05:16.840> but<00:05:17.080> now<00:05:17.229> that<00:05:17.470> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
roadway kinda wanna but now that the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.550 
roadway kinda wanna but now that the
ideal<00:05:18.009> shot<00:05:18.340> here<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.789> to<00:05:18.970> hit<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:19.449> and<00:05:20.349> hit

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
ideal shot here is to hit this and hit

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.689 
ideal shot here is to hit this and hit
the<00:05:20.740> top<00:05:21.009> off<00:05:22.650> route<00:05:23.650> moving<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.159> bottom<00:05:24.490> wall

the top off route moving the bottom wall

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.649 
the top off route moving the bottom wall
which<00:05:25.419> he<00:05:25.599> did<00:05:25.900> he<00:05:26.349> did<00:05:26.590> which<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.889> action<00:05:27.370> but

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
which he did he did which is action but

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.380 
which he did he did which is action but
no<00:05:28.659> we<00:05:28.900> would<00:05:29.169> actually

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
no we would actually

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.470 
no we would actually
he<00:05:31.390> still<00:05:31.690> may<00:05:31.900> be<00:05:31.930> able<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.970> cut<00:05:33.970> this<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.390> the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
he still may be able to cut this in the

side come around three rails and have a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.450 
side come around three rails and have a
shot<00:05:37.300> on<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.720> two<00:05:37.960> ball<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.580> break<00:05:39.820> I'll<00:05:41.460> or

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
shot on the two ball and a break I'll or

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.020 
shot on the two ball and a break I'll or
he<00:05:42.910> might<00:05:43.090> elect<00:05:43.420> if<00:05:43.660> he<00:05:43.840> wants<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.500> bank<00:05:45.030> bank

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
he might elect if he wants to bank bank

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.470 
he might elect if he wants to bank bank
the<00:05:46.240> ball<00:05:46.420> and<00:05:46.690> follow<00:05:47.560> it<00:05:48.090> see<00:05:49.090> what<00:05:49.300> he's

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
the ball and follow it see what he's

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.040 
the ball and follow it see what he's
gonna<00:05:49.600> do<00:05:49.870> I<00:05:50.230> believe<00:05:50.980> he's<00:05:51.100> called<00:05:51.340> safe<00:05:51.640> oh

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
gonna do I believe he's called safe oh

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.660 
gonna do I believe he's called safe oh
he's<00:05:53.050> elected<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.590> play<00:05:53.740> safe<00:05:54.070> he<00:05:54.280> didn't<00:05:54.580> like

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
he's elected to play safe he didn't like

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.300 
he's elected to play safe he didn't like
the<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.810> angle<00:05:56.170> well<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.650> was<00:05:56.740> a<00:05:56.770> bad<00:05:57.010> break

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
the the angle well that was a bad break

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.240 
the the angle well that was a bad break
but<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.180> idea<00:05:58.540> was<00:05:58.600> there<00:05:58.990> where<00:05:59.260> he<00:05:59.890> wanted

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250

Hopkins to the table and staple it might

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.680 
Hopkins to the table and staple it might
be<00:06:47.860> a<00:06:47.890> hundred<00:06:48.250> balls<00:06:48.580> later<00:06:48.910> before<00:06:49.180> you<00:06:49.510> get
