00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
definitely in the top two

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.480 
definitely in the top two
the<00:00:50.390> guys<00:00:50.630> from<00:00:50.660> Morrisville<00:00:51.560> North<00:00:51.740> Carolina

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
the guys from Morrisville North Carolina

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.610 
the guys from Morrisville North Carolina
JB<00:00:52.940> Moni<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.420> Shane<00:00:53.750> Proctor<00:00:54.260> had<00:00:54.410> some

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
JB Moni and Shane Proctor had some

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.720 
JB Moni and Shane Proctor had some
highlights<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:55.070> their<00:00:55.190> own<00:00:55.370> yeah<00:00:56.770> very<00:00:57.770> good

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
highlights of their own yeah very good

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.610 
highlights of their own yeah very good
I<00:00:58.760> think<00:00:59.360> I<00:00:59.540> think<00:00:59.750> Shane<00:01:00.020> could<00:01:00.320> have<00:01:00.440> just

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
I think I think Shane could have just

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.319 
I think I think Shane could have just
used<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.950> little<00:01:01.130> bit<00:01:01.220> more<00:01:01.340> bull<00:01:01.730> power<00:01:02.000> and

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
used a little bit more bull power and

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.999 
used a little bit more bull power and
Jay<00:01:03.020> beam<00:01:03.230> needed<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.369> not<00:01:04.519> let<00:01:04.759> one<00:01:04.939> slip<00:01:05.180> away

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
Jay beam needed to not let one slip away

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.889 
Jay beam needed to not let one slip away
and<00:01:07.009> then<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.280> look<00:01:07.430> at<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.869> consistency<00:01:08.869> of

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
and then you look at the consistency of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.280 
and then you look at the consistency of
Silvano<00:01:09.409> Alves<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:11.720> know<00:01:11.810> that's<00:01:12.020> just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
Silvano Alves you know that's just

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.770 
Silvano Alves you know that's just
that's<00:01:12.860> killing<00:01:13.399> them<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.299> same<00:01:14.540> time

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
that's killing them but at the same time

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.859 
that's killing them but at the same time
I<00:01:14.810> feel<00:01:15.109> like<00:01:15.170> Silvano<00:01:16.299> gave<00:01:17.299> up<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.600> first

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
I feel like Silvano gave up a first

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.899 
I feel like Silvano gave up a first
place<00:01:18.079> in<00:01:18.469> in<00:01:18.679> order<00:01:18.889> to<00:01:18.979> have<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> third<00:01:19.609> place

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
place in in order to have a third place

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.639 
place in in order to have a third place
