00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 the picnic fair DIY or 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.139
 scrap fair 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.480
 we can imagine everything and even the worst at 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.550
 about the hill climb of this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 delivery man and escape and beautiful prices 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.930
 Mechanical butter sausage there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 effect that a step that separates the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.420
 stuffing seriousness too to have a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.490
 more precise idea 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 automoto went to plant his trestles to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
 casings saint-jérôme between town in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.300
 bresse and ambérieu where the association 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.510
 sports of the organized run of a round 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 of the championship of France of the mountain 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 lobbied you know what it is a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 start a fast ascent 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 an arrival all between two chronos 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 and we go down again to start afresh 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.649
 at least up for testing and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.649
 two for the race 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.250
 so it's on this occasion that we 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.350
 have observed the microcosm of the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 mountain there is on one side the marginal 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.250
 renault 4 minivan brought their 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 nest installed centrally 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.159
 rear 5-speed gearbox 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 synchronized and delivery on demand 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 in front there are the professionals here on 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.000
 speak in terms of two martinis formula 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.439
 chevron ralt to gs and 300 engine 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.439
 horses at a bmw 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 finally between the marginalized and the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.850
 professionals there are the others the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.070
 amateurs what constitutes the strong 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.940
 from the slalom coast and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 regional rally 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.890
 that is to say the great mass of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.890
 fired 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.270
 here no ambition except that of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.909
 enjoy 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.560
 whether for the village grocer the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.350
 sorcerer of mechanics gone bad 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.130
 for example where the wealthy owner 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.130
 earthling 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.800
 it is obviously among the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.720
 professionals we found the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.780
 champions race god thank you she is not 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.580
 not endangered in the race of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.260
 coast as elsewhere of a slow rhyme with 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.930
 money so that's where we see the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.820
 most competitive material from 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.930
 Formula 2 European Championships or 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 formula 3 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.620
 the mountain she best outlets the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.620
 the car market opportunities 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.170
 these champions you have probably 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.450
 admire in other circumstances months 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.159
 for example christian of bias that was 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.439
 one of the great animators of the formula 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.760
 renault in 75 especially when 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.760
 won the national title 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.610
 here is the current champion mavericks 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.470
 of France from the mountain and who was 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.659
 previously one of the pioneers of the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.489
 historic car race lannister 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.790
 jaguar for example has no secrets 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.790
 for her 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.020
 here is marcel tarres the indisputable 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 leader of the specialty 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.500
 the professional among the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 professional 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.670
 after a terrible accident at the end of 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.710
 the season 80 he found the courage to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 get well 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.550
 to build his own car of 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.590
 prepare his own engines and 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.980
 conquer a first title of champion 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.600
 of France 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.350
 it is today part of the same 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.350
 khan babar team 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.840
 the levels of marcel tarries is called 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.450
 from also gerard sciberras he's driving 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.360
 a prototype lola comes to neck brace tools 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.210
 henri paul magnan and daniel boccar all 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.920
 Driver f2 or f3 many guys 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.260
 who are not afraid to pass the case of 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.140
 230 per hour between the trees the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.490
 rocks and precipices so at the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 discovery of these champions of the 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.170
 mountain they are the best lawyers 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.320
 of this specialty too little known here 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.900
 anbaa true 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.120
 for me the rib race departure was 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.160
 especially a way to start the race 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.990
 self dream it takes forwards i try to 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.070
 the old car on circuit the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.010
 modern cars I did not know 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.930
 absolutely not and besides it was the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.840
 best way for financial time 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.630
 that's what allowed me to less 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.830
 fresh to already have a good car 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.120
 money that's obviously what's a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.440
 touch I would like to do for example 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.210
 trials I'm compared to my 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.770
 direct competitors in Formula 2 and 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.570
 neophytes game it's been three seasons that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.460
 I run and they do that about 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.650
 average ten years sometimes more 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.570
 so for me I'm a beginner by 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.370
 report to them because you have a 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.020
 certain extent that I played in 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.980
 hill climbing 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.030
 yes by the way I just finished 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.770
 my tea 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.940
 I did not attack so much 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.980
 found even after a little down 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.200
 the tours because I prefer to prepare 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.700
 the race that way rather than 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.050
 to attack too hard and will be able to see where 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.450
 I am and can not do 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.790
 better in race so I prefer to know 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.320
 red can go faster to give 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.930
 all I can on behalf of the cause 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.120
 even to my true when you will be famous 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.280
 because you will do when I am 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.450
 not yet famous was a little bit 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.890
 known in the middle of the race of 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.350
 coast because I'm the only woman to 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.130
 run in f2 finally even in another 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.120
 discipline until home finally it's 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.530
 what I hope is mostly a lot 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500
 progressed as a coach I still 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.820
 a lot a lot to learn and the pac 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.290
 well, I go from time to time 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.400
 was not enough to do face 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.570
 do not satisfy me then when I will be 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.070
 quite satisfied we will see 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.510
 I would like to redo the circuit because 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.940
 I did it in vintage cars before 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.310
 but it's really in the smell of my 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.800
 financial means formula 2 it's 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.969
 your only passion the formula is my 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.539
 passion 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.539
 no 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.770
 marcel tarres what is it for you the 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.760
 stroke course 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.800
 the code tuning is a little one 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.670
 team and we can compare to 1 2 this 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.610
 who 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.890
 you have to be prepared to prepare 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.540
 psychologically or for recharging 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.270
 the accuses and ten years give you a 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.680
 maximum of oneself for a few 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.080
 second attractions to say a 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.350
 infinitive two minutes roughly his 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.790
 length and races and nearly 5 km 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.890
 because you have a very calendar 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.290
 loaded but the schedule yes is enough 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.910
 ultimately charged I run the month of 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.590
 March until the end of September 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.230
 every weekend and serves close to to 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.380
 about 25 years of corte the season then 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.550
 let's talk finance how a tower dock 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.220
 rib race as you deemed like 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.570
 you earn a living and many sponsors 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.630
 10 they pay me a new material 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.890
 represents the the budget represents 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.500
 material in and philippe iv the 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.960
 movement as to the money I 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.729
 good races but that's what 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.139
 motivates me to get to live because 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.490
 I do not make money through six months 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.659
 of the year during the others if less 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.979
 good but it is sure that there is work 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.259
 but it's the job that does not yield 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.599
 nothing since I build car on 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.930
 pass badly loved we do not speak 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.639
 a lot 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.830
 does this judgment a priori 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.599
 agree with i call participates in 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.120
 25 years scott in 12 mild cases 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:17.400
 that of the championship brings reindeers to little 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.949
 near an average of 7 to 8000 spectators 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.300
 it goes from 5000 to 20000 according to 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.440
 tests so if we can consider a 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.880
 average of 2000 spectators and 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.610
 we have almost every opportunity 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.780
 the tests to pass so include them 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.410
 in the top three of the scratch and 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.810
 I'm part of 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.760
 regional television each 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.980
 test 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.630
 we are entitled to a few minutes of antenna 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.510
 which is still something 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.580
 very well and the one of a lot of 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.440
 newspapers in the end 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.600
 and when automoto is there of course it's 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.250
 even better that day to gut 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.170
 saint-jérôme marcel tarres win 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.180
 in front of daniel boccar the child of the country 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.470
 this victory gave him the first 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.500
 place of the championship of France in front 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:00.260
 gerard xiberras from arras climbed the 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.810
 five kilometers to more than 174 km hour 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.910
 average with a standing start and two 

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.360
 hairpin turns here in a race 

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.580
 of coast 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.290
 there is daring talent and risk 

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.290
 do not hesitate to go there it's not true
