00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.590
 it is small farmer a good day 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.490
 small farmers video presentation 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 video presentation of a graphics card 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 a very small graphics card like 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 you can see it no 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 external power connector 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.790
 this is a map that comes from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.079
 at nvidia is the gtx 750 t it is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 she who will launch the new 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 maxwell architecture of nvidia 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 the surprises are clearly in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.969
 revealing as it was said there is no 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.640
 external power supply 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.329
 the focus was on performance 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.850
 per box 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 so in fact the essence card is very 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 very little consumed while offering 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.989
 interesting performances we're going 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.059
 discover the reference model provided 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500
 by nvidia with a fan that can 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.550
 look ridiculous with departures 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.090
 compared to what we currently know 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.520
 circus simply opens the gpu we see 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.729
 memory chips that are in the air 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 free at the pcb level if black is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.040
 rather nice 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.369
 we notice that at the connectors 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.159
 the card can easily be compatible 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.950
 with a slot occupancy one finds 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.610
 an exit dvi one or two exits dvi 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 and a mini hdmi output leaves us 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.970
 take a tour of this little map 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.970
 graphic 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:47.700
 at the level of the characteristics the map 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.200
 enjoys 640 cuda cores the gpu is at 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.770
 1020 billion with boost 2.0 to 1085 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.650
 billion memory is at 1350 meijers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.810
 and the map embeds two August gigas and 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.080
 of gddr5 in 128 bits 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.080
 finally this model because there will be 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.700
 1 or 2 gigabyte models 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.450
 so at the tariff level we would have 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 is around 138 euros 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.930
 Here we did you test it you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.190
 provide 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.190
 very soon a goodbye
