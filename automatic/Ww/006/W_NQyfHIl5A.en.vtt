00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
starts out as a horror movie and then

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.760 
starts out as a horror movie and then
halfway<00:00:39.480> through<00:00:39.660> becomes<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> high<00:00:40.500> seas

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
halfway through becomes a high seas

and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.800> knew<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.789> wanted<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
and I knew that we wanted to make a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
and I knew that we wanted to make a
movie<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> family<00:00:46.469> movie<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
movie that was a family movie that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790 
movie that was a family movie that
showed<00:00:47.100> Josh's<00:00:47.969> character<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> his<00:00:49.289> emotions

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
showed Josh's character and his emotions

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
showed Josh's character and his emotions
the<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.789> part<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.629> through<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the way we do and part way through the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
the way we do and part way through the
movie<00:00:52.140> shift<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:52.980> being<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.340> adventure

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
movie shift into being an adventure

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
movie shift into being an adventure
story<00:00:53.910> while<00:00:54.870> still<00:00:55.140> being<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.440> emotional<00:00:56.010> one

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
story while still being an emotional one

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.209 
story while still being an emotional one
so<00:00:56.850> hopefully<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.960> were<00:00:58.079> able<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.070> make

each other you know grow and evolve well

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.199 
each other you know grow and evolve well
I<00:02:59.930> think<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.610> like<00:03:01.610> one<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.880> those<00:03:02.000> things

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
I think it's like one of those things

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.789 
I think it's like one of those things
the<00:03:02.720> negative<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.290> negative<00:03:03.380> makes<00:03:03.680> a

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
the negative and negative makes a

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.270 
the negative and negative makes a
positive<00:03:03.829> like<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.090> damage<00:03:05.420> people

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
positive like just to damage people

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.860 
positive like just to damage people
bonding<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.370> becoming<00:03:07.489> as<00:03:08.239> close<00:03:08.600> as<00:03:08.750> that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
bonding and becoming as close as that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.870 
bonding and becoming as close as that
was<00:03:09.049> it's<00:03:09.260> pretty<00:03:09.769> cathartic<00:03:10.280> for<00:03:10.430> both<00:03:10.760> of

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
was it's pretty cathartic for both of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.630 
was it's pretty cathartic for both of
them<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.239> think<00:03:11.930> they<00:03:12.109> they<00:03:12.650> know<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:13.070> they

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
them and think they they know that they

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.770 
them and think they they know that they
help<00:03:13.850> each<00:03:13.970> other<00:03:14.209> they've<00:03:14.450> helped<00:03:14.690> each

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
help each other they've helped each

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.110 
help each other they've helped each
other<00:03:14.959> throughout<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.560> whole<00:03:16.040> adventure<00:03:16.549> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
other throughout this whole adventure I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.509 
other throughout this whole adventure I
think<00:03:17.750> that's<00:03:17.900> where<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.500> stems<00:03:18.680> from<00:03:18.799> Pamela

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
think that's where it stems from Pamela

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.819 
think that's where it stems from Pamela
had<00:03:19.670> she's<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.030> strong<00:03:20.390> woman<00:03:20.420> how<00:03:21.410> would<00:03:21.620> how

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
had she's a strong woman how would how

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.789 
had she's a strong woman how would how
did<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.780> portray<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.140> such<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.410> way<00:03:24.440> that

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
did you portray that in such a way that

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.560 
did you portray that in such a way that
you<00:03:24.890> were<00:03:24.980> able<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.280> gather<00:03:25.579> her<00:03:25.940> strength<00:03:26.359> and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
you were able to gather her strength and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.690 
you were able to gather her strength and
able<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.709> know<00:03:27.829> your<00:03:28.100> character<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.519> able

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
able to you know your character was able

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.240 
able to you know your character was able
to<00:03:28.760> keep<00:03:28.940> her<00:03:29.030> family<00:03:29.239> together<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:30.049> think<00:03:30.739> it's

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
to keep her family together I think it's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.420 
to keep her family together I think it's
maybe<00:03:32.150> sometimes<00:03:32.780> do<00:03:32.959> your<00:03:33.109> best<00:03:33.350> when<00:03:33.680> you're

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
maybe sometimes do your best when you're

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.490 
maybe sometimes do your best when you're
kind<00:03:34.880> of<00:03:35.000> up<00:03:35.269> against<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.690> wall<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.440> is

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
kind of up against the wall and this is

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.580 
kind of up against the wall and this is
a<00:03:36.680> family<00:03:36.950> who<00:03:37.489> if<00:03:38.239> something<00:03:39.230> doesn't<00:03:39.410> change

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
a family who if something doesn't change

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.099 
a family who if something doesn't change
they're<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.760> fall<00:03:41.120> apart<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.810> face

they're going to fall apart in the face
of<00:03:42.139> this<00:03:42.590> loss<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:44.269> think<00:03:44.829> sometimes

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
of this loss and I think sometimes

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.229 
of this loss and I think sometimes
that's<00:03:45.980> when<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.280> find<00:03:46.519> your<00:03:46.670> strength<00:03:47.000> you

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
that's when you find your strength you

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.840 
that's when you find your strength you
know<00:03:47.359> when<00:03:47.959> when<00:03:48.530> you're<00:03:48.739> faced<00:03:49.160> with<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.609> the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
know when when you're faced with the the
