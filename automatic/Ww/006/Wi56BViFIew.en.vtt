today<00:00:05.520> we'll<00:00:05.670> be<00:00:05.700> programming<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.359> sure<00:00:06.569> PGX

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
today we'll be programming the sure PGX

wireless<00:00:07.589> microphone<00:00:08.040> system<00:00:08.430> step<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.240> is

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
wireless microphone system step one is

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.450 
wireless microphone system step one is
to<00:00:09.480> select<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.930> frequency<00:00:10.170> step<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
to select a frequency step two is to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.759 
to select a frequency step two is to
sync<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.179> transmitter<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.019> receiver<00:00:13.139> so

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
sync the transmitter to the receiver so

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.980 
sync the transmitter to the receiver so
that<00:00:13.800> both<00:00:14.759> transmitter<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> receiver<00:00:15.809> are

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that both transmitter and receiver are

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.350 
that both transmitter and receiver are
on<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.259> same<00:00:16.470> channel<00:00:17.150> there<00:00:18.150> are<00:00:18.210> two

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
on the same channel there are two

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.450 
on the same channel there are two
different<00:00:18.660> ways<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.960> program<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.949> frequency

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
different ways to program the frequency

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.720
