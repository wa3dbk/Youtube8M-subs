00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
still playing though no problem see the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.860 
still playing though no problem see the
difference<00:02:55.379> is<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.890> wish<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.000> Wii<00:02:57.150> U<00:02:57.299> console

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
difference is I wish the Wii U console

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.350 
difference is I wish the Wii U console
would<00:02:58.049> use<00:02:58.970> the<00:03:00.019> internet<00:03:01.019> connection<00:03:02.239> like<00:03:03.239> I

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
would use the internet connection like I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.240 
would use the internet connection like I
said<00:03:03.540> my<00:03:03.720> Reuters<00:03:04.170> over<00:03:04.470> there<00:03:04.620> under<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
said my Reuters over there under the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.089 
said my Reuters over there under the
stairs<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.930> uses<00:03:10.470> my<00:03:10.620> internet

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
stairs and it uses my internet

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.190 
stairs and it uses my internet
connection<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.209> connected

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
connection and it's not connected

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.849 
connection and it's not connected
directly<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:16.700> console<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:19.049> Wii<00:03:19.230> U<00:03:19.500> is

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
directly to the console and the Wii U is

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.670 
directly to the console and the Wii U is
connected<00:03:20.850> directly<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.780> console<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.650> you

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
connected directly to the console so you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.710 
connected directly to the console so you
can't<00:03:23.250> go<00:03:23.400> far<00:03:23.730> from<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:26.209> my<00:03:27.209> point<00:03:27.510> of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
can't go far from it that's my point of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.569 
can't go far from it that's my point of
view<00:03:27.900> that's<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> only<00:03:28.769> bummer<00:03:29.069> why<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:30.410> wish

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
view that's the only bummer why I wish

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:39.800 
view that's the only bummer why I wish
the<00:03:32.579> Wii<00:03:32.790> U<00:03:33.030> mote<00:03:34.190> had<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:37.609> better<00:03:38.609> reach<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.630> see
