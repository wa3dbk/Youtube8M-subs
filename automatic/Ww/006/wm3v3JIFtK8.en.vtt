00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.229
 train to had won 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.960
 maybe it depends on how hard your money is 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.960
 or that will immediately test yes 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.840
 well do tough rides in joris 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.450

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.550
 monopod no maybe just like that in nagele 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.170
 so we can win now 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.120
 maybe you have some information for that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.680
 us well I have an idea 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 listen carefully to the text in it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.170
 the station kills you brave who the dragon 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.310
 beats one thousand and one ducats 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.320
 that is of course told by one 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 maybe he code you it 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.660
 can give an answer but that is very good 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.520
 the radio that questions under magic 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.520
 key or they smile 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.599
 for this technology he was 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.880
 bye Mr. King 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 dumb has a question how much you joris 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.090
 and the dragon 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.610
 the whole country is being suppressed by him 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.890
 gun key to wear 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.900
 yes that is a very good question but 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.990
 I issued a reward 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.870
 dragon hunters intrepid 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
 listen to what the king asks the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.730
 brave 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.450
 he who beats the dragon receives a thousand 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.520
 and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:36.910
 pulls every knight fearlessly in uk 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.190
 fighting the weighs 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.630
 so the brave one who beats the dragon 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.760
 then you have to be so brave 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.040
 that must be someone so brave 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.770
 in front of a nasty one 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.720
 and it would be perilous 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.030
 maybe you can help me 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.900

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.210

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.130
 be the king because they are very brave 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.410
 how they are perhaps less thapsus 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.910
 little one thank you go king 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.210

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.770
 I think you know everything about the Ramona 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.569
 Joris and the dragon where have just arrived 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.670

 it is a very good question to know 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.060
 I got myself the answer to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.310
 has to do with the laws of the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.169
 nature actually comes down to that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.460
 is just very hot should be the brave 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.320
 Thomas the train that eventually wins 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.910
 of the dragon that is actually pretty good 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.130
 very logical that they open so that the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.520
 being king so being brave that is it 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.330

 with your search 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.350
 it was indeed a difficult one 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.570
 search but even with the king 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.479
 spoken and finally doze off 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.620
 answer has to do with the laws 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.000
 of nature 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.100
