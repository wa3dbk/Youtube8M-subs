00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
yo are you doing we got a little at lag

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.440 
yo are you doing we got a little at lag
issue<00:00:03.780> last<00:00:04.500> time<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.670> hopefully<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
issue last time so hopefully it is

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.320 
issue last time so hopefully it is
taking<00:00:07.379> care<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.649> not<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.610> same<00:00:08.880> as<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.150> was

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
taking care of not the same as it was

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.129 
taking care of not the same as it was
last<00:00:11.420> looks<00:00:12.420> like<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> little<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:13.019> better

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
last looks like it's a little bit better

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
last looks like it's a little bit better
so<00:00:13.440> that's<00:00:13.530> good<00:00:13.769> news<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.240> doing

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so that's good news and what we're doing

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.230 
so that's good news and what we're doing
right<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:16.160> we're<00:00:17.160> moving<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.060> have

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
right now is we're moving in and we have

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.279 
right now is we're moving in and we have
to<00:00:18.390> take<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> power<00:00:19.199> source<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:21.510> bunch

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
to take out the power source for a bunch

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.640 
to take out the power source for a bunch
of<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.500> fly<00:00:22.710> cannons<00:00:23.130> Tesla<00:00:23.490> coils<00:00:23.880> around

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
of these fly cannons Tesla coils around

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
of these fly cannons Tesla coils around
theories<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:26.130> stronger<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.109> going

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
theories little stronger so we're going

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.620 
theories little stronger so we're going
to<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.320> north<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:30.410> our<00:00:31.410> key<00:00:31.590> Rob's<00:00:32.300> as<00:00:33.300> far<00:00:33.540> as

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to go north with our key Rob's as far as

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.020 
to go north with our key Rob's as far as
we<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> lot<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> Tesla

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
we can go and they have a lot of Tesla

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
we can go and they have a lot of Tesla
reactors<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.750> they<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
reactors and they actually have a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.330 
reactors and they actually have a
nuclear<00:00:38.399> reactor<00:00:38.780> up<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.200> well<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.410> lets

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
nuclear reactor up there as well so lets

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.540 
nuclear reactor up there as well so lets
you<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:42.020> in<00:00:43.020> range<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you get in range of that you know this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.690 
you get in range of that you know this
black<00:00:44.820> hammock<00:00:45.090> range

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.510 

well<00:00:48.700> it's<00:00:48.940> got<00:00:49.090> some<00:00:49.570> right<00:00:50.400> once<00:00:51.400> you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
well it's got some right once you

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.290 
well it's got some right once you
take<00:00:52.000> care<00:00:52.180> of<00:00:52.239> their<00:00:52.330> power<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:53.200> can<00:00:54.300> shut

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
take care of their power you can shut

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.229 
take care of their power you can shut
off<00:00:55.330> their<00:00:55.540> black<00:00:55.870> canons<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.940> their<00:00:57.940> toes

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
off their black canons and their toes

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.210 
off their black canons and their toes
the<00:00:58.360> reactor<00:00:58.750> does<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.320> coil<00:00:59.800> it's<00:00:59.950> not<00:01:00.070> that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
the reactor does the coil it's not that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.250 
the reactor does the coil it's not that
that<00:01:00.340> matters<00:01:00.550> but<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.059> thank<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.050> for<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
that matters but I thank you for the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.100 
that matters but I thank you for the
heck<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.790> make<00:01:03.790> yuri<00:01:04.059> upset<00:01:04.449> make<00:01:04.989> them<00:01:05.140> mad

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.870 

so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.410> think<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.490> six

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so I think we have to take out all six

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 
so I think we have to take out all six
of<00:01:15.000> these<00:01:15.150> guys<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.080> shut<00:01:16.290> off<00:01:16.410> their<00:01:16.530> power

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of these guys to shut off their power

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
of these guys to shut off their power
but<00:01:17.370> you<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.610> ultimately<00:01:17.850> need<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.960> care

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
but you really ultimately need one care

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
but you really ultimately need one care
of<00:01:19.320> much<00:01:19.530> standing<00:01:22.610> all<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.730> here<00:01:23.940> Artie

possible<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.940> drift<00:01:54.150> up<00:01:54.420> that's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
possible you get the drift up that's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
possible you get the drift up that's
what<00:01:55.530> happened<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.010> was<00:01:56.160> like<00:01:56.400> it's<00:01:57.390> pretty

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
what happened I was like it's pretty

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.859 
what happened I was like it's pretty
suddenly<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.350> got<00:01:58.800> pretty<00:01:59.010> lucky<00:01:59.190> but<00:01:59.580> uh<00:01:59.869> yeah

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
suddenly I got pretty lucky but uh yeah

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.630 
suddenly I got pretty lucky but uh yeah
get<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.440> lucky<00:02:01.650> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.800> time<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.190> not<00:02:02.400> new

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
get pretty lucky all the time so not new
