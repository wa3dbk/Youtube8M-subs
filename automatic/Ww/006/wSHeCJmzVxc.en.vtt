actual articulation how they form words

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970 
actual articulation how they form words
you<00:02:44.239> know<00:02:44.329> how<00:02:44.540> they<00:02:44.659> pronounce<00:02:44.810> words<00:02:45.230> that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
you know how they pronounce words that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.710 
you know how they pronounce words that
sort<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> thing<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.730> they'll<00:02:47.180> also<00:02:47.329> work<00:02:47.599> with

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
sort of thing and they'll also work with

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.970 
sort of thing and they'll also work with
language<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.260> how<00:02:48.440> they<00:02:48.560> use<00:02:48.709> language

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
language you know how they use language

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.030 
language you know how they use language
the<00:02:49.400> syntax<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.180> forth<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.540> grammar<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.620> I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the syntax and so forth of grammar and I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.059 
the syntax and so forth of grammar and I
do<00:02:52.099> some<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:53.379> so<00:02:54.379> I<00:02:54.410> have<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> little<00:02:54.799> bit

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
do some of that so I have a little bit

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.680 
do some of that so I have a little bit
overlap<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:56.000> tend<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.359> look<00:02:56.510> more

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
overlap but I really tend to look more

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.470 
overlap but I really tend to look more
at<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.019> bigger<00:02:57.290> picture<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.730> know<00:02:58.849> how<00:02:59.090> is

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
at the bigger picture you know how is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.750 
at the bigger picture you know how is
her<00:02:59.660> deafness<00:02:59.870> impacting<00:03:00.859> how<00:03:01.579> they're

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
her deafness impacting how they're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.250 
her deafness impacting how they're
communicating<00:03:01.879> with<00:03:02.450> others<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.019> how<00:03:03.109> others

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
communicating with others and how others

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.110 
communicating with others and how others
are<00:03:03.530> communicating<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:04.310> them<00:03:04.489> how<00:03:04.819> does<00:03:05.000> it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
are communicating with them how does it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.899 
are communicating with them how does it
impact<00:03:05.209> how<00:03:06.019> they<00:03:06.170> get<00:03:06.319> information<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.819> know

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
impact how they get information you know

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.160 
impact how they get information you know
and<00:03:08.060> how<00:03:08.120> they<00:03:08.299> give<00:03:08.450> information<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.989> other

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
and how they give information to other

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.259 
and how they give information to other
people<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:10.040> overlap<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.579> teeny<00:03:10.909> bit<00:03:11.120> with

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
people so I overlap a teeny bit with

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.530 
people so I overlap a teeny bit with
these<00:03:11.390> two<00:03:11.599> disciplines<00:03:12.489> I'm<00:03:13.489> really<00:03:13.909> more<00:03:14.120> a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
these two disciplines I'm really more a

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.809 
these two disciplines I'm really more a
teacher<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.769> do<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.069> know<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.640> with

teacher you know do you know just with

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.839 
teacher you know do you know just with
that<00:03:16.849> little<00:03:17.120> bit<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.420> specialty<00:03:18.849> what

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
that little bit of a specialty what

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.729 
that little bit of a specialty what
knowledge<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.569> skills<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.319> think<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
knowledge and skills do you think you

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
lot about that and he'll also language

and cognitive development in turn they

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.550 
and cognitive development in turn they
overlap<00:04:02.090> with<00:04:02.269> each<00:04:02.299> other<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.780> can't<00:04:03.230> have
