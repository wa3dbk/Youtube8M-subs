now<00:02:59.840> go<00:03:00.020> out<00:03:00.170> there<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.440> take<00:03:00.740> it

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.980 

while<00:04:29.069> having<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.550> go<00:04:29.729> like<00:04:30.449> there<00:04:30.629> has<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.840> be

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
bad you're going to do that instead of

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.679 
bad you're going to do that instead of
