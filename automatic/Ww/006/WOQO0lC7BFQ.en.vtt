here's how it went down with the six
minutes<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:31.150> nanu-nanu<00:00:32.180> nano<00:00:37.989> why<00:00:38.989> those

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
minutes of nanu-nanu nano why those

for all you dr m well
let's<00:00:47.449> bind<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.839> up<00:00:47.979> read<00:00:48.979> what<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.280> settings

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
let's bind it up read what the settings

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.850 
let's bind it up read what the settings
are<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.360> i'll<00:00:50.449> hook<00:00:50.510> up<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.870> dx6i<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.739> see

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
are and i'll hook up to the dx6i and see

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.520 
are and i'll hook up to the dx6i and see
how<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.129> goes<00:00:52.280> alright<00:00:53.269> let's<00:00:53.930> see<00:00:54.140> how<00:00:54.320> it

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
how it goes alright let's see how it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.270 
how it goes alright let's see how it
binds<00:00:55.720> like<00:00:56.720> in<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.989> battery<00:00:57.379> first<00:01:00.040> set<00:01:01.040> that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
binds like in the battery first set that

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.649 
binds like in the battery first set that
down<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:02.299> now<00:01:03.220> pull<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.460> switch<00:01:04.670> turn<00:01:05.449> this

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
down and now pull that switch turn this

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:18.480 
down and now pull that switch turn this
on<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.729> there<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.119> bound

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.130 

so<00:01:19.490> let's<00:01:19.700> see<00:01:19.940> here<00:01:20.240> how<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.870> going<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
so let's see here how this is going to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.709 
so let's see here how this is going to
fly

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:03:56.670 

it's<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:30.109> all<00:01:31.109> right

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.860 

you<00:03:57.280> know<00:03:57.430> even<00:03:57.640> with<00:03:57.849> my<00:03:58.000> orange<00:03:58.239> visual<00:03:58.689> aids

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
you know even with my orange visual aids

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.349 
you know even with my orange visual aids
um<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.319> have<00:03:59.650> trouble<00:03:59.980> seeing<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.579> inside<00:04:01.030> here

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
um I have trouble seeing it inside here

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.449 
um I have trouble seeing it inside here
it's<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.989> fleeting<00:04:02.349> pat<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.240 
it's like a fleeting pat you know and
they<00:04:03.879> also<00:04:04.090> require<00:04:05.079> whele<00:04:05.680> stick<00:04:05.980> movements

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
they also require whele stick movements

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.729 
they also require whele stick movements
compared<00:04:06.909> to<00:04:07.000> my<00:04:07.120> bigger<00:04:07.390> heli<00:04:07.719> I<00:04:08.019> wouldn't

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
compared to my bigger heli I wouldn't

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.800 
compared to my bigger heli I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:09.069> this<00:04:09.400> as<00:04:09.609> a<00:04:09.640> learning<00:04:09.969> helicopter

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
recommend this as a learning helicopter

00:04:10.810 --> 00:05:21.930 
recommend this as a learning helicopter
unless<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.319> got<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.560> few<00:04:11.890> extra<00:04:12.069> Birds<00:04:12.549> parts

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.410 

ah<00:05:22.590> there<00:05:23.590> we<00:05:23.680> go<00:05:23.730> out<00:05:24.730> of<00:05:24.880> gas

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
ah there we go out of gas

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.050 
ah there we go out of gas
there's<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.900> whole<00:05:26.140> flight<00:05:26.710> well<00:05:27.490> pretty<00:05:27.850> nice

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
there's a whole flight well pretty nice

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.130 
there's a whole flight well pretty nice
little<00:05:28.450> helicopter<00:05:29.290> for<00:05:29.500> sure<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:31.140> $149

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
little helicopter for sure but for $149

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.840 
little helicopter for sure but for $149
I<00:05:32.290> think<00:05:32.470> it's<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.650> bit<00:05:32.830> pricey<00:05:33.100> that's<00:05:33.610> with<00:05:33.820> no

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
I think it's a bit pricey that's with no

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.020 
I think it's a bit pricey that's with no
radio<00:05:34.270> compared<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.020> say<00:05:35.200> my<00:05:35.410> V<00:05:35.680> 400<00:05:36.340> which

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
radio compared to say my V 400 which

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.000 
radio compared to say my V 400 which
came<00:05:37.330> with<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.540> 7<00:05:37.930> channel<00:05:38.290> computer<00:05:38.830> radio

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
came with a 7 channel computer radio

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.680 
came with a 7 channel computer radio
with<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.520> same<00:05:39.730> price<00:05:42.240> but<00:05:43.240> once<00:05:43.420> you<00:05:43.540> get
