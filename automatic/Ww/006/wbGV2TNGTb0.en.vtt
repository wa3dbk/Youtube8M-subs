acceleration<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.000> 95<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.810> he's<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> really<00:03:31.380> good

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470

moving<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.130> next<00:04:17.400> team<00:04:18.680> mostly

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
moving on to the next team mostly

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.610 
moving on to the next team mostly
Jamaican<00:04:20.190> players<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:20.850> team<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.590> then<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
Jamaican players on this team and then a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.930 
Jamaican players on this team and then a
couple<00:04:23.580> other<00:04:23.880> guys<00:04:24.120> here<00:04:24.630> Shelton<00:04:25.190> he's<00:04:26.190> his

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
couple other guys here Shelton he's his

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.010 
couple other guys here Shelton he's his
pace<00:04:27.300> is<00:04:27.599> 90

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
pace is 90

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.100 
pace is 90
to<00:04:28.199> I<00:04:28.229> believe<00:04:28.770> his<00:04:28.919> acceleration<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:30.060> or<00:04:30.960> no

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
to I believe his acceleration is or no

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.200 
to I believe his acceleration is or no
his<00:04:31.289> face<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.650> 93<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.220> think<00:04:32.520> his<00:04:32.610> acceleration

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
his face is 93 I think his acceleration

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.790 
his face is 93 I think his acceleration
is<00:04:33.569> 94<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.410> then<00:04:35.069> his<00:04:35.340> actual<00:04:35.610> speed<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.210> 92<00:04:36.800> so

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
is 94 and then his actual speed is 92 so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640 
is 94 and then his actual speed is 92 so
he's<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> pretty<00:04:38.819> good<00:04:38.909> player<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.659> then<00:04:40.470> right

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
he's a pretty good player and then right

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.100 
he's a pretty good player and then right
by<00:04:40.800> him<00:04:41.069> the<00:04:41.370> striker<00:04:42.030> from<00:04:42.300> Jamaica<00:04:42.690> foliar

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
