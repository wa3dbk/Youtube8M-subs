00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.730 
have another block so yeah this works
with<00:01:41.350> every<00:01:41.890> block<00:01:42.159> that's<00:01:42.340> placeable<00:01:42.850> I'm

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
with every block that's placeable I'm

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.100 
with every block that's placeable I'm
not<00:01:44.740> sure<00:01:44.799> about<00:01:45.009> like<00:01:45.399> chests<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.299> torches

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
not sure about like chests and torches

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.740 
not sure about like chests and torches
and<00:01:47.380> furnaces<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:47.979> stuff<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.820> think

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
and furnaces and stuff like that I think

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.330 
and furnaces and stuff like that I think
just<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.079> blocks<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.680> can<00:01:50.829> build<00:01:51.070> with

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
just like blocks that you can build with

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
just like blocks that you can build with
um<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.500> yeah<00:01:53.829> it's<00:01:54.189> really<00:01:54.880> cool<00:01:55.000> on<00:01:55.509> and
