00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
guys one goes through how do you make

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.200 
guys one goes through how do you make
someone<00:00:25.010> fall<00:00:25.220> like<00:00:25.369> what's<00:00:25.670> your<00:00:25.730> main<00:00:26.000> thing

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
someone fall like what's your main thing

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.290 
someone fall like what's your main thing
you're<00:00:26.330> looking<00:00:26.450> for<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:27.140> their<00:00:27.260> feet<00:00:27.439> sure

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
you're looking for and their feet sure

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.580 
you're looking for and their feet sure
so<00:00:29.300> first<00:00:29.540> of<00:00:29.689> all<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:30.140> can<00:00:30.290> never<00:00:30.439> really

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
so first of all you can never really

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.820 
so first of all you can never really
plan<00:00:30.950> a<00:00:31.130> fall<00:00:31.550> if<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.510> happens<00:00:32.960> off<00:00:33.290> spur<00:00:33.650> the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
plan a fall if it happens off spur the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.900 
plan a fall if it happens off spur the
moment<00:00:33.860> there's<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.309> couple<00:00:34.640> different<00:00:34.879> ways

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
moment there's a couple different ways

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.490 
moment there's a couple different ways
it<00:00:35.150> happens<00:00:35.449> okay<00:00:35.690> this<00:00:35.989> is<00:00:36.110> just<00:00:36.230> stuff<00:00:36.470> that

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
it happens okay this is just stuff that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.340 
it happens okay this is just stuff that
I've<00:00:36.680> noticed<00:00:37.059> first<00:00:38.059> all<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.720> would<00:00:39.260> say

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
I've noticed first all of it I would say

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.310 
I've noticed first all of it I would say
the<00:00:39.470> number<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:39.739> way<00:00:40.129> would<00:00:40.370> be<00:00:40.430> if<00:00:41.320> you

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
the number one way would be if you

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.770 
the number one way would be if you
changed<00:00:42.680> my<00:00:42.860> center<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.250> gravity<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
changed my center of gravity to the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.240 
changed my center of gravity to the
point<00:00:45.050> where<00:00:45.260> they<00:00:45.620> get<00:00:45.769> ahead<00:00:45.980> of<00:00:46.040> themselves

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
point where they get ahead of themselves

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.360 
point where they get ahead of themselves
so<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.330> I<00:00:47.449> come<00:00:47.629> up<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:48.890> maybe<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.160> give

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
so if I come up to you and maybe I give

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.190 
so if I come up to you and maybe I give
you<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.489> couple<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:49.970> and<00:00:50.090> outs<00:00:50.210> right<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.020> now

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
you a couple in and outs right so now

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.930 
you a couple in and outs right so now
yeah<00:00:51.380> you're<00:00:51.680> trying<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.100> anticipate<00:00:52.520> what's

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
yeah you're trying to anticipate what's

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.760 
yeah you're trying to anticipate what's
going<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:53.870> cross<00:00:54.200> over<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:54.559> way

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
going on and then I cross over this way

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.290 
going on and then I cross over this way
and<00:00:54.950> maybe<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:55.160> come<00:00:55.370> back<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.670> way<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:55.910> pull

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
and maybe I come back this way and pull

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.090 
and maybe I come back this way and pull
back<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:57.320> it's<00:00:57.469> just<00:00:57.559> too<00:00:57.739> much<00:00:57.860> for<00:00:58.010> your

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
back and now it's just too much for your

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.920 
back and now it's just too much for your
brain<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.340> handle<00:00:58.760> your<00:00:59.239> feet<00:00:59.570> your<00:00:59.899> feet

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
brain to handle your feet your feet

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.860 
brain to handle your feet your feet
actually<00:01:00.320> get<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:01.360> later<00:01:02.360> though<00:01:02.570> chance

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
actually get it later though chance

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.450 
actually get it later though chance
that's<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> thing<00:01:03.440> your<00:01:03.860> feet<00:01:04.100> get<00:01:04.250> ahead<00:01:04.399> of

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
that's the thing your feet get ahead of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.020 
that's the thing your feet get ahead of
your<00:01:04.610> mind

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
your mind

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.400 
your mind
and<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.479> it's<00:01:05.630> too<00:01:05.720> much<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.930> handle<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.350> you

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
and so it's too much to handle so you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.600 
and so it's too much to handle so you
end<00:01:06.560> up<00:01:06.590> losing<00:01:06.770> your<00:01:07.009> center<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.280> gravity<00:01:07.580> you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
end up losing your center of gravity you

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.910 
end up losing your center of gravity you
fall<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.119> that's<00:01:08.300> one<00:01:08.450> way<00:01:08.600> okay<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.470> second

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
fall so that's one way okay the second

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.230 
fall so that's one way okay the second
way<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.039> I've<00:01:10.250> noticed<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.610> lot<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.729> times<00:01:11.000> is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
way that I've noticed a lot of times is

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.840 
way that I've noticed a lot of times is
when<00:01:11.420> people<00:01:11.750> give<00:01:12.110> contact<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.009> they<00:01:13.670> knock

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
when people give contact and they knock

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.219 
when people give contact and they knock
the<00:01:13.880> person<00:01:14.270> off<00:01:14.360> balance<00:01:14.690> so<00:01:14.780> if<00:01:14.869> I'm<00:01:14.990> driving

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the person off balance so if I'm driving

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.320 
the person off balance so if I'm driving
to<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.500> rack<00:01:15.710> against<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.789> I<00:01:17.149> just

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
to the rack against you and I just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.600 
to the rack against you and I just
decide<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.710> explode<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.890> way<00:01:19.070> really<00:01:19.310> really

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
decide to explode this way really really

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.279 
decide to explode this way really really
hard<00:01:19.820> right<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.479> go<00:01:20.630> at<00:01:20.750> your<00:01:20.840> shoulder

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
hard right and I go at your shoulder

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.930 
hard right and I go at your shoulder
right<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.890> there's<00:01:22.039> contact<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.759> then<00:01:22.850> I

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
right and there's contact and then I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.449 
right and there's contact and then I
stop<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.560> end<00:01:24.709> up<00:01:24.800> falling<00:01:25.009> it's<00:01:25.280> not<00:01:25.429> a

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
stop if you end up falling it's not a

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.219 
stop if you end up falling it's not a
foul<00:01:25.729> because<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.450> end<00:01:26.539> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.660> day<00:01:26.810> if<00:01:27.050> a

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
foul because the end of the day if a

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.240 
foul because the end of the day if a
defender<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.649> going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.830> stop<00:01:27.979> somebody

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
defender is going to stop somebody

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.680 
defender is going to stop somebody
you're<00:01:28.399> supposed<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.640> chest<00:01:28.970> somebody<00:01:29.300> up<00:01:29.479> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.330 
body I put a lot of contact on them and
I<00:01:38.090> might<00:01:38.240> step<00:01:38.509> back<00:01:38.750> here<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.099> something

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
I might step back here and do something

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.609 
I might step back here and do something
but<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:41.000> fact<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.420> leaned<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.990> them<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
but the fact that I leaned on them and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.010 
but the fact that I leaned on them and
then<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.310> gave<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> quick<00:01:43.789> moment<00:01:44.030> their<00:01:44.810> center

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
then I gave a quick moment their center

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.540 
then I gave a quick moment their center
of<00:01:45.080> gravity<00:01:45.170> was<00:01:45.590> off<00:01:45.740> either<00:01:45.979> off<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.310> push

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
of gravity was off either off the push

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.400 
of gravity was off either off the push
or<00:01:46.789> just<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.330> know<00:01:47.360> two<00:01:47.780> quick<00:01:48.020> movements

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
or just you know two quick movements

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.010

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
okay so go back to the first one

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
particular that you notice work better

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.140 
particular that you notice work better
for<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.209> than<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.540> oh<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.700> hard<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> say<00:02:14.120> I

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
don't really have like a go-to move to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.380 
don't really have like a go-to move to
make<00:02:15.560> some<00:02:15.709> money<00:02:15.830> fall<00:02:16.099> but<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.550> think<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
make some money fall but I think it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.910 
make some money fall but I think it
usually<00:02:17.840> would<00:02:17.930> involve<00:02:18.200> something<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.739> where

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
usually would involve something to where

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.390 
usually would involve something to where
I<00:02:19.330> would<00:02:20.330> give<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.900> out<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.410> would<00:02:22.069> cross

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
I would give in and out I would cross

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.119 
I would give in and out I would cross
you<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.480> step<00:02:23.810> back<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.409> then<00:02:24.950> give

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
you I'm a step back and then give

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.679 
you I'm a step back and then give
another<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.790> out<00:02:25.909> so<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.329> kind<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.540> like

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
another in and out so it's kind of like

playing it by ear you see their hips

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.550 
playing it by ear you see their hips
open<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.569> way<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.470> you're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
open up this way so you know that you're

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.720 
open up this way so you know that you're
gonna<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.709> able<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.890> do<00:02:40.980> something<00:02:41.159> it's<00:02:41.519> tough

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
gonna be able to do something it's tough

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.190 
gonna be able to do something it's tough
to<00:02:41.849> say<00:02:42.000> somebody's<00:02:42.390> playing<00:02:42.569> straight<00:02:43.019> up

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
to say somebody's playing straight up

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
to say somebody's playing straight up
that<00:02:43.709> means<00:02:43.890> they're<00:02:44.099> not<00:02:44.129> really<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.819> over

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that means they're not really like over

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.550 
that means they're not really like over
playing<00:02:45.360> me<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.629> he's<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:45.900> forcing<00:02:46.260> me<00:02:46.319> right

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
playing me and he's not forcing me right

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.479 
playing me and he's not forcing me right
or<00:02:46.709> left<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.129> probably<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> hardest

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
or left so that's probably the hardest

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.190 
or left so that's probably the hardest
way<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:47.970> mix<00:02:48.150> my<00:02:48.329> fault<00:02:48.569> some<00:02:48.720> ways<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.049> plain

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
way to mix my fault some ways just plain

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
way to mix my fault some ways just plain
me<00:02:49.319> straight<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.650> okay<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.459> would<00:02:50.819> have<00:02:50.940> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
me straight up okay so I would have to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.220 
me straight up okay so I would have to
give<00:02:51.209> them<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.450> combo<00:02:51.900> move

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
give them a combo move

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.690 
give them a combo move
usually<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.530> not<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.829> be<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.459> move

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
usually it's not going to be one move

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.920
