00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.620
 what is your role is inaccessible 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.240
 to the world at xiii is stabilizing at the one that the designer 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.119
 as for game designers in June 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.289
 so it's well here are six months that have followed from the student constitute a 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.669
 team and I'm all lime to the end 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.619
 what are the origins of sports 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.019
 what are your personal references 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.380
 what games or toys games books when you were in France 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 still this ong put all kinds of two games and toys I always 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.669
 been very interested in science this sport is very inspired in my 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.070
 impression that time the civilizations 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.990
 the singer is quite rare 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.230
 we know what will happen to look at the world as a result of different points 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.880
 of view 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.170
 my money - if we attend finally me big loan 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.340
 all hopes prehistory and science fiction 7% 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.490
 had also given the players she's contributing immensely by creating 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.150
 hotspots it's really amazing all this is a source 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.400
 inspiration 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 can you describe the evolution of the project then 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.820
 have you imagined the game in its final version for ages of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.850
 major changes are sedentary or under development when traveling the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.230
 most essential is a man of his word 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.540
 montpellier in january rights more things than i can well this 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.900
 that I originally thought 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.710
 in fact we started to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.920
 it takes 9% to make music accompaniment in addition to that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 I did not think to do it more 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.140
 the world with publishers also in this report have thought of everything 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.870
 those who might have them a little less officials 12:30 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.570
 they are frustrated actually we were the roads the meeting of those we 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 expected departure 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.020
 how do you imagine this for two years 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.190
 in five years 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.250
 have you thought of other developments 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.840
 but that's because it's the sign that these purchases are not the players 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.899
 are not so high 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.969
 it is also a good opportunity 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.329
 emilie who created things had made themselves a hell of a train and it's a 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.260
 little as if we too have made a death 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.060
 the ram players will continue to create things we can talk about 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.580
 predict at this point they were obviously it's a source 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.550
 of inspiration we are very important and what we do 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.419
 the echo of this cinema 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.999
 the senate gave two passes it even seems that for a reason and a 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.209
 extension 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.319
 - the rusal title are so for september 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.299
 their contribution 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.389
 what do you think of the content created by the players 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
 Will this trend be the future of the video game 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.489
 after i think that lille content created by the the player it's really 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.849
 a way to get to a strong one end in itself it's about creating a 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.949
 community 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.859
 and they keep in budgetary balance a thesis also the 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.609
 causes players to create their own job creations for the 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:42.230
 last month 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.240
 saadane it's this cup originally morning a very particular attachment 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.520
 of his players whose need for a playmaker pellet entirely in 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.919
 personal effect of the greedy pagger's hut 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.729
 rt 2012 is having a social network on the departments of the region of 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.329
 Mont-Joli 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.869
 to say that sport is a mmo 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.239
 we expect sport is not too much to my taste 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.400
 we do not play with which of the two players in real time success it's 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.719
 because the relief stops their social reasons they will play with 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.790
 hack to hack creatures from ps gilles vehicles from other players 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.840
 juhasz it's like they have to go through the catalog of an exhibition 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.949
 of arms to the neighboring angola who did that 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.299
 the more we are actually quite 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.189
 m the young player at sancourt a pleasant seizure men do not have to be 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.769
 online at the same time also we do not have to pay a monthly subscription
