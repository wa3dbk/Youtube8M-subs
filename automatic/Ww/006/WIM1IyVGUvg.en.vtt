00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.639 
certainly isn't doing that I think it's
the<00:00:26.009> best<00:00:26.700> way<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.419> a<00:00:27.509> hundred<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
the best way to do it in a hundred if a

Lewis become the first man to stop well
I<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.620> say<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.160> it's<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:36.030> far

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
I think you have to say that it's so far

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
I think you have to say that it's so far
not<00:04:36.540> much<00:04:36.570> more<00:04:37.080> than<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.100> gym<00:04:38.370> workout<00:04:39.320> so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
not much more than a gym workout so

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.170 
not much more than a gym workout so
Lewis<00:04:40.590> but<00:04:40.920> he's<00:04:41.040> starting<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.490> crash<00:04:41.910> homes

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.550
