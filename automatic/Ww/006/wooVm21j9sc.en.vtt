00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
representation of one over seven its of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.179 
representation of one over seven its of
these<00:00:27.570> six<00:00:27.930> numbers<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.619> keep<00:00:28.859> repeating

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
these six numbers which keep repeating

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.120 
these six numbers which keep repeating
over<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> over<00:00:30.210> again<00:00:30.560> one<00:00:31.560> four<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.099> eight

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
five seven to get two over seven you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
five seven to get two over seven you
look<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> second<00:00:37.860> largest<00:00:38.160> number<00:00:38.460> which

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
look for the second largest number which

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.619 
look for the second largest number which
is<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:41.629> have<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> cards<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> same<00:00:43.890> order

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
is to have the cards in the same order

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.700 
is to have the cards in the same order
starting<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:47.149> then<00:00:48.149> rearrange

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
starting with the two and then rearrange

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
starting with the two and then rearrange
the<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:49.920> cards<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> four<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.809> end

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the other cards one and four to the end

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.880 
the other cards one and four to the end
and<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:53.640> give<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.030> 2<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.690> 7<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and this will give you 2 over 7 which is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
and this will give you 2 over 7 which is
2<00:00:56.579> 8<00:00:56.879> 5<00:00:57.480> 7<00:00:58.050> 1<00:00:58.199> 4<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.570> it<00:01:00.570> keeps<00:01:00.809> repeating<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
2 8 5 7 1 4 and it keeps repeating in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.850 
2 8 5 7 1 4 and it keeps repeating in
that<00:01:01.739> order<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> 3<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:06.840> 7<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.619> look

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that order to get to 3 over 7 you look

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
that order to get to 3 over 7 you look
for<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> third<00:01:08.520> largest<00:01:08.790> number<00:01:09.420> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.110> 4

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
for the third largest number which is 4

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
for the third largest number which is 4
and<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> number<00:01:13.170> 4<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.310> start<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:17.479> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and we want the number 4 to start out so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.870 
and we want the number 4 to start out so
we<00:01:18.600> put<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> number<00:01:19.229> four<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> beginning

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
we put the number four at the beginning

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
we put the number four at the beginning
keep<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> rest<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> cards<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> same

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
keep the rest of the cards in the same

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.140 
keep the rest of the cards in the same
order<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.640> decimal

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
order and this will be the decimal

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
order and this will be the decimal
representation<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:28.400> 3<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.759> 7<00:01:29.990> which<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.020> 0.42

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
representation of 3 over 7 which is 0.42

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.200 
representation of 3 over 7 which is 0.42
8<00:01:32.460> 5<00:01:32.880> 7<00:01:33.240> 1<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.579> then<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> numbers<00:01:36.000> keep

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
8 5 7 1 and then the numbers keep

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.440 
8 5 7 1 and then the numbers keep
repeating<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> order<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> 4<00:01:39.180> over

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
repeating in that order to get to 4 over

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
repeating in that order to get to 4 over
7<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.990> look<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> fourth<00:01:40.799> largest<00:01:41.040> number

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
7 we look for the fourth largest number

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
7 we look for the fourth largest number
which<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> 5<00:01:44.299> we<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.320> list<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.740> numbers

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
which is 5 we make the list of numbers

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
which is 5 we make the list of numbers
start<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.549> 5<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.890> then<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.700> rearrange<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
start with 5 and then we rearrange the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.960 
start with 5 and then we rearrange the
rest<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> cards<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.040> end

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
rest of the cards at the end

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.220 
rest of the cards at the end
so<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.690> is<00:01:55.870> 4<00:01:56.170> over<00:01:56.350> 7<00:01:56.710> which<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.280> 5<00:01:57.700> 7<00:01:58.240> 1<00:01:58.450> 4<00:01:58.990> 2<00:01:59.200> 8

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
so this is 4 over 7 which is 5 7 1 4 2 8

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.980 
so this is 4 over 7 which is 5 7 1 4 2 8
and<00:01:59.730> the<00:02:00.730> numbers<00:02:01.030> keep<00:02:01.240> repeating<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.840> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and the numbers keep repeating in that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:12.540 
and the numbers keep repeating in that
order<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:07.540> continue<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.610> get<00:02:09.760> 5<00:02:10.030> over<00:02:10.420> 7<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
order we continue to get 5 over 7 it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.480 
order we continue to get 5 over 7 it
starts<00:02:12.880> out<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.210> sudden<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:13.900> 7<00:02:14.470> 1<00:02:14.950> 4<00:02:15.220> 2

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
starts out with the sudden we go 7 1 4 2

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.570 
starts out with the sudden we go 7 1 4 2
8<00:02:15.520> 5<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.320> numbers<00:02:17.650> will<00:02:17.830> repeat<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.400> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
8 5 and the numbers will repeat in that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.830 
8 5 and the numbers will repeat in that
order<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.410> finally<00:02:20.410> we<00:02:21.280> get<00:02:21.460> 6<00:02:21.940> over<00:02:22.300> 7<00:02:22.480> which

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
order and finally we get 6 over 7 which

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.820 
order and finally we get 6 over 7 which
starts<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> largest<00:02:24.610> number<00:02:24.880> 8<00:02:25.830> we

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
starts out with the largest number 8 we

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.160 
starts out with the largest number 8 we
move<00:02:27.070> those<00:02:27.580> cards<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.240> beginning<00:02:28.660> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.690 

append<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.320> remaining<00:02:32.800> cards<00:02:33.070> at<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.220> end<00:02:33.340> in

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
append the remaining cards at the end in

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.300 
append the remaining cards at the end in
the<00:02:34.090> same<00:02:34.330> order<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:34.890> 6<00:02:35.890> over<00:02:36.190> 7<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.810> 8<00:02:37.810> 5<00:02:38.200> 7<00:02:38.680> 1<00:02:38.830> 4

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
the same order so 6 over 7 is 8 5 7 1 4

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.700 
the same order so 6 over 7 is 8 5 7 1 4
2<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.570> numbers<00:02:40.870> keep<00:02:41.080> repeating<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
2 and the numbers keep repeating in that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
5 7 you can always get all the decimals

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.700 
5 7 you can always get all the decimals
of<00:02:50.410> 7<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.910> start<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.300> over<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.870> start

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
of 7 and to start all over just start

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.030 
of 7 and to start all over just start
with<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> ACE<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:56.290> brings<00:02:56.530> us<00:02:56.680> back<00:02:56.710> to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
with the ACE and this brings us back to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.880 
with the ACE and this brings us back to
1<00:02:57.190> over<00:02:57.460> 7<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:57.970> 1<00:02:58.300> 4<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.750> 8<00:02:58.930> 5<00:02:59.170> 7<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.770> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
1 over 7 which is 1 4 to 8 5 7 and the

1 over 7 which is 1 4 to 8 5 7 and the
