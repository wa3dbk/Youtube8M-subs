00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.190 
only using one two three four five and
that's<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.549> that's<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.970> only<00:03:40.359> points<00:03:41.049> are

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that's it that's the only points are

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.240 
that's it that's the only points are
using<00:03:41.560> point<00:03:41.890> one<00:03:42.549> two<00:03:42.879> three<00:03:42.909> four<00:03:43.540> five<00:03:45.930> six

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
using point one two three four five six

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.330 
using point one two three four five six
so<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:48.549> are<00:03:48.790> used<00:03:49.060> only<00:03:49.209> six<00:03:49.750> points<00:03:50.079> now<00:03:51.069> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
so we are used only six points now to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.240 
so we are used only six points now to
make<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.670> track<00:03:54.329> which<00:03:55.329> is<00:03:55.650> out<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.709> mine

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
make this track which is out of mine

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.610 
make this track which is out of mine
seven<00:03:57.879> points<00:03:58.120> which<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:59.310> which<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:01.470> am<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
seven points which I have which I am the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.449 
seven points which I have which I am the
ab<00:04:02.739> seven<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.139> pretty<00:04:05.470> complicated<00:04:05.919> but

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
ab seven so it is pretty complicated but

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.659 
ab seven so it is pretty complicated but
not<00:04:06.909> many<00:04:07.150> points
