like<00:02:00.750> cutting<00:02:00.990> washer<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.180> here

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
like cutting washer you see right here

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.570 
like cutting washer you see right here
make<00:02:04.500> sure<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.040> off<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.340> side
