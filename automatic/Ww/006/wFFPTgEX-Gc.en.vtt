pattern correctly what I've gotten what

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.420 
pattern correctly what I've gotten what
I've<00:01:47.090> what<00:01:47.420> works<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.750> me<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.710> start<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.280> an

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
I've what works for me is I start on an

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.749 
I've what works for me is I start on an
upstroke<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:53.140> then<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.170> am<00:01:54.560> UN<00:01:55.399> and

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
upstroke so I'm and then I am UN and

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:07.749 
upstroke so I'm and then I am UN and
play<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.210> dynamic<00:01:57.140> there<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.550> see<00:02:07.729> I

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
play that dynamic there so you see I

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:38.470 
play that dynamic there so you see I
start<00:02:34.540> good<00:02:35.540> luck<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.560> pretty<00:02:36.830> simple<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
start good luck it's pretty simple you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.819 
start good luck it's pretty simple you
have<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.630> thumbs<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.049> if<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.320> learn<00:02:39.530> something
