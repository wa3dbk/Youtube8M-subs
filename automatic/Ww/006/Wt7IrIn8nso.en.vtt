00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello today let's see the 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.730
 king the king and a very nice effect that 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.349
 you can play harmonica 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.440
 in blues I 'm doing a little 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 demonstration a little air of blues with 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.070
 the wow effect 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:39.060
 so here is the huawei are nice 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.560
 So how does it work 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.410
 what's the trick what's the secret good 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.300
 Well actually all fits in 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.670
 position you have of the harmonica 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 in your hands you now know 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 how to hold the harmonica in your mouth 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.580
 by tilting like those not 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.010
 necessarily 45 degrees but at least 30 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.050
 degrees anyway well in the mouth 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.520
 if you still have doubts about the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.650
 holding the harmonica in the mouth 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.950
 you can review the course on 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.450
 the mouthpiece well this time I'm going 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.780
 tell you about the imposition of 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.980
 the harmonica in the hands so for 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.870
 get the wow effect 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.150
 the hands must form a kind 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.400
 of hull imagine a hull of boat 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.990
 for example it's a bit the shape that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.300
 hands must have to hold 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.370
 the harmonica and produce the wow effect 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.480
 so I show you how we do with 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.230
 hands first without the harmonica 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 here is my right hand 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.350
 I specify that the southern wathier then at the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.690
 base of the fingers I'm not talking about 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 chick at the base of others must you 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 have a rounded lines of course well 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.590
 spotted well this line as it goes 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 we serve to hold the harmonica 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 to form an era 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.590
 now here is my left hand so what 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.640
 that I had spotted on the left hand 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 it's the slice of the hand ie 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 right here 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.300
 so what I'm going to do is I 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.580
 will put the slice of the left hand 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.180
 on the basis of the fingers of the right hand 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.890
 so I recap the slice of the hand 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.940
 left 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:32.140
 here on the basis of the fingers of the hand 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:36.940
 right here like this I'm doing it again 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.900
 full motion left hand slice of 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.540
 left hand right hand base of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.700
 fingers of the right hand slice of the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.910
 left hand on the base of the fingers of the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.910
 right hand 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:58.030
 the palms gets closer fingers 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.440
 continued the uqo and the fork of the thumb of 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.910
 the left hand comes to seize the harmonica 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.319
 go I make you move again 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.980
 once but this time with 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.810
 harmonica 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.329
 I hold the harmonica of my left hand 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.639
 I remember that I am right handed I 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.769
 so here in the fork that is created 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:19.060
 between the thumb and forefinger of the hand 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.359
 left like this I'm careful 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.859
 that slice of the left hand 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.930
 coincides with the base and finger of the 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.769
 right hand 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.220
 topi then I bring the palms closer 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:37.690
 then I re more fingers and I close 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 this hull with the thumbs so the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.810
 shell is well hermetic demonstration 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.269
 the sound is much softer than 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.269
 when I'm like that's so 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.650
 the device on the wawa what am I doing 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:01.060
 it's just opening the palms 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.419
 so I can answer like this or 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.919
 a little more by opening a little fingers 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:11.400
 the idea is to go from one are muffled 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.400
 a clear sound 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:20.720
 demonstration so if you press well 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.199
 sure the palms firmly and that of a 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.639
 single shot you spread your palms 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.010
 possibly the fingers well you 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.580
 suddenly pass from one are choked a 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:38.720
 its clear what gives it are months - 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:41.690
 month at a pinch you could do the 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.630
 same thing without the harmonica for example 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.550
 said or very loudly in the hands with the 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.380
 same position then opens the hands 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.490
 abruptly you and hear them a 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:03.740
 pretend of wawa also demonstration 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:06.260
 where I say it by heavy or not I do not 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.180
 know what it's really hands that 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.120
 do this case since I'm moving from one 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.160
 are closed we understand without providing 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.810
 a father 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.970
 the sound is clear in any case a lot 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.970
 the clearer we will be the clear sound and 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.190
 and 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.030
 and 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.030
 yes ok again with the harmonica 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.000
 so so wawa effect works well 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.340
 in the bass more than in the treble 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.760
 since as you hold the harmonica 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.670
 like this with the bass left 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:53.750
 of course the wawa worked well 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:06:01.520
 with the bass so blowing in 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:05.990
 the 1 by sucking in the bath 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:12.370
 blowing in two years does not inspire man 2 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:18.250
 and we blow in 3 and 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.669
 we aspire to the same thing in the 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.669
 by blowing 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:30.430
 it's already a little frailer we aspire 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:32.200
 to the world 4 ok go one last small 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.350
 phrase or blues with the novels alright 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.350
 sure 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.689
 hu 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.569
 m
