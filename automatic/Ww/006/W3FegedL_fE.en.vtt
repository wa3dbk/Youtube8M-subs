00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.830 

just<00:02:13.720> stow<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> prusik<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:15.090> took<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.360> loop

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
just stow the prusik I took a loop

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:29.440 
just stow the prusik I took a loop
through<00:02:17.110> my<00:02:17.260> waist<00:02:17.440> belt
