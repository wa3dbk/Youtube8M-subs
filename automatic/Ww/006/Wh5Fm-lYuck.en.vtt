00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
figure out and replicate it and this is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.740

try<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:11.899> do<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.380> my<00:01:12.410> first<00:01:12.710> try<00:01:13.039> so<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:13.880> go

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
try to do this on my first try so you go

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.770 
try to do this on my first try so you go
into<00:01:14.539> rampage<00:01:15.289> mode<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.910> grab<00:01:20.119> your<00:01:20.300> vehicle

into rampage mode and grab your vehicle
and<00:01:22.179> if<00:01:23.179> successful<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:25.869> shouldn't<00:01:26.869> be

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
and if successful you shouldn't be

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.479 
and if successful you shouldn't be
taking<00:01:27.259> any<00:01:27.380> damage<00:01:27.590> whatsoever<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.340> your

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:28.489 
taking any damage whatsoever on your

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.120 
taking any damage whatsoever on your
vehicle

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.060 

and<00:01:31.670> I'll<00:01:32.090> hop<00:01:32.540> back<00:01:32.780> out<00:01:33.020> here<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.470> enemies

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
and I'll hop back out here and enemies

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
and I'll hop back out here and enemies
are<00:01:37.100> attacking<00:01:38.060> me

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.650 

now<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> only<00:01:47.100> downside<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.330> fast

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
now the only downside is is if you fast

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.680 
now the only downside is is if you fast
travel<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.530> another<00:01:49.800> place<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.120> not<00:01:51.480> be

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
travel to another place you will not be

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.190 
travel to another place you will not be
able<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.430> still<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.730> glitch<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
able to still have this glitch so it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.220 
able to still have this glitch so it
only<00:01:55.350> works<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.430> per<00:01:56.700> area<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.080> are

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
only works on one per area so if you are

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.390 
only works on one per area so if you are
fighting<00:01:58.680> an<00:01:58.830> invincible<00:01:59.460> boss<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:01.740> best<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
fighting an invincible boss it's best to

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.530 
fighting an invincible boss it's best to
use<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.000> don't<00:02:03.120> think<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
use that but you don't think you can

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.180 
use that but you don't think you can
really<00:02:03.870> do<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.170> some<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.010> invincible

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
really do it in some of the invincible

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.130 
really do it in some of the invincible
bosses<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.510> have<00:02:06.570> vehicles

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
bosses because they don't have vehicles

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.980 
bosses because they don't have vehicles
but<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.460> try<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:08.970> other<00:02:09.149> ways<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.899> if

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
but I will try some other ways to see if

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.430 
but I will try some other ways to see if
I<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> glitch<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.040> work<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:12.510> other

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I can get this glitch to work on other

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.650 
I can get this glitch to work on other
things<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.250> hopefully<00:02:15.060> I'll<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.420> able<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
things and hopefully I'll be able to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.860 
things and hopefully I'll be able to
find<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.580> yeah<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> best<00:02:18.690> way

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
find out but yeah this is the best way

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
find out but yeah this is the best way
to<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.490> I'll<00:02:20.580> keep
