and that includes the mag backs
themselves<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.439> we'll<00:00:22.830> talk<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.279> what

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
themselves which we'll talk about what

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
themselves which we'll talk about what
these<00:00:23.730> are<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> second

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
these are for in a second

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
these are for in a second
you<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.340> 3m<00:00:26.730> primer<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.689> some

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you get some 3m primer you get some

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.250 
you get some 3m primer you get some
alcohol<00:00:28.080> pads<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> template<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> then

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
alcohol pads you get a template and then

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
alcohol pads you get a template and then
on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> back<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.640> mag

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
on the back here are the two mag

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.200 
on the back here are the two mag
magnetic<00:00:34.200> mounting<00:00:34.530> strips<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
magnetic mounting strips that you get so

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.580 
magnetic mounting strips that you get so
basically<00:00:36.570> let's<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
basically let's get all this out of the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.430 
basically let's get all this out of the
way<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.489> talk<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.899> template

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
way first and talk about the template

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.639 
way first and talk about the template
and<00:00:41.090> basically<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and basically what you do with this is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.630 
and basically what you do with this is
you<00:00:44.090> unfold<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:46.469> slide<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.309> your

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you unfold it and you slide it over your

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.510 
you unfold it and you slide it over your
iPad<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.649> I<00:00:49.649> won't<00:00:49.890> fail<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.280> now

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
iPad and I won't fail to do it now

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.650 
iPad and I won't fail to do it now
because<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.789> already<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.239> installed

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
because I already have these installed

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
because I already have these installed
but<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.230> slide<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.649> down<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but you slide it down so it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
but you slide it down so it's
essentially<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> line<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
essentially like this and line up the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
essentially like this and line up the
Apple<00:00:55.530> logo<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.059> two

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
Apple logo and then you take these two

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
Apple logo and then you take these two
strips<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.620> showed<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> beginning

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
strips just showed you in the beginning

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.389 
strips just showed you in the beginning
and<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.780> stick<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.620> using<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and you stick them on using that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
and you stick them on using that
template<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.809> 3m<00:01:04.409> adhesive<00:01:04.739> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
template and they have 3m adhesive on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
template and they have 3m adhesive on
the<00:01:05.129> back<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.150> line<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the back so you line it up and you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
the back so you line it up and you
adhere<00:01:07.500> these<00:01:07.950> things<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.090> magnetic

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
adhere these things which have magnetic

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
adhere these things which have magnetic
properties<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> your

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
properties to them to the back of your

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
properties to them to the back of your
iPad<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.810> once<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.320> place

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
iPad like so and then once are in place

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
iPad like so and then once are in place
it<00:01:14.310> looks<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> are

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it looks like this and what you have are

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
it looks like this and what you have are
these<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.799> silicone<00:01:17.580> pads<00:01:18.270> stuck<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
these two silicone pads stuck to the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
these two silicone pads stuck to the
back<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.860> ID<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> couple

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
back your ID now these do a couple

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
back your ID now these do a couple
things<00:01:21.659> first<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.170> they're<00:01:22.350> very<00:01:22.380> grippy

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
things first of all they're very grippy

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
things first of all they're very grippy
so<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.520> feel<00:01:23.790> good<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.240> holding<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so they feel good when you're holding it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.060 
so they feel good when you're holding it
even<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.229> holding<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.710> iPad

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
even when you're just holding your iPad

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.030 
even when you're just holding your iPad
naked<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.939> adds<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> extra<00:01:27.479> functionality

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
naked it adds that extra functionality

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.230 
naked it adds that extra functionality
but<00:01:29.040> what's<00:01:29.280> cool<00:01:29.520> about<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
but what's cool about these is the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
but what's cool about these is the
magnetic<00:01:30.570> properties<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> that's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
magnetic properties of them and that's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
magnetic properties of them and that's
what<00:01:32.579> allows<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.420> work<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.710> strips

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
what allows them to work with the strips

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.840 
what allows them to work with the strips
and<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:36.180> magnetic<00:01:36.689> strips<00:01:37.460> are<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.640> guys

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and the magnetic strips are these guys

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
and the magnetic strips are these guys
right<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.049> two<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right here and you get two of them in a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
right here and you get two of them in a
pack<00:01:41.070> they're<00:01:41.790> stuck<00:01:42.090> together<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
pack they're stuck together and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
pack they're stuck together and
basically<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.950> stick<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.659> your

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
basically you stick them on to your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
basically you stick them on to your
surface<00:01:46.020> where<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> mount<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
surface where you want to mount this now

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789 
surface where you want to mount this now
if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> magnetic<00:01:49.020> surface<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.649> won't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
if you have a magnetic surface you won't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
if you have a magnetic surface you won't
need<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.360> non<00:01:51.600> metal

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
need these but if it's a non metal

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
need these but if it's a non metal
surface<00:01:52.500> you'll<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> mount<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> like

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
surface you'll need to mount this like

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
surface you'll need to mount this like
on<00:01:53.759> drywall<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.450> anything<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
on drywall or anything like that and you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
on drywall or anything like that and you
do<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> mount<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.049> magnets

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
do have to mount it with the magnets

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.649 
do have to mount it with the magnets
pointing<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> angled<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.420> but

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
pointing down so kind of angled down but

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.569 
pointing down so kind of angled down but
what's<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.990> once<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.799> place<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
what's this once this is in place it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
what's this once this is in place it
becomes<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> bracket<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> these<00:02:03.899> things

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
becomes the bracket that these things

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.469 
becomes the bracket that these things
stick<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.189> when<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
stick to you can see when I put it on it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
stick to you can see when I put it on it
just<00:02:06.509> sticks<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.979> allows

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
just sticks there and that's what allows

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.490 
just sticks there and that's what allows
it<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.060> mount<00:02:09.300> super<00:02:09.840> strong

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it to mount super strong

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
it to mount super strong
okay<00:02:11.009> very<00:02:11.220> strong<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.910> you'll<00:02:12.360> clean<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
okay very strong so you'll clean the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
okay very strong so you'll clean the
surface<00:02:13.349> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
surface with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740 
surface with
paths<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:14.310> give<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.670> you'll<00:02:15.150> prime<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.660> with

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
paths they give you you'll prime it with

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.030 
paths they give you you'll prime it with
that<00:02:15.840> little<00:02:15.960> primer<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.650> you'll<00:02:16.800> stick

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that little primer and then you'll stick

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400 
that little primer and then you'll stick
this<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.850> you'll<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.270> able<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.600> mount<00:02:18.870> your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this on and you'll be able to mount your

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.920 
this on and you'll be able to mount your
iPad<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.520> let's<00:02:20.760> take<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> look<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> iPad

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
iPad so let's take a look at the iPad

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.380 
iPad so let's take a look at the iPad
and<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> mag<00:02:23.160> back<00:02:23.400> mounted<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.120> couple

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and the mag back mounted in a couple

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.470 
and the mag back mounted in a couple
different<00:02:24.660> scenarios<00:02:25.850> all<00:02:26.850> right<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.210> let's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
different scenarios all right so let's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.750 
different scenarios all right so let's
say<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.690> want<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.990> mount<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.500> mag<00:02:29.040> back<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
say you want to mount the mag back to a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240 
say you want to mount the mag back to a
place<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.690> isn't<00:02:30.840> metal<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.530> that's<00:02:31.980> where

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
place that isn't metal and that's where

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.520 
place that isn't metal and that's where
these<00:02:32.430> metal<00:02:32.880> strips<00:02:33.030> come<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:33.630> place<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
these metal strips come into place so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.200 
these metal strips come into place so
it's<00:02:34.890> hard<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> focus<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.880> because<00:02:36.000> of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
it's hard to focus on that because of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's hard to focus on that because of
all<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.480> weight<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.930> basically<00:02:37.610> using<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
all the weight but basically using the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.210 
all the weight but basically using the
tools<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.630> showed<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.110> previously<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
tools I showed you previously in the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.150 
tools I showed you previously in the
intro<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.820> clean<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> surface<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.560> prime<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
intro you clean the surface you prime it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.070 
intro you clean the surface you prime it
and<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.550> stick<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.060> metal<00:02:45.450> strip<00:02:45.810> on

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and then you stick that metal strip on

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then you stick that metal strip on
and<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.620> basically<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.480> magnetic<00:02:48.480> bar<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and that is basically a magnetic bar you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.780 
and that is basically a magnetic bar you
can<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.830> there<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.280> angled

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
can see it there and it's angled

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
can see it there and it's angled
downward<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.570> when<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.320> ready<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.680> use<00:02:52.890> it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
downward and when you're ready to use it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.300 
downward and when you're ready to use it
simply<00:02:53.700> take<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.270> iPad<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.980> line<00:02:56.280> up

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
simply take your iPad and you line up

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.500 
simply take your iPad and you line up
the<00:02:57.380> magnetic<00:02:58.380> grippy<00:02:59.310> things<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.270> back

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the magnetic grippy things on the back

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.060 
the magnetic grippy things on the back
and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.650> pop<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.410> your

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
and then just pop it on like so and your

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.850 
and then just pop it on like so and your
iPad<00:03:05.580> will<00:03:05.850> magnetically<00:03:06.290> adhere<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
iPad will magnetically adhere to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.190 
iPad will magnetically adhere to
whatever<00:03:08.070> surface<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.970> metal<00:03:09.510> strip<00:03:09.959> has

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
whatever surface that metal strip has

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.260 
whatever surface that metal strip has
been<00:03:10.410> stuck<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.910> place<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
been stuck to and you can place that

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.060 
been stuck to and you can place that
thing<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.720> about<00:03:12.840> anywhere<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.590> then

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
thing just about anywhere and then

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.820 
thing just about anywhere and then
basically<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.940> free<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.330> use<00:03:15.380> your<00:03:16.380> iPad

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
basically you are free to use your iPad

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.190 
basically you are free to use your iPad
just<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.459> normally<00:03:17.670> would<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.510> it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
just as you normally would and it's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.020 
just as you normally would and it's
super<00:03:19.590> secure<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.880> definitely

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
super secure you know it's definitely

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.940 
super secure you know it's definitely
stuck<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:21.750> there<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.230> going<00:03:22.560> anywhere

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
stuck on there it's not going anywhere

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.940 
stuck on there it's not going anywhere
which<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.459> pretty<00:03:23.640> cool<00:03:24.530> alright<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:25.709> let's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
which is pretty cool alright so let's

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.650 
which is pretty cool alright so let's
say<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> surface<00:03:26.820> that's<00:03:27.180> metal<00:03:27.390> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
say you have a surface that's metal and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.420 
say you have a surface that's metal and
you<00:03:27.720> want<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.989> mount<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.410> iPad<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.250> like

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
you want to mount your iPad to it like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.400 
you want to mount your iPad to it like
my<00:03:29.610> fridge<00:03:30.000> well<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.080> don't<00:03:31.290> really

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
my fridge well then you don't really

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.110 
my fridge well then you don't really
even<00:03:31.590> need<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.920> use<00:03:32.100> those<00:03:32.340> magnetic<00:03:32.700> strips

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
even need to use those magnetic strips
