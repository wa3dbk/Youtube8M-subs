00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.520
 in the year 2006 honda launched the eighth generation of the civic and all 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.480
 they are amazed with their daring design it was like a spaceship with 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.629
 ropes 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.550
 the good thing is that the futuristic line the exterior has continuity and in the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.839
 inside 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.349
 the information is divided into three screens 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.959
 and extrusion some controls is at least questionable curious 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.620
 on the other hand the quality of the materials and the adjustment of them 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.800
 of the best in its category 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.830
 another thing that I find propose this car are the rear seats the gap 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.640
 for the legs is tremendous is greater than that of a passat 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.850
 However, the space available for the head is insufficient for people 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 that is more than one meter seventy and they like to go wounded 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.940
 where there is no complaint is the trunk 485 liters 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.360
 it's huge 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 It has a double bottom and the backs are folding 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 but without a doubt what struck me most was the possibility of folding 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 the rear bench 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.080
 surely many of you already know 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.000
 the miranda state 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.920
 you understand me full 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.990
 is currently 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.130
 in 2009 the Romanian striker 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 but taking into account that the modifications will not affect the section 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.490
 mechanic 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.320
 all models of canned Fernandez lamentable death is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.450
 they will sell with her 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600
 ccoo 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.090
 that's true is that the laser scanner 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 there are no significant differences between the 2006 model and the 2009 model 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.780
 Same expressions same engines and of course same defects 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.270
 like the houses rear visibility 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 my problem that is accentuated on rainy days 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.209
 the unit in question is powered by a gasoline engine with four 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.219
 cylinders that produces 140 horsepower maximum 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.769
 associated with a six-speed manual gear I get a good relationship 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.189
 between benefits and consumption 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.939
 the civic 1 point 8 can perform 0 to 100 in eight as 9 seconds 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.419
 and reach a maximum speed of 205 kilometers per hour 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.669
 the official average consumption was placed in the 6 ethyl commas every 100 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.689
 kilometer 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.989
 the world come and very soft and nice 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.939
 it will not be faster more large consumption will be between 100 3 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.029
 points less well 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.009
 but motors in venezuela decreased 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.339
 it responds well 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 and it is not necessary to constantly resort annan 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.799
 the chassis can not say bad things and what you're looking for is a vehicle 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.009
 that has a certain sporting character and that is cheerful with 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.040
 the poor performance in management is actually no less components 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.539
 dyn a great lateral grip 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.849
 and responds with great agility of support changes 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.419
 in this round of a grand slam and lion in 2009 went up 1 now well 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.349
 that facility to take the curves that your counterpart on the fast lanes 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.310
 the civic is not an especially comfortable car and also that the sound level of 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.559
 it is above the usual its part 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.559
 admonished aranda m 90 + 1 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.199
 - the sardine long trips in a manual 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.059
 best script for a minor 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.689
 the price is five doors part of the 18 thousand 300 euros 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.239
 estonia in particular with the engine 1 point 8 of 140 horses 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.879
 he does it from 22 thousand 200 euros 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.980
 with the authorizations 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.449
 2009 series equipment includes elements such as light and rain sensor 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.749
 besides curtain 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.310
 Stability control 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.090
 cruise control 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.789
 17-inch wheels and if that rear parking 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:09.720
 the system 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 Venezuelan plains do not come with 40 horses 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.459
 ----- ---- ---- 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.270
 It costs two thousand euros more 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.409
 received his reward in case the many music lovers win 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.639
 The Honda Civic is a very complete car 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.810
 attractive well spacious world well equipped 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.600
 his biggest problem is in an increasingly tough competition where 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.270
 models like the ford focus qwerty 34 are more modern alternatives equally 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.449
 valid 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.590
 of course man is not unaware of this fact and the ninth generation of 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.319
 civilized 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.710
 in 2012 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.330
 the question is will surprise again
