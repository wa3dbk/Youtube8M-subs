00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 even though he looks so small and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.030
 do not think it is just next door 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.200
 largest rail yard of europe the am 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 hamburg massa station is visible 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.770
 infinitely more travel with the same 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.460
 building in between trains and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 locomotives but that half of the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 coffin the other side again just like that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 big the water looks like one 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.770
 fan is called a track of oats or 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 the direction city'll be the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.470
 whole train station is over seven kilometers 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.649
 long 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.480
 and what happens now on his office there 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.219
 a locomotive is the culprit many 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 freight wagons from all nations countries the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.080
 from here in different directions 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.240
 we have ours before the train stops 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.930
 rinke this train already electronically 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.060
 be right 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.660
 he knows what dare turn are what everyone 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.230
 choice moves and where every dare should go 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.020
 finished relatively long list 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.860
 what is the locomotive driver doing? 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 locomotive off 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 fakt make the professional office guests to cover 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.050
 after each and the better off with it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.720
 but also contrary 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.390
 and this cell-mate arrives here 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 there is books waiting where to go 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 the very flattened book means so much bigger 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.340
 he does not throw that list all over 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.340
 train then left the curb so that the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.110
 Legs are unbraked after climbing 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.049
 list between the wagons 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 Prevent a departure of several depending on 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.560
 The plans are firm after air 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 Finally, valves loosen the screws 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.200
 Clutch and wave 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.799
 the first time he left the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 Whole access that dogs for one 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.260
 kilometer turns on that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990
 same releases the brakes and hangs the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.290
 Dare off when done it settles 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.000
 behind the train a so-called 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.500
 shift lures you 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.009
 and slowly pulls the train to a drain 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 mountain 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.960
 that made out what is an expiration 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.900
 berg I listened to the hand on the side of the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.370
 pushed and because the cars of the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.240
 End users run on the system and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.550
 even under 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.280
 but where do they run into? 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.380
 direction track worth circle harbor always 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.820
 the gen to punish in and after 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.190
 Denmark or Sweden or wherever 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.840
 always that the horizontal tracks and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.240
 ensures the completely switched off 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.670
 reach exactly after the cell is a 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.680
 the beginning and supervised by the mountain massa 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.030
 and how are you now with you can see that 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.430
 They were in different directions 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.840
 go to a timelapse otherwise 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.000
 that would have taken too long 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.370
 So when , for example, he emma 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.650
 A glass of a car can come to the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.870
 Port come come differently and so on 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 and so on 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.110
 Of course, that does not happen so fast 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.290
 But the whole train will be over the drain 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.290
 Berg pushed all the way to the last gong 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.280
 and the possibility with it the balance 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.850
 not in too fast 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.270
 the same direction went there 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.370
 act from right and left on the carrier 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.800
 the badenheimer does not slow down so much 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.710
 be equal to the English the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.300
 abroad until they hit the calves 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.540
 which also be in the direction 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.660
 and if he is not a whole sharp 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.240
 understand 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.970
 daniel directly to the offender on the wire 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.330
 be through from below against the wheels 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.880
 and push the whole train together and 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.250
 when then all generations write 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.250
 each other are coupled together 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.870
 make a memento for all then join 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.860
 but many papers for the new train 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.840
 then go the engine of dice and then 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.250
 this new train can leave 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.250
 for example in bill 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.910
 so 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.390
 the new train still leaves the train 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.390
 railway station 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.880
 and leave it to wash again
