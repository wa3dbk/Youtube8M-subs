hoppers why does anyone care and to be

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.870 
hoppers why does anyone care and to be
honest<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.890> explain<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.340> text<00:00:20.580> form<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
honest if you explain it in text form it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
honest if you explain it in text form it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
doesn't sound like a bunch cuz you know

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
doesn't sound like a bunch cuz you know
the<00:00:22.740> most<00:00:22.890> basic<00:00:23.039> hex<00:00:23.310> nation<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:24.090> they

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the most basic hex nation is out they

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.939 
the most basic hex nation is out they
take<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.779> blocks<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> block

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
take in blocks that are on the block

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
take in blocks that are on the block
above<00:00:26.189> them<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:27.060> doesn't<00:00:27.300> sound<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
above them and that doesn't sound so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
above them and that doesn't sound so
exciting<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.650> does<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.949> have

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
exciting because what use does that have

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
exciting because what use does that have
by<00:00:29.250> itself<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.090> hopefully<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.510> this

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
by itself right but hopefully in this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
by itself right but hopefully in this
video<00:00:30.869> I'll<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.740> opening<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.160> mind

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
video I'll be actually opening your mind

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
video I'll be actually opening your mind
as<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> possibilities<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.420> contain

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
as the possibilities they contain

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
as the possibilities they contain
because<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.350> big<00:00:34.680> number<00:00:35.219> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
because it's a big number of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.889 
because it's a big number of
possibilities<00:00:35.520> maybe<00:00:36.180> even<00:00:36.390> sparking<00:00:36.780> your

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
possibilities maybe even sparking your

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.540 
possibilities maybe even sparking your
creativity<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.770> getting<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.129> excited<00:00:38.520> for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
creativity and getting you excited for

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.979 
creativity and getting you excited for
hoppers<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> think<00:00:39.329> they're<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> pretty

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
hoppers because I think they're a pretty

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.020 
hoppers because I think they're a pretty
cool<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.320> block<00:00:40.890> after<00:00:41.280> research<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:41.910> them

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
cool but block after research from them

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
cool but block after research from them
and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.690> should<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.050> too<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and I think you should think that too so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
and I think you should think that too so
yeah<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.550> using<00:00:44.760> PC<00:00:45.059> gameplay<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.570> all

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
yeah this is using PC gameplay like all

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
yeah this is using PC gameplay like all
my<00:00:45.809> other<00:00:45.840> feature<00:00:46.110> previews<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.980> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
my other feature previews I think it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
my other feature previews I think it's
better<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> show<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> gameplay<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
better to show you gameplay because the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.940 
better to show you gameplay because the
PC<00:00:48.719> already<00:00:48.809> has<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
PC already has it then it is to just

into the video then sub as i said the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
into the video then sub as i said the
most<00:00:59.670> basic<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.660> convicts<00:01:01.050> mission<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
most basic you know convicts mission is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.250 
most basic you know convicts mission is
they<00:01:01.710> suck<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> any

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they suck in or you know take in any

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
they suck in or you know take in any
blocks<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> block<00:01:05.790> above<00:01:05.970> them

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
blocks that are in the block above them

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
blocks that are in the block above them
so<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.630> item<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> kind

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so if you for an item but there it kind

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020 
so if you for an item but there it kind
of<00:01:07.799> takes<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.100> okay<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> pressure<00:01:08.909> plate

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of takes it okay like a pressure plate

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
of takes it okay like a pressure plate
but<00:01:09.240> instead<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.049> actually

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
but instead at the you know actually

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.810 
but instead at the you know actually
lifting<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.310> plate<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
lifting down the first plate it just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640 
lifting down the first plate it just
takes<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.200> might<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.409> sound

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
takes there and this might not sound

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
takes there and this might not sound
like<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> whole<00:01:13.950> bunch<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> juice<00:01:14.400> cuz<00:01:14.610> oh<00:01:14.760> now

like a whole bunch of juice cuz oh now
there's<00:01:15.360> Stoppers<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.170> hopper<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.590> does

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
there's Stoppers in my hopper what does

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's Stoppers in my hopper what does
that<00:01:16.860> use<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> reality<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that use have but like in reality it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.940 
that use have but like in reality it
means<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.380> cool<00:01:19.500> things<00:01:19.560> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
means you can do some cool things so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
means you can do some cool things so
let's<00:01:20.159> say<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.549> instance<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.770> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
let's say for instance that you have to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.170 
let's say for instance that you have to
break<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> thing<00:01:23.250> clay<00:01:23.549> let's<00:01:23.939> say<00:01:24.060> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
break this thing clay let's say for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.730 
break this thing clay let's say for
instance<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> chest<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
instance you have a chest down there and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
instance you have a chest down there and
that<00:01:25.830> means<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.520> happened<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.939> any

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that means what actually happened is any

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
that means what actually happened is any
block<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> put<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.680> into

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
block that you put in there will go into

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
block that you put in there will go into
the<00:01:29.130> chest<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the chest like that so they go from the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
the chest like that so they go from the
hopper<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.560> end<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> chest

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
hopper and they end up in the chest

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.380 
hopper and they end up in the chest
there<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> pretty<00:01:32.970> cool

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
there which is pretty cool

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
there which is pretty cool
you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> same<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.860> multiple

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you can do the same thing with multiple

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.410 
you can do the same thing with multiple
hoppers<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.790> let's<00:01:36.000> say<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> have

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
hoppers here so let's say you have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.789 
hoppers here so let's say you have
hoppers<00:01:36.750> below<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.079> hoppers<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> can

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
hoppers below your hoppers then you can

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
hoppers below your hoppers then you can
if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.210> could<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
if you really want you could have like a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.539 
if you really want you could have like a
massive<00:01:40.409> chain<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> hoppers<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.220> actually

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
massive chain of hoppers they actually

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.100 
massive chain of hoppers they actually
move<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:42.000> items<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.450> some<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
move your items around some of the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
move your items around some of the
mounts<00:01:43.380> off<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.340> slowly

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
mounts off as you can see they slowly

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.359 
mounts off as you can see they slowly
pour<00:01:45.240> into<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> bottom<00:01:45.780> hopper<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.170> there

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
pour into the bottom hopper from there

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.590 
pour into the bottom hopper from there
what<00:01:47.369> makes<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.670> even<00:01:47.850> worse<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
what makes this even worse thing is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
what makes this even worse thing is
because<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.290> rest<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.680> item<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.070> came

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
because they are rest on item they came

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
because they are rest on item they came
in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> redstone<00:01:50.909> update<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.049> do

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
in the redstone update if you do

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
in the redstone update if you do
actually<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.159> let's<00:01:53.340> say<00:01:53.520> you're<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> block

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
actually a so let's say you're a block

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.789 
actually a so let's say you're a block
there<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.360> excellent<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.500> over

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
there you're excellent or just over

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230 
there you're excellent or just over
there<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.880> turn<00:01:57.119> off

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
there to actually you know turn off

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.060 
there to actually you know turn off
these<00:01:57.390> hoppers<00:01:57.780> what's<00:01:58.530> interesting<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.950> if

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
these hoppers what's interesting is if

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
these hoppers what's interesting is if
you<00:01:59.100> power<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> hoppers<00:02:00.030> instead<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> them

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you power the hoppers instead of them

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
you power the hoppers instead of them
doing<00:02:01.140> more<00:02:01.469> feat<00:02:01.740> functions<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.399> actually

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
doing more feat functions they actually

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
doing more feat functions they actually
turn<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.329> let's<00:02:03.540> say<00:02:03.750> we're<00:02:04.170> throwing<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
turn off so let's say we're throwing a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
turn off so let's say we're throwing a
hop<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:05.189> blocks<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:06.240> they

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
hop some blocks in there now now they

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
hop some blocks in there now now they
actually<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.750> stuck<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.290> because<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
actually get stuck there because this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.619 
actually get stuck there because this
hopper<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.129> turned<00:02:08.429> off<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.479> know<00:02:09.599> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
hopper is turned off you know that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.880 
hopper is turned off you know that
there's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> few<00:02:10.229> reasons<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.560> turn<00:02:10.739> off

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
there's a few reasons to turn off

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.100 
there's a few reasons to turn off
hoppers<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> boss<00:02:12.150> 302<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
hoppers it's not the boss 302 them it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.370 
hoppers it's not the boss 302 them it's
pretty

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
pretty

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.780 
pretty
to<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> redstone<00:02:13.950> item<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.400> functions

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
to have a redstone item that functions

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.250 
to have a redstone item that functions
when<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.420> powered<00:02:15.810> Robin<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.140> other

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
when it's not powered Robin the other

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.200 
when it's not powered Robin the other
way<00:02:16.320> around<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.710> yet<00:02:17.430> hoppers<00:02:17.760> already<00:02:18.060> cool

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
way around so yet hoppers already cool

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.610 
way around so yet hoppers already cool
piece<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.450> redstone<00:02:18.600> because<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> don't<00:02:19.380> need

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
piece of redstone because you don't need

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.110 
piece of redstone because you don't need
to<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:19.950> redstone<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.520> sounds<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to use redstone which sounds like a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
to use redstone which sounds like a
weird<00:02:21.270> way<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> put<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.810> there's<00:02:21.990> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
weird way to put it but there's that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.260 
weird way to put it but there's that
interesting<00:02:23.130> enough<00:02:23.310> hoppers<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:24.000> also

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
interesting enough hoppers will also

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.640 
interesting enough hoppers will also
take<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.660> anything<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.290> chest

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
take in anything that's in the chest

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.860 
take in anything that's in the chest
above<00:02:25.950> them<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.340> let's<00:02:26.970> say<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.450> chest<00:02:27.720> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
above them so let's say in this chest I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.140 
above them so let's say in this chest I
have<00:02:28.020> my<00:02:28.200> entire<00:02:28.500> stack<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.070> clay<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.790> slowly

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
have my entire stack of clay it slowly

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.790 
have my entire stack of clay it slowly
takes<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.570> clay<00:02:30.750> puts<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> hopper<00:02:31.560> then

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
takes the clay puts in the hopper then

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.260 
takes the clay puts in the hopper then
puts<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> chest<00:02:32.400> blow<00:02:32.580> which<00:02:32.790> i<00:02:32.970> think<00:02:33.030> is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
puts in the chest blow which i think is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.520 
puts in the chest blow which i think is
pretty<00:02:33.450> cool<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.750> totally<00:02:34.020> honest<00:02:34.260> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
pretty cool to be totally honest and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.350 
pretty cool to be totally honest and
yeah<00:02:35.070> that's<00:02:35.280> how<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:35.760> basically<00:02:35.910> move

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
yeah that's how you can basically move

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.120 
yeah that's how you can basically move
stuff<00:02:36.690> from<00:02:36.870> Chester<00:02:37.200> chest<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.620> let's<00:02:38.040> say

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
stuff from Chester chest so let's say

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.680 
stuff from Chester chest so let's say
this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.520> chest<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.910> my<00:02:38.940> mind<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
this is the chest in my mind and then I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
this is the chest in my mind and then I
have<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> big<00:02:40.260> string<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.770> poppers<00:02:41.070> which<00:02:41.220> go

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
have a big string of poppers which go

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.010 
have a big string of poppers which go
all<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.760> from<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.150> all<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> way<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.750> my

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
all the way from here all the way to my

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.050 
all the way from here all the way to my
main<00:02:43.260> base<00:02:43.560> over<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:43.980> let's<00:02:44.160> say<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.910> could

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
main base over there let's say you could

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.370 
main base over there let's say you could
just<00:02:45.210> put<00:02:45.330> your<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:45.780> cobblestone<00:02:46.260> in

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
just put your you know cobblestone in

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.570 
just put your you know cobblestone in
there<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.740> empty<00:02:46.950> out<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.220> oratory<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
there when you empty out the oratory and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.770 
there when you empty out the oratory and
it<00:02:47.760> will<00:02:47.850> slowly<00:02:48.000> be<00:02:48.150> transferred<00:02:48.570> all<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
it will slowly be transferred all the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.950 
it will slowly be transferred all the
way<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.960> your<00:02:49.050> base<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.480> stuff<00:02:51.630> starts<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
way to your base this stuff starts to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.510 
way to your base this stuff starts to
get<00:02:52.080> cooler<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.740> start<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.220> throw<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
get cooler when you start to throw and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.100 
get cooler when you start to throw and
stuff<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.760> furnaces<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.510> brewing<00:02:54.840> stance

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
stuff like furnaces and brewing stance

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.140 
stuff like furnaces and brewing stance
so<00:02:55.380> for<00:02:55.980> instance<00:02:56.250> let's<00:02:56.460> say<00:02:56.610> we<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so for instance let's say we have a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.910 
so for instance let's say we have a
furnace<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:57.990> what<00:02:58.440> we<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.800> if

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
furnace just here what we can do is if

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.380 
furnace just here what we can do is if
we<00:02:58.980> put<00:02:59.190> raw<00:02:59.400> beef<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> top<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.360> put

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
we put raw beef in the top and we put

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.570 
we put raw beef in the top and we put
coal<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.230> bottom<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.770> will<00:03:02.130> actually<00:03:02.220> put

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
coal in the bottom I will actually put

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580 
coal in the bottom I will actually put
keep<00:03:03.120> fueling<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.570> furnace<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.110> even<00:03:04.500> when

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
keep fueling the furnace and even when

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.750 
keep fueling the furnace and even when
it<00:03:04.650> runs<00:03:04.770> out<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> space<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.370> will<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:05.580> keep

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it runs out of space it will just keep

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.280 
it runs out of space it will just keep
on<00:03:05.910> going<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.390> that's<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:07.050> cool<00:03:07.230> thing

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
on going and that's a really cool thing

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
on going and that's a really cool thing
on<00:03:07.530> top<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.250> wanted<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> I

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
on top of that if I really wanted to I

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.520 
on top of that if I really wanted to I
could<00:03:09.120> break<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.450> down<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.380> could

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
could break it down here and I could

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.350 
could break it down here and I could
even<00:03:10.680> put<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.950> hopper<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.520> bleep<00:03:11.910> below<00:03:12.240> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
even put a hopper like bleep below it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.730 
even put a hopper like bleep below it
and<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:12.750> where<00:03:13.020> all<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> cook<00:03:13.380> beef<00:03:13.560> would

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
and that's where all the cook beef would

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.130 
and that's where all the cook beef would
go<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.790> yeah<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> takes<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
go so as you can see yeah it takes the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.140 
go so as you can see yeah it takes the
broth<00:03:16.320> beef<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.710> takes<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> coal<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.700> cooks<00:03:17.970> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
broth beef it takes the coal it cooks it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.700 
broth beef it takes the coal it cooks it
and<00:03:18.300> then<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.540> puts<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.960> hopper<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.440> you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
and then it puts in that hopper and you

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.230 
and then it puts in that hopper and you
can<00:03:19.860> just<00:03:20.010> imagine<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.000> loads

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
can just imagine then if you have loads

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.830 
can just imagine then if you have loads
of<00:03:21.300> Chester

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
of Chester

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.910 
of Chester
you<00:03:21.960> know<00:03:22.050> attach<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.440> stuff<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.710> you<00:03:22.770> have<00:03:22.860> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
you know attach this stuff so you have a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.110 
you know attach this stuff so you have a
chest<00:03:23.130> there<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.460> have<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.580> chest<00:03:23.820> there<00:03:24.000> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
chest there you have a chest there you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.820 
chest there you have a chest there you
were<00:03:24.210> just<00:03:24.240> there<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.650> some

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
were just there that you can do some

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.340 
were just there that you can do some
really<00:03:26.160> amazing<00:03:26.340> stuff<00:03:26.820> entirely<00:03:27.690> automated

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
really amazing stuff entirely automated

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.550 
really amazing stuff entirely automated
so<00:03:29.180> what<00:03:30.180> makes<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.050> next<00:03:31.290> level<00:03:31.500> of

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
so what makes this the next level of

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.350 
so what makes this the next level of
cooler<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.970> use<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.180> for<00:03:33.330> a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
cooler is if you can use this for a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.820 
cooler is if you can use this for a
bench<00:03:33.510> maps<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.870> stuff<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.260> know<00:03:34.350> in

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
bench maps and stuff so you know in

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.560 
bench maps and stuff so you know in
areas<00:03:35.310> where<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.490> have<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> be<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.880> ok<00:03:36.180> throw

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
areas where you have to be like ok throw

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.330 
areas where you have to be like ok throw
your<00:03:36.840> block<00:03:37.200> down<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.740> do<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.950> source<00:03:38.190> stuff

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
your block down and do that source stuff

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.040 
your block down and do that source stuff
you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.030> actually<00:03:39.150> trust<00:03:39.480> people<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:39.900> that

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
you can actually trust people to do that

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.440 
you can actually trust people to do that
because<00:03:40.230> basically<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.910> hopper<00:03:42.180> will<00:03:42.300> take

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
because basically the hopper will take

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.820 
because basically the hopper will take
anything<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:42.990> block<00:03:43.140> above<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.530> but

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
anything in the block above it but

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.860 
anything in the block above it but
there's<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.910> clever<00:03:45.120> little<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.630> know<00:03:45.720> way

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
there's a clever little you know way

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.810 
there's a clever little you know way
around<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.230> basically<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.740> half<00:03:47.310> slab<00:03:47.580> is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
around that basically a half slab is

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.370 
around that basically a half slab is
only<00:03:48.120> half<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.450> block<00:03:48.630> above<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.320> I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
only half the block above it so if I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.750 
only half the block above it so if I
wrote<00:03:49.530> anything<00:03:49.830> on<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.160> half<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.580> right

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
wrote anything on this half that right

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.820 
wrote anything on this half that right
here<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.180> goes<00:03:51.420> into<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.840> hopper<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.470> seems

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
here it goes into the hopper so it seems

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.320 
here it goes into the hopper so it seems
like<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.160> blocks<00:03:53.370> disappearing<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.180> it's

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
like the blocks disappearing but it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.490 
like the blocks disappearing but it's
actually<00:03:54.660> kind<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.900> registering<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.350> it's

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
actually kind of registering it it's

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.080 
actually kind of registering it it's
throwing<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:56.070> blocks<00:03:56.280> round<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.970> can

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
throwing the blocks round and you can

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.580 
throwing the blocks round and you can
have<00:03:57.240> stuff<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.720> keeps<00:03:57.840> an<00:03:58.020> eye<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.410> how

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
have stuff that keeps an eye on like how

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.620 
have stuff that keeps an eye on like how
many<00:03:58.650> blocks<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.610> so<00:03:59.880> yet

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
many blocks you have in this so yet

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.290 
many blocks you have in this so yet
there's<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.140> many<00:04:01.260> possibilities<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
there's so many possibilities of this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.850 
there's so many possibilities of this
not<00:04:03.300> only<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.720> power<00:04:03.930> furnaces<00:04:04.470> my<00:04:04.680> owner

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
not only can you power furnaces my owner

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.560 
not only can you power furnaces my owner
can<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.190> stuff<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.459> brewing<00:04:05.700> Stan's<00:04:06.000> drop

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
can you put stuff in brewing Stan's drop

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.750 
can you put stuff in brewing Stan's drop
just<00:04:06.870> droppers<00:04:07.260> as<00:04:07.470> well<00:04:07.680> as<00:04:07.800> dispensers<00:04:08.490> are

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
just droppers as well as dispensers are

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.610 
just droppers as well as dispensers are
the<00:04:08.850> hoppers<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.240> stuff<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.320> can<00:04:10.470> also

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the hoppers and stuff but you can also

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.800 
the hoppers and stuff but you can also
do<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.010> entirely<00:04:11.610> invisibly<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.390> can<00:04:12.540> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
do that entirely invisibly you can you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.880 
do that entirely invisibly you can you
know<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.140> have<00:04:13.290> people<00:04:13.530> know<00:04:13.650> what's<00:04:13.830> going

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
know not have people know what's going

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.770 
know not have people know what's going
on<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.310> there's<00:04:14.970> something<00:04:15.209> really<00:04:15.390> cool<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
on and there's something really cool and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.870 
on and there's something really cool and
strange<00:04:16.049> about<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.500> me<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.920> yeah<00:04:17.609> not

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
strange about that to me so yeah not

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520 
strange about that to me so yeah not
only<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.270> you<00:04:18.359> activate<00:04:18.660> stuff<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.350> you

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
only can you activate stuff of this you

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.020 
only can you activate stuff of this you
can<00:04:19.680> also<00:04:19.859> seal<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.340> for<00:04:20.459> instance<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:20.880> just

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
can also seal up for instance it just

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.130 
can also seal up for instance it just
keeps<00:04:21.180> throwing<00:04:21.299> my<00:04:21.540> stuff<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:21.960> hopper

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
keeps throwing my stuff in this hopper

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.080 
keeps throwing my stuff in this hopper
down<00:04:22.290> here<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.650> now<00:04:23.310> I've<00:04:23.430> got<00:04:23.580> myself<00:04:23.729> some

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
down here and now I've got myself some

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.580 
down here and now I've got myself some
free<00:04:24.330> steak<00:04:24.540> without<00:04:24.660> having<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.229> cook<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
free steak without having to cook it a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.350 
free steak without having to cook it a
so<00:04:25.890> of<00:04:26.100> course<00:04:26.580> setting<00:04:26.880> up<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.000> system

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so of course setting up the system

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.490 
so of course setting up the system
can<00:04:27.509> be<00:04:27.599> difficult<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.020> that's<00:04:28.110> just<00:04:28.379> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
can be difficult but that's just the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.679 
can be difficult but that's just the
nature<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.770> micro<00:04:29.069> right<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:30.030> that's<00:04:30.419> the

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
nature of micro right so that's the

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.689 
nature of micro right so that's the
hopper<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.379> really<00:04:31.680> cool<00:04:31.800> item<00:04:31.919> but

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
hopper it's a really cool item but

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.670 
hopper it's a really cool item but
that's<00:04:32.819> not<00:04:33.090> where<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:33.569> usability<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.349> so

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
that's not where it's a usability and so

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.080 
that's not where it's a usability and so
one<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.189> features<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.550> when<00:04:35.849> I<00:04:35.879> also

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
one of the features that when I also

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
one of the features that when I also
know<00:04:36.419> about<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.780> he<00:04:36.900> was<00:04:36.990> like<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.349> know<00:04:37.439> it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
know about it he was like you know it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.529 
know about it he was like you know it
makes<00:04:37.800> anything<00:04:38.129> automatable<00:04:38.759> so<00:04:39.210> let's<00:04:39.389> say

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
makes anything automatable so let's say

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.029 
makes anything automatable so let's say
for<00:04:39.719> instance<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.050> have<00:04:40.259> an<00:04:40.379> insane<00:04:40.740> sugar

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
for instance you have an insane sugar

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.230 
for instance you have an insane sugar
cane<00:04:41.189> phone<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.550> mine<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:41.759> goes<00:04:42.000> all<00:04:42.210> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
cane phone like mine that goes all the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.939 
cane phone like mine that goes all the
way<00:04:42.419> up<00:04:42.599> to<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.900> know<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.289> think<00:04:43.620> it's<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.770> lip

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
way up to you know I think it's a lip

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.950 
way up to you know I think it's a lip
sky<00:04:44.189> limit<00:04:44.400> on<00:04:44.490> my<00:04:44.520> ass<00:04:44.729> insane<00:04:45.419> chicken<00:04:45.750> farm

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
sky limit on my ass insane chicken farm

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.179 
sky limit on my ass insane chicken farm
let's<00:04:46.319> say<00:04:46.469> you<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.620> one<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.800> those<00:04:46.919> and

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
let's say you have one of those and

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.350 
let's say you have one of those and
there's<00:04:47.340> loads<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.759> shoot<00:04:47.939> came<00:04:48.120> dropping

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
there's loads of shoot came dropping

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.670 
there's loads of shoot came dropping
from<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.539> side<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:49.020> what<00:04:49.409> you<00:04:49.469> can<00:04:49.590> actually

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
from the side so what you can actually

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.679 
from the side so what you can actually
do<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:49.949> that<00:04:50.129> case<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.939> could<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.599> know

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
do in that case is you could you know

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:52.850 
do in that case is you could you know
hook<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> up<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.229> could<00:04:52.319> have<00:04:52.379> a<00:04:52.500> minecart

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
hook it up you could have a minecart

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.050 
hook it up you could have a minecart
with<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.069> hopper<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.400> because<00:04:53.639> that's<00:04:53.789> one<00:04:53.969> of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
with a hopper in because that's one of

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.909 
with a hopper in because that's one of
the<00:04:54.150> new<00:04:54.270> items<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.629> comes<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.169> as<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.800> can

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
the new items that comes to as you can

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.110 
the new items that comes to as you can
see<00:04:56.039> here<00:04:56.219> it's<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.580> just<00:04:56.699> a<00:04:56.819> hopper<00:04:57.000> in

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
see here it's it's just a hopper in

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.070 
see here it's it's just a hopper in
there<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.360> we'll<00:04:57.479> take<00:04:57.569> out<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.780> sugar<00:04:57.960> cane

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080

you can even use Pistons let's pretend
that<00:05:06.029> I'm<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.180> piston<00:05:06.599> here<00:05:06.719> and<00:05:06.930> what<00:05:07.529> the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that I'm the piston here and what the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.990 
that I'm the piston here and what the
minecart<00:05:08.069> will<00:05:08.159> actually<00:05:08.370> do<00:05:08.490> is<00:05:08.639> it'll<00:05:08.789> pick

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
minecart will actually do is it'll pick

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.330 
minecart will actually do is it'll pick
it<00:05:09.120> up<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.449> then<00:05:10.379> you've<00:05:10.529> you<00:05:10.710> know<00:05:11.159> you<00:05:11.250> don't

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
it up and then you've you know you don't

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.679 
it up and then you've you know you don't
have<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.550> worry<00:05:11.729> about<00:05:11.819> it<00:05:12.029> your<00:05:12.210> mind<00:05:12.509> coach

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689 
have to worry about it your mind coach

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.390 
have to worry about it your mind coach
picks<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.020> up<00:05:13.080> for<00:05:13.229> you<00:05:13.379> on<00:05:13.680> top<00:05:13.889> of<00:05:14.009> that<00:05:14.159> if

picks it up for you on top of that if

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.830 
picks it up for you on top of that if
you<00:05:14.580> want<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.789> go<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.029> next<00:05:15.060> step<00:05:15.360> crazier

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you want to go the next step crazier

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.990 
you want to go the next step crazier
what<00:05:16.379> you<00:05:16.439> could<00:05:16.560> even<00:05:16.740> do<00:05:16.949> then<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:17.460> with<00:05:17.849> the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
what you could even do then is with the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.490 
what you could even do then is with the
minecart<00:05:18.389> picking<00:05:18.629> up<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.990> have<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> chest

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
minecart picking up you have a chest

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.929 
minecart picking up you have a chest
below<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.860> for<00:05:19.889> instance<00:05:20.189> this<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.789> powering

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
below it for instance this is powering

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.550 
below it for instance this is powering
the<00:05:21.090> rail<00:05:21.240> you<00:05:21.779> could<00:05:21.870> have<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.020> chest<00:05:22.259> below

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
the rail you could have a chest below

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.920 
the rail you could have a chest below
the<00:05:22.830> thingamajig<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.669> oops<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.449> just<00:05:24.659> reversed

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
the thingamajig and oops I just reversed

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.050 
the thingamajig and oops I just reversed
it<00:05:25.139> whatever<00:05:25.259> you<00:05:26.219> have<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.430> chest<00:05:26.639> below<00:05:26.849> there

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
it whatever you have a chest below there

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.640 
it whatever you have a chest below there
and<00:05:27.180> then<00:05:27.419> you<00:05:27.509> could<00:05:27.689> make<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:27.990> take<00:05:28.139> all<00:05:28.379> if

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
and then you could make it take all if

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.230 
and then you could make it take all if
the<00:05:28.800> ship<00:05:28.979> came<00:05:29.189> put<00:05:29.400> in<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.550> chest<00:05:29.819> and<00:05:30.060> then

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
the ship came put in a chest and then

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.420 
the ship came put in a chest and then
have<00:05:30.419> like<00:05:30.539> a<00:05:30.599> automated<00:05:31.319> sugarcane<00:05:31.800> farm<00:05:32.039> you

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
have like a automated sugarcane farm you

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.589 
have like a automated sugarcane farm you
could<00:05:32.550> also<00:05:32.699> do<00:05:32.909> this<00:05:33.000> for<00:05:33.120> wheat<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.509> an

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
could also do this for wheat have an

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.659 
could also do this for wheat have an
automated<00:05:33.839> wheat<00:05:34.080> bomb<00:05:34.259> and<00:05:34.469> yeah<00:05:34.860> as<00:05:35.069> as<00:05:35.370> like

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
automated wheat bomb and yeah as as like

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.459 
automated wheat bomb and yeah as as like
I<00:05:35.789> just<00:05:35.849> said<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.330> makes<00:05:36.509> anything<00:05:36.870> automate

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
I just said it makes anything automate

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.559 
I just said it makes anything automate
spool<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.860> that's<00:05:38.279> really<00:05:38.729> crazy<00:05:39.120> cool<00:05:39.449> in<00:05:39.539> my

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
spool and that's really crazy cool in my

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.010 
spool and that's really crazy cool in my
opinion

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
opinion

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.829 
opinion
so<00:05:40.279> to<00:05:41.279> kind<00:05:41.430> of<00:05:41.520> recap<00:05:41.849> hoppers<00:05:42.449> are<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.629> really

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839 
so to kind of recap hoppers are a really

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.480 
so to kind of recap hoppers are a really
cool<00:05:42.870> block<00:05:43.199> because<00:05:43.560> they<00:05:43.710> take<00:05:43.919> items<00:05:44.310> in

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
cool block because they take items in

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.129 
cool block because they take items in
from<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.759> block<00:05:44.879> above<00:05:45.089> them<00:05:45.300> but<00:05:45.449> they're

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
from the block above them but they're

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.329 
from the block above them but they're
you<00:05:46.349> know<00:05:46.379> their<00:05:46.770> list<00:05:46.949> of<00:05:47.069> possibilities

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
you know their list of possibilities

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.860 
you know their list of possibilities
doesn't<00:05:47.879> end<00:05:48.000> there<00:05:48.120> because<00:05:48.180> there's<00:05:48.629> so

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
doesn't end there because there's so

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.659 
doesn't end there because there's so
many<00:05:49.110> cool<00:05:49.349> things<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.680> can<00:05:49.860> do<00:05:49.979> so<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.550> know

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
many cool things you can do so you know

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.249 
many cool things you can do so you know
it<00:05:50.789> is<00:05:50.819> it<00:05:51.180> doesn't<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:51.479> stop<00:05:51.810> but<00:05:51.990> having

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
it is it doesn't just stop but having

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.019 
it is it doesn't just stop but having
you<00:05:52.589> know<00:05:52.680> stuff<00:05:52.919> going<00:05:53.159> to<00:05:53.250> chest<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.879> can

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
you know stuff going to chest you can

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.179 
you know stuff going to chest you can
put<00:05:54.539> stuff<00:05:54.629> into<00:05:54.930> hoppers<00:05:55.259> make<00:05:55.680> a<00:05:55.710> really

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189 
put stuff into hoppers make a really

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.829 
put stuff into hoppers make a really
long<00:05:56.339> chain<00:05:56.610> of<00:05:56.639> it<00:05:56.849> that<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.120> go<00:05:57.240> as<00:05:57.360> far<00:05:57.659> as

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
long chain of it that can go as far as

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.540 
long chain of it that can go as far as
you<00:05:57.990> want<00:05:58.020> behind<00:05:58.469> the<00:05:58.529> scenes<00:05:58.770> just<00:05:59.339> moving

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
you want behind the scenes just moving

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.459 
you want behind the scenes just moving
items<00:05:59.849> around<00:06:00.120> if<00:06:00.689> you<00:06:00.810> really<00:06:01.080> want<00:06:01.289> you<00:06:01.439> can

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
move stuff and chest the chest like this

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.209 
move stuff and chest the chest like this
as<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.389> just<00:06:03.659> saw<00:06:03.839> so<00:06:04.080> up<00:06:04.289> fro<00:06:04.469> these<00:06:04.680> uh<00:06:04.710> stake

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
as you just saw so up fro these uh stake

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.179 
as you just saw so up fro these uh stake
in<00:06:05.339> there<00:06:05.460> again<00:06:06.289> you<00:06:07.289> can<00:06:07.439> also<00:06:07.589> pure<00:06:07.919> stuff

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
in there again you can also pure stuff

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.279 
in there again you can also pure stuff
in<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.460> dispenser<00:06:09.029> in<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.300> furnace<00:06:09.870> using<00:06:10.169> this

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
in a dispenser in a furnace using this

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.959 
in a dispenser in a furnace using this
let's<00:06:10.560> say<00:06:10.680> this<00:06:10.800> was<00:06:10.949> an<00:06:11.039> entire<00:06:11.400> chest<00:06:11.789> for

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
let's say this was an entire chest for

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.790 
let's say this was an entire chest for
the<00:06:12.029> third<00:06:12.210> row<00:06:12.419> beef<00:06:12.599> this<00:06:12.990> is<00:06:13.080> an<00:06:13.139> entire<00:06:13.500> you

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
the third row beef this is an entire you

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.589 
the third row beef this is an entire you
know<00:06:13.830> hopper<00:06:14.099> full<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.460> coal<00:06:14.669> it<00:06:15.180> would<00:06:15.419> just

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
know hopper full of coal it would just

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.179
