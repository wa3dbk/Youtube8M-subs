00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
were actually on the on the tree I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
were actually on the on the tree I
noticed<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.879> holes<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> peaches

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
noticed a little holes in the peaches

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
noticed a little holes in the peaches
and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> kind<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and then you would see this this kind of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
and then you would see this this kind of
duty<00:00:49.140> stuff<00:00:49.410> coming<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> looked

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
duty stuff coming out it kind of looked

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
duty stuff coming out it kind of looked
like<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.739> guess<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> best<00:00:53.070> way<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> describe<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like I guess the best way to describe it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
like I guess the best way to describe it
it<00:00:53.879> looked<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.440> superglue<00:00:56.070> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it looked like if you get superglue in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
it looked like if you get superglue in
it<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.120> hardens<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.750> bit

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it and it kind of hardens a little bit

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
it and it kind of hardens a little bit
kind<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.620> transparent<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.899> but<00:01:01.789> little<00:01:02.789> bit

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
kind of transparent but but little bit

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
kind of transparent but but little bit
of<00:01:02.969> color<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> looked

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of color to it that's what it looked

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
of color to it that's what it looked
like<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.860> ruined<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.489> peach<00:01:05.700> crop<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.780> this
