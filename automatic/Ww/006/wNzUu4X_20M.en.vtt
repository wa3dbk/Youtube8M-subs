00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.930
 my life 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.490
 the national meteorological service is 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.290
 informing on this occasion about all the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.520
 large unstable area that is in 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.170
 the north and the northeast the republic 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.789
 mexicana on the part of what is the 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.370
 remnant of the remnant that the front 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.470
 cold number 53 and that keeps getting 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.990
 that region damp both the Gulf of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.730
 Mexico like the Pacific 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.920
 we also continue with a very 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
 unstable and this is originating 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.360
 precisely the potential for 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 whirlpool formation and even of 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.320
 tornadoes in the states of coahuila 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.660
 new lion and tamaulipas in his region 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.329
 North mainly on the other hand 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.039
 continues what is the air intake 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.519
 wet of the Caribbean of the Gulf of Mexico and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.949
 also as I had indicated of the pacific 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.300
 and we will continue to see an increase in 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.129
 cloudy with presentations towards the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.920
 late and late night they could get to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.379
 be strong in what is the center 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.280
 of the country very strong in the south as well 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.499
 that in the southeast of the republic 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.140
 Mexican some very strong there are also 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.620
 in coahuila forts in new lion and 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.900
 also in the taste 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.310
 means the good part of the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.250
 Mexican Republic its most 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.290
 will continue to record rainfall for 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.920
 those next three days while the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.810
 temperatures 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 but they still carry the very high 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 of the very hot colossus 34 in Chihuahua 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 Nes 34 30 hermosillo vision of peace not 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.909
 you say 33 there in more jump and 22 just 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.130
 in tijuana with a clear sky 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.229
 good part of the day very sunny and from there 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 precisely responds these neighborhoods of 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.930
 temperature for the northeast region of the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.000
 Mexican Republic The Northeast also a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 really hot value for this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 region the sky half cloudy to cloudy 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.520
 with precipitation with activity 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.429
 electrical that you have can extend 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.120
 towards the north region of the table of 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.850
 center of the west 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.150
 very clean in the morning very sunny 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.070
 temperature less than 32 33 be hot 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.440
 an environment towards the center a little more 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.560
 humid the temperature reaches 26 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.750
 degrees and this is also an environment of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.100
 radiant warm with in cloudy and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.770
 precipitation mainly by the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.510
 late some new cities that continue 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.850
 3 reporters to the high areas of the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.470
 warrior state in Cuernavaca what 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.020
 is the state of morelos mainly 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.090
 in generalized clouds and from 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.160
 the evening of the night with storms 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.870
 make region be precipitation 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.280
 stormy and that can also be 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.950
 extend to the state of mexico where 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.990
 we can expect some heavy rain in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.840
 morelos in the capital of the republic 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.390
 mexicana and in the state of mexico for 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 the southeast also the southeast continues 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.930
 getting quite wet and from 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 then the formation of cloudiness is 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.410
 important also for the temperature 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.120
 that exists in these regions that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.400
 really very high and expect some 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.670
 very strong rainfall in guajará 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.140
 strong the president knows of veracruz 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.640
 for expertise directly in 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.220
 calibration environment the middle sky 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.959
 cloudy with light rainfall 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.880
 occasionally moderate but the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.650
 temperatures in everything that is in your 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.540
 list and the expertise that so in values 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.250
 only very expensive chlorine-soda 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.410
 values ​​but in fact the temperatures 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.580
 they are elevated in everything in all our 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.520
 territory for the city of mexico 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.100
 this Thursday, Friday and Saturday, again 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.750
 the very sunny morning the middle afternoon 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.850
 cloudy to cloudy with precipitation in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.040
 the city of mexico the temperature does not 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.450
 can change a lot from 26 to 27 great the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.330
 maximum temperature for the capital of the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.080
 Mexican Republic and the minimum of 13 a 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.400
 14 degrees celsius that the most important thing 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.450
 What we have to you is the service 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.450
 national meteorological 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.599
