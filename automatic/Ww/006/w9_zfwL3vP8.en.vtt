00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.490 
managed to get these stickers on this
well<00:03:15.459> except<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.420> red<00:03:16.570> nodes<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.019> don't

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
well except for the red nodes I don't

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.259 
well except for the red nodes I don't
even<00:03:17.560> know<00:03:17.800> how<00:03:18.400> they're<00:03:18.610> sticking<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.120> this

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
even know how they're sticking on this

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.050 
even know how they're sticking on this
is<00:03:19.450> such<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:20.410> he<00:03:21.160> rounded<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.640> off<00:03:21.820> so

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
is such a like he rounded this off so

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.740 
is such a like he rounded this off so
perfectly<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.840> wonder<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.620> he<00:03:23.709> used<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.040> this

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
perfectly I wonder what he used for this

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
all that the turning stickers really

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.670 
all that the turning stickers really
nice<00:03:39.610> but<00:03:40.300> not<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.080> do<00:03:41.140> first<00:03:41.260> turns<00:03:41.530> at

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
nice but not going to do first turns at

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.470 
nice but not going to do first turns at
all<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.070> it'll<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.730> pretty<00:03:42.850> tough<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.299> me<00:03:43.390> not

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
all and it'll be pretty tough for me not

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.539 
all and it'll be pretty tough for me not
to<00:03:43.540> turn<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.989> but<00:03:44.590> here<00:03:44.830> i<00:03:44.860> guess<00:03:45.070> there's<00:03:45.250> two

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
to turn it but here i guess there's two

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.820 
to turn it but here i guess there's two
shades<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:46.000> blue<00:03:46.150> which<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.390> nice<00:03:46.750> hit<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
shades of blue which is nice hit the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.289 
shades of blue which is nice hit the
green<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.519> receiving<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.970> right<00:03:49.090> color

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
green is receiving the right color

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.479 
green is receiving the right color
scheme<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:51.450> don't<00:03:52.450> even<00:03:52.510> know<00:03:53.160> anyway<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:54.340> is

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
scheme I don't even know anyway this is

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.830 
scheme I don't even know anyway this is
a<00:03:54.519> really<00:03:54.820> interesting<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.239> really<00:03:55.269> want<00:03:55.810> to
