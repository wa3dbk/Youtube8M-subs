00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so first of all you have to start with

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.019 
so first of all you have to start with
fresh<00:00:19.529> palm<00:00:19.830> seeds<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.550> harvested

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
fresh palm seeds and these are harvested

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.050 
fresh palm seeds and these are harvested
locally<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.810> salt<00:00:22.590> spring<00:00:22.859> island<00:00:23.060> fresh

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
locally here on salt spring island fresh

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
locally here on salt spring island fresh
is<00:00:24.240> best<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.779> if<00:00:24.930> you're<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.140> sure<00:00:25.199> about<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is best and if you're not sure about the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.019 
is best and if you're not sure about the
freshness<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.519> always<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.820> those

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
freshness you can always take those

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
freshness you can always take those
seeds<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.480> dump<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.099> throw<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
seeds and dump them in a throw some of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
seeds and dump them in a throw some of
them<00:00:29.519> into<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> cup<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.840> water<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.470> they<00:00:31.679> float

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
them into a cup of water if they float

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.150 
them into a cup of water if they float
you're<00:00:32.520> usually<00:00:32.850> no<00:00:32.969> good<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.690> sink

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
you're usually no good and if they sink

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
you're usually no good and if they sink
they're<00:00:35.160> most<00:00:35.340> likely<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:35.969> fine<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
they're most likely going to be fine so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
they're most likely going to be fine so
I<00:00:37.550> harvested<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:38.730> seeds<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I harvested these seeds about two and a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
I harvested these seeds about two and a
half<00:00:39.930> months<00:00:40.410> ago<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.059> like<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.180> say<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
half months ago and like I say the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.959 
half months ago and like I say the
longer<00:00:42.629> these<00:00:42.899> seats<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> less<00:00:44.040> viable

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
longer these seats it the less viable

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
longer these seats it the less viable
that<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.329> become<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.469> these

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that they become so these these

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069 
that they become so these these
particular<00:00:47.370> seeds<00:00:47.969> I've<00:00:48.300> harvested<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
particular seeds I've harvested from a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
particular seeds I've harvested from a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
Trekkie carpets four to nine nearby so

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
Trekkie carpets four to nine nearby so
most<00:00:57.989> likely<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.239> mostly

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
most likely these are going to be mostly

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
most likely these are going to be mostly
hybrids<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.770> track<00:01:02.309> ich<00:01:02.460> ARPA

hybrids but with some track ich ARPA
swag<00:01:02.940> nori<00:01:03.180> anise<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
swag nori anise in there as well so the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.200 
swag nori anise in there as well so the
seeds<00:01:06.030> look<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
seeds look like this you can see that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.109 
seeds look like this you can see that
they're<00:01:10.170> kidney<00:01:10.530> shaped<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> they<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
they're kidney shaped and they have a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.760 
they're kidney shaped and they have a
light<00:01:12.390> skin<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.229> bother<00:01:13.470> taking

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
light skin on them I don't bother taking

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.539 
light skin on them I don't bother taking
that<00:01:14.100> skin<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.830> easiest<00:01:17.070> way<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> do

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that skin off so the easiest way to do

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.600 
that skin off so the easiest way to do
this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:20.060> grab<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> seed<00:01:21.360> flat<00:01:22.009> perforated<00:01:23.009> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this is grab a seed flat perforated so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.130 
this is grab a seed flat perforated so
there's<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.909> seed<00:01:24.210> starting<00:01:24.659> trait<00:01:24.900> right

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
there's your seed starting trait right

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.460 
there's your seed starting trait right
there<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:27.259> perforation<00:01:28.259> on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
there and it's got some perforation on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
there and it's got some perforation on
the<00:01:28.590> bottom<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> water<00:01:29.340> drains<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.030> I'm

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the bottom so the water drains and I'm

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.330 
the bottom so the water drains and I'm
using<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.500> promix<00:01:32.250> HP<00:01:33.770> well<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.920> sorry

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
using a promix HP well actually sorry

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
using a promix HP well actually sorry
this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.970> sunshine<00:01:36.450> mix<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.560> so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this is actually a sunshine mix or so

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
this is actually a sunshine mix or so
this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.070> basically<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> same<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> pro<00:01:39.509> mix

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this is basically the same as a pro mix

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
this is basically the same as a pro mix
so<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.290> peat<00:01:40.530> moss<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.070> those<00:01:41.970> lots<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so with peat moss with those lots of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.780 
so with peat moss with those lots of
perlite<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.979> fill<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> tray<00:01:44.640> up

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
perlite in it so I fill the tray up

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.929 
perlite in it so I fill the tray up
right<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> damp<00:01:45.869> dampened

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
right there with the damp dampened

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.060 
right there with the damp dampened
growing<00:01:47.939> medium<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:49.560> dump<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
growing medium and I dump it in the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.600 
growing medium and I dump it in the
window

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
window

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.250 
window
just<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
just like that

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.280 
just like that
I've<00:01:52.440> dump<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.800> into<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.160> wheelbarrow<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
I've dump that into the wheelbarrow and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
I've dump that into the wheelbarrow and
then<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.740> easiest<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.210> mix

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
then the easiest way to do this to mix

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.250 
then the easiest way to do this to mix
them<00:01:57.570> evenly<00:01:57.900> through

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
them evenly through

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.200 
them evenly through
Vickey<00:02:00.950> seasons<00:02:01.430> just<00:02:01.520> start<00:02:01.790> peeling<00:02:01.970> them

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
Vickey seasons just start peeling them

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.450 
Vickey seasons just start peeling them
off<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.510> seed<00:02:02.690> stocks<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.410> mean<00:02:03.800> look<00:02:04.430> you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
off the seed stocks I mean look you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.280 
off the seed stocks I mean look you
people<00:02:04.760> will<00:02:05.000> probably<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:05.570> new<00:02:05.750> seeds<00:02:06.080> if

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
people will probably have new seeds if

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.010 
people will probably have new seeds if
you<00:02:06.410> boarded<00:02:06.740> them<00:02:06.890> throughout<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.730> mail

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
you boarded them throughout the mail

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.740 
you boarded them throughout the mail
eBay<00:02:09.760> or<00:02:10.760> anyway<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.030> what<00:02:11.270> I'm<00:02:11.360> doing<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:11.720> is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
eBay or anyway so what I'm doing now is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.380 
eBay or anyway so what I'm doing now is
stripping<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.320> seeds<00:02:12.590> off<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.980> here<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.240 

dumping<00:02:17.390> them<00:02:17.510> onto<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.900> seed<00:02:18.170> mixture<00:02:18.620> into

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
dumping them onto that seed mixture into

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.760 
dumping them onto that seed mixture into
the<00:02:19.520> wheel<00:02:19.760> bro<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:21.230> reason<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.560> fill<00:02:21.740> up

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the wheel bro and the reason I fill up

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.280 
the wheel bro and the reason I fill up
the<00:02:21.890> flat<00:02:22.220> with<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.490> seed<00:02:23.150> starter<00:02:23.570> mix<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.230> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the flat with the seed starter mix so I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
the flat with the seed starter mix so I
know<00:02:24.410> exactly<00:02:24.550> how<00:02:25.550> much<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.850> need

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
know exactly how much I need

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.200 
know exactly how much I need
last<00:02:27.540> year<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> saw<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.560> dozen<00:02:29.280> flats<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.030> grew

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
last year I saw a dozen flats so I grew

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.600 
last year I saw a dozen flats so I grew
about<00:02:30.330> 12,000<00:02:31.080> palm<00:02:31.920> seedlings<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.490> I'll

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
I know people growing them in 7b but

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
I know people growing them in 7b but
they're<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.430> need<00:03:14.520> some<00:03:14.760> sort<00:03:14.940> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
they're going to need some sort of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.150 
they're going to need some sort of
protection<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.690> colder<00:03:16.020> winters<00:03:16.350> here<00:03:16.620> in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
protection in the colder winters here in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.140 
protection in the colder winters here in
our<00:03:17.700> climate

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
our climate

Gulf Islands and up the southwest coast
to<00:03:21.900> British<00:03:22.140> Columbia<00:03:22.760> they<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.820> not<00:03:24.060> need<00:03:24.180> any

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
to British Columbia they do not need any

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.910 
to British Columbia they do not need any
protection<00:03:24.600> they<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.590> completely<00:03:26.040> foolproof

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
protection they are completely foolproof

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.750 
protection they are completely foolproof
ok<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.100> think<00:03:29.160> I've<00:03:29.370> stripped<00:03:29.610> everything

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
ok so I think I've stripped everything

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.250 
ok so I think I've stripped everything
off<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.390> get<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.660> idea

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
off you get the idea

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.350 
off you get the idea
then<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:31.950> gonna<00:03:32.040> put<00:03:32.220> my<00:03:32.310> gloves<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.790> cuz<00:03:33.300> I

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
then I'm gonna put my gloves on cuz I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.970 
then I'm gonna put my gloves on cuz I
got<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> few<00:03:33.720> cracks<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.320> my<00:03:34.380> fingers<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:34.890> they

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
got a few cracks and my fingers and they

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.570 
got a few cracks and my fingers and they
don't<00:03:35.160> do<00:03:35.250> it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
don't do it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.260 
don't do it
get<00:03:35.910> them<00:03:36.060> cracked<00:03:36.360> anymore<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:39.060> we're<00:03:39.180> gonna

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
get them cracked anymore so we're gonna

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.100 
get them cracked anymore so we're gonna
mix<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:40.850> mix<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.000> up<00:03:42.150> by<00:03:42.300> hand<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.050> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
mix it mix it up by hand so now the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.220 
mix it mix it up by hand so now the
seeds<00:03:43.440> are<00:03:43.650> evenly<00:03:44.040> distributed<00:03:44.700> throughout

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
seeds are evenly distributed throughout

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.150 
seeds are evenly distributed throughout
this<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:48.720> growing<00:03:48.960> medium<00:03:49.410> then<00:03:49.950> I'm<00:03:50.040> gonna

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
this this growing medium then I'm gonna

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.060 
this this growing medium then I'm gonna
take<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.580> tray<00:03:54.410> actually<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.470> easiest<00:03:55.830> way

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
take this tray actually the easiest way

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.330 
take this tray actually the easiest way
to<00:03:56.100> do<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:57.440> would<00:03:58.440> probably<00:03:58.650> be<00:03:58.830> just<00:03:59.130> like

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to do this would probably be just like

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.850 
to do this would probably be just like
that<00:03:59.810> let's<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:00.960> dump<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.320> right<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
that let's just dump it right into the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.990 
that let's just dump it right into the
tray<00:04:03.770> out<00:04:04.770> of<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.920> wheelbarrow<00:04:05.660> easy<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:07.800> do

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
tray out of the wheelbarrow easy to do
