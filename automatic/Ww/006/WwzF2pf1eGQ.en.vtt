yeah<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.310> may<00:04:19.520> have<00:04:19.549> some<00:04:20.140> grains<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.380> ballast

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
yeah you may have some grains of ballast

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.210 
yeah you may have some grains of ballast
stuck<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.630> ties<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.320> that's<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> big<00:04:24.920> deal

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
stuck the ties but that's not a big deal

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.820 
stuck the ties but that's not a big deal
you<00:04:25.640> can<00:04:25.670> take<00:04:26.060> two<00:04:26.480> take<00:04:26.660> your<00:04:26.810> finger<00:04:27.200> and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
you can take two take your finger and

you can take two take your finger and
run<00:04:28.070> them<00:04:28.190> across<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.700> top<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.630> loosen<00:04:30.970> any

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
run them across the top to loosen any

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.810 
run them across the top to loosen any
grains<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:33.190> ballast<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.220> are<00:04:34.490> stuck<00:04:34.670> at<00:04:34.790> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
grains of ballast that are stuck at the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.670 
grains of ballast that are stuck at the
top<00:04:35.000> of<00:04:35.210> rails<00:04:35.390> or<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:35.960> could<00:04:36.140> use<00:04:36.320> just<00:04:36.350> a

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
top of rails or you could use just a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.130 
top of rails or you could use just a
regular<00:04:36.770> eraser<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.180> just<00:04:38.480> go<00:04:38.600> over<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.930> top

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
regular eraser and just go over the top

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.350 
regular eraser and just go over the top
lightly<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.130> your<00:04:40.250> ties<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.810> loosen<00:04:41.810> up<00:04:41.930> any

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
lightly of your ties to loosen up any

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.700 
lightly of your ties to loosen up any
ballast<00:04:44.360> that's<00:04:44.600> stuck<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.080> them<00:04:45.170> but<00:04:45.350> we'll

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
ballast that's stuck to them but we'll

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.850 
ballast that's stuck to them but we'll
get<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.660> point<00:04:47.660> later<00:04:47.930> in<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.410> little<00:04:48.680> bit

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
get to that point later in a little bit

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.220 
get to that point later in a little bit
and<00:04:49.130> once<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.400> get<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.670> all<00:04:50.500> smooth<00:04:51.500> out<00:04:53.230> there

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
and once I get this all smooth out there

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.780 
and once I get this all smooth out there
we<00:04:54.350> go

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
we go

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.170 
we go
got<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.210> spilling<00:04:55.480> over<00:04:55.630> nicely<00:04:56.760> either<00:04:57.760> side

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
got it spilling over nicely either side

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.590 
got it spilling over nicely either side
just<00:04:58.600> like<00:04:59.020> that<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:01.620> if<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:03.570> have<00:05:04.570> a

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
just like that and if you have a

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.120 
just like that and if you have a
situation<00:05:05.050> where<00:05:06.750> end<00:05:07.750> up<00:05:07.870> wisdom<00:05:08.050> has<00:05:08.950> some

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
situation where end up wisdom has some

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.160 
situation where end up wisdom has some
bare<00:05:09.400> spots<00:05:09.790> there<00:05:10.150> it's<00:05:10.420> not<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.570> big<00:05:10.810> deal<00:05:10.990> you

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
bare spots there it's not a big deal you

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.810 
bare spots there it's not a big deal you
can<00:05:11.230> always<00:05:11.440> go<00:05:11.680> back<00:05:11.920> and<00:05:11.950> add<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.310> little<00:05:12.550> more

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
can always go back and add a little more

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:20.130 
can always go back and add a little more
and<00:05:14.370> give<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> shot<00:05:15.700> of<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:19.030> wet<00:05:19.450> water<00:05:19.720> and

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
and give a shot of the wet water and

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.420 
and give a shot of the wet water and
then<00:05:21.300> your<00:05:22.300> uh<00:05:23.910> excuse<00:05:24.910> me<00:05:24.940> boy

then your uh excuse me boy

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.070 
then your uh excuse me boy
and<00:05:27.430> then<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.670> scenic<00:05:27.970> cement<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.630> that'll

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
and then the scenic cement and that'll

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.780 
and then the scenic cement and that'll
take<00:05:29.230> care<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.770> if<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.250> was<00:05:30.370> any<00:05:30.550> bare<00:05:30.760> spots

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
take care of it if it was any bare spots

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.020 
take care of it if it was any bare spots
so<00:05:31.390> that's<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:31.960> kind<00:05:32.140> of<00:05:32.200> a<00:05:32.550> basic<00:05:33.550> method

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
so that's that's kind of a basic method

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.250 
so that's that's kind of a basic method
I<00:05:34.240> use<00:05:34.780> know<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.500> may<00:05:35.980> have<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.250> problem<00:05:37.260> here

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
I use know you may have a problem here

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.050 
I use know you may have a problem here
now<00:05:38.590> you've<00:05:38.860> got<00:05:39.040> these<00:05:39.190> little<00:05:39.340> Peaks<00:05:39.790> on

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
now you've got these little Peaks on

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.700 
now you've got these little Peaks on
either<00:05:40.210> side<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:41.050> know<00:05:41.200> we'll<00:05:41.350> call<00:05:41.500> that

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
either side you know we'll call that

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.860 
either side you know we'll call that
excess<00:05:42.240> ballast<00:05:43.240> ELISA<00:05:43.510> is<00:05:43.630> where<00:05:43.780> the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
excess ballast ELISA is where the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.680 
excess ballast ELISA is where the
one-inch<00:05:44.260> brush<00:05:44.850> comes<00:05:45.850> in<00:05:46.000> handy<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.510> just

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
one-inch brush comes in handy and I just

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.650 
one-inch brush comes in handy and I just
kind<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:46.900> take<00:05:47.140> it<00:05:47.170> and<00:05:47.470> just<00:05:48.180> kind<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.360> tamp<00:05:49.600> it

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
kind of take it and just kind of tamp it

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.360 
kind of take it and just kind of tamp it
down<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.900> little<00:05:50.050> bit<00:05:50.260> just<00:05:50.500> kind<00:05:50.980> of<00:05:51.010> level<00:05:51.280> it

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
down a little bit just kind of level it

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.190 
down a little bit just kind of level it
out<00:05:52.890> okay<00:05:55.230> get<00:05:56.230> a<00:05:56.260> nice<00:05:56.470> little<00:05:56.710> profile<00:05:58.200> just

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
out okay get a nice little profile just

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.900 
out okay get a nice little profile just
like<00:05:59.380> that<00:06:05.010> get<00:06:06.010> rid<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.220> those<00:06:06.370> Peaks<00:06:06.700> on

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
like that get rid of those Peaks on

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.540 
like that get rid of those Peaks on
either<00:06:07.060> side
