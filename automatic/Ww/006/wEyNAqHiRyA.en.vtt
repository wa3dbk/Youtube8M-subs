00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320 

and<00:00:00.659> as<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.230> can<00:00:01.439> see<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:02.149> hydrogen<00:00:03.149> is

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
and as you can see the hydrogen is

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.680 
and as you can see the hydrogen is
bubbling<00:00:03.750> up<00:00:03.959> from<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.350> solar<00:00:04.650> power<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.690> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
bubbling up from the solar power and the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.180 
bubbling up from the solar power and the
back<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.259> solar<00:00:09.290> collector<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.530> creating<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
back the solar collector is creating the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.860 
back the solar collector is creating the
hydrogen<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.719> now<00:00:13.639> we<00:00:14.639> will<00:00:14.849> plug<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
hydrogen so now we will plug in the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.019 
hydrogen so now we will plug in the
motor<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:21.080> instantaneously<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:23.070> will<00:00:23.340> begin

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
motor and instantaneously we will begin

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.790 
motor and instantaneously we will begin
to<00:00:24.240> consume<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.050> gas<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.800> created

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
to consume this gas that we created

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.359 
to consume this gas that we created
without<00:00:28.800> even<00:00:29.160> touching<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.029> metal<00:00:31.219> that<00:00:32.219> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
without even touching the metal that was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.680 
without even touching the metal that was
going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> consume<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.329> gas<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:35.570> turn<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
going to consume this gas and turn it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to consume this gas and turn it
into<00:00:36.809> electricity<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> miracle<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
into electricity through the miracle of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
into electricity through the miracle of
the<00:00:39.800> hydrogen<00:00:40.800> fuel<00:00:41.219> cell<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.890> then<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the hydrogen fuel cell and then has to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.369 
the hydrogen fuel cell and then has to
shift<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> hydrogen<00:00:45.899> power<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
shift down to the hydrogen power and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
shift down to the hydrogen power and
there's<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> tank<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.730> see

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
there's the tank in the back you can see

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.299 
there's the tank in the back you can see
the<00:00:48.300> tank<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.469> lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> hydrogen

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the tank has still got a lot of hydrogen

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.439 
the tank has still got a lot of hydrogen
left<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.800> electrolysis<00:00:53.370> yeah<00:00:56.210> what<00:00:57.210> an

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
left through electrolysis yeah what an

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.740 
left through electrolysis yeah what an
experiment<00:01:01.850> let's<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> wide<00:01:03.359> shot<00:01:03.719> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
experiment let's get the wide shot of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.859 
experiment let's get the wide shot of
the<00:01:04.019> crowd<00:01:04.850> guys<00:01:05.850> stay<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> crowds<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.750> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the crowd guys stay the crowds are in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.000 
the crowd guys stay the crowds are in
the<00:01:06.990> circle<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.729> there<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.650> there<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the circle here there they are there a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
the circle here there they are there a
wheel<00:01:11.460> fell<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.210> didn't<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
wheel fell off I didn't get that the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
wheel fell off I didn't get that the
first<00:01:13.560> flat<00:01:13.860> tire<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> hydrogen<00:01:14.760> car<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
first flat tire of a hydrogen car in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800 
first flat tire of a hydrogen car in
certain<00:01:15.840> sapphire<00:01:16.380> Shores<00:01:17.450> there<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> goes

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
certain sapphire Shores there it goes

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.280 
certain sapphire Shores there it goes
solar<00:01:19.290> powered<00:01:20.119> into<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> shade<00:01:21.509> kicks<00:01:22.049> into

solar powered into the shade kicks into

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
solar powered into the shade kicks into
the<00:01:22.530> hydrogen<00:01:23.070> power<00:01:24.560> keeps<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.580> we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the hydrogen power keeps going would we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
the hydrogen power keeps going would we
lose<00:01:27.110> front<00:01:28.110> tire<00:01:29.810> will<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.020> without<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
lose front tire will you go without a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
lose front tire will you go without a
tire<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.950> keeps<00:01:32.159> going
