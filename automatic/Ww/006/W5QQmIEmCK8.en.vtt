knife it was still rack cutlery there

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
knife it was still rack cutlery there
you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.600> mine's<00:00:37.290> pretty<00:00:37.559> well<00:00:37.829> used

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you can see mine's pretty well used

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
you can see mine's pretty well used
you'll<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> my

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
you'll see that a lot with a lot of my

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.020 
you'll see that a lot with a lot of my
knives<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> they're<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:40.920> used<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
knives that they're very well used but I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
knives that they're very well used but I
think<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> adds<00:00:42.540> character<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> blade<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
think it adds character to the blade so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
think it adds character to the blade so

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.159 
about fifteen dollars I have not bought
them<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:37.210> had<00:04:37.360> time<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.810> option<00:04:38.110> is

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
them but had time that option is

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.890 
them but had time that option is
available<00:04:38.290> I've<00:04:38.680> heard<00:04:38.830> they're<00:04:39.010> really<00:04:39.370> nice

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
available I've heard they're really nice

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.110 
available I've heard they're really nice
but<00:04:40.900> anyway<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:41.980> yeah<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.460> ergonomics<00:04:43.000> on

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
but anyway so yeah so the ergonomics on

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.260 
but anyway so yeah so the ergonomics on
this<00:04:43.240> night<00:04:43.390> for<00:04:43.540> good<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.830> carves<00:04:45.270> pretty

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
this night for good it carves pretty

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.360 
this night for good it carves pretty
well<00:04:46.510> if<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.620> did<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:47.980> little<00:04:48.160> bit<00:04:48.340> of

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
well if you did a little bit of

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.850 
well if you did a little bit of
reprofiling<00:04:48.760> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> blade<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.870> mean<00:04:50.800> you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
reprofiling on the blade I mean you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.080 
reprofiling on the blade I mean you
could<00:04:51.010> probably<00:04:51.040> get<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.490> carve<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:52.000> little

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
could probably get it to carve a little

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.930 
could probably get it to carve a little
bit<00:04:52.300> better<00:04:52.390> it<00:04:53.140> does<00:04:53.470> have<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:55.270> little<00:04:56.110> bit<00:04:56.380> of

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
bit better it does have a little bit of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.280 
bit better it does have a little bit of
jumping<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.330> that's<00:04:58.960> not<00:04:59.110> super

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
jumping on it that's not super

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.930 
jumping on it that's not super
aggressive<00:04:59.710> jumping<00:05:00.010> but<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.280> can<00:05:00.490> lock<00:05:00.730> in

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
aggressive jumping but it can lock in

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.810 
aggressive jumping but it can lock in
your<00:05:00.970> finger<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.770> generally<00:05:02.770> find<00:05:02.979> when<00:05:03.640> I'm

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
your finger I generally find when I'm

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.520 
your finger I generally find when I'm
carving<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.630> want<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.840> use<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.050> tip<00:05:05.260> I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
carving and I want to use the tip I

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.920 
carving and I want to use the tip I
actually<00:05:06.130> less<00:05:06.460> my<00:05:06.640> thumb<00:05:06.880> up<00:05:07.090> here<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.600> do

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
actually less my thumb up here and do

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.980 
actually less my thumb up here and do
tip<00:05:08.140> work<00:05:08.350> rather<00:05:08.560> than<00:05:08.740> down<00:05:09.010> here<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:10.150> it

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
tip work rather than down here but it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.360 
tip work rather than down here but it
can<00:05:11.050> facilitate<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:12.010> either<00:05:12.160> way<00:05:14.669> let's<00:05:15.669> see

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
can facilitate it either way let's see

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.640 
can facilitate it either way let's see
but<00:05:18.370> awning<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:18.970> does<00:05:19.180> okay<00:05:19.990> it's<00:05:20.290> not<00:05:20.500> the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
but awning it does okay it's not the

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.200 
but awning it does okay it's not the
best<00:05:20.830> but<00:05:20.979> on<00:05:21.190> knife<00:05:21.430> because<00:05:21.610> it's<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:21.940> short

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
best but on knife because it's so short

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.240 
best but on knife because it's so short
but<00:05:22.479> for<00:05:22.990> its<00:05:23.110> size<00:05:23.290> does<00:05:23.850> relatively<00:05:24.850> well

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
but for its size does relatively well

just general purpose EDC tasks it picks

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.540 
just general purpose EDC tasks it picks
sells<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.669> lot<00:05:30.780> much<00:05:31.780> better<00:05:32.110> than<00:05:32.550> most

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
sells a lot much better than most

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.270 
sells a lot much better than most
folders<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.330> you'll<00:05:34.479> find<00:05:34.810> because<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.250> a

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
folders that you'll find because it is a

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.600 
folders that you'll find because it is a
fixed<00:05:36.610> blade<00:05:36.850> so<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.240> lot<00:05:37.360> stronger<00:05:38.610> has

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
fixed blade so it's a lot stronger has

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.700 
fixed blade so it's a lot stronger has
an<00:05:39.880> offensive<00:05:40.540> or<00:05:40.690> defensive<00:05:40.720> blade<00:05:41.470> I

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
an offensive or defensive blade I

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.450 
an offensive or defensive blade I
wouldn't<00:05:43.560> generally<00:05:44.560> employ<00:05:44.890> it<00:05:45.070> like<00:05:45.280> that

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
wouldn't generally employ it like that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.190 
wouldn't generally employ it like that
unless<00:05:45.700> you<00:05:46.000> were<00:05:46.120> trained<00:05:46.450> because<00:05:46.870> the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
unless you were trained because the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.290 
unless you were trained because the
shortness<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.620> blade<00:05:47.919> does<00:05:48.700> give<00:05:49.090> you<00:05:49.210> a

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
shortness of blade does give you a

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.780 
shortness of blade does give you a
severe<00:05:49.660> reach<00:05:49.960> disadvantage<00:05:50.280> but<00:05:51.280> generally

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
severe reach disadvantage but generally

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.540 
severe reach disadvantage but generally
I<00:05:51.940> look<00:05:52.180> at<00:05:52.300> my<00:05:52.419> knives<00:05:52.660> as<00:05:53.250> utility<00:05:54.250> tools

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
I look at my knives as utility tools

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.820 
I look at my knives as utility tools
rather<00:05:55.450> than<00:05:55.990> self-defense<00:05:56.830> tools<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.830> yeah

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
rather than self-defense tools so yeah

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.170 
rather than self-defense tools so yeah
this<00:06:00.070> has<00:06:00.250> been<00:06:00.460> my<00:06:00.640> review<00:06:00.700> I<00:06:01.210> hope<00:06:02.010> to<00:06:03.180> review
