00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 webber to guys here and you healthy and there 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.080
 I apologize if for these three days 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.900
 I didn't make videos but I was very 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
 busy with the extra school as if 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.179
 not enough a mess happened 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 in the meantime I'll show you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 which I am now having commented in 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.630
 live normally first recorded and then 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.160
 I did the audio commentary say we do 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.789
 all together because it is a solution of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.980
 emergency 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.800
 meanwhile I start practically scared 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 success that must be that light of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.500
 fifa game had some bugs there 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.469
 some mistakes and I practically since 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 second day after I had done the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.309
 new coaching mode with udinese 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.649
 the one we carried out in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 these first seven episodes from the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 career mode 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.399
 the console practically froze 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.699
 every time I loaded the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.090
 rescue and me to solve later 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.660
 practically shut down the modem every 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.399
 Once you start, your career flies 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.790
 practically loading the last one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.530
 rescue I have to disconnect the internet and then 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.909
 reattach it and this was already one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.780
 breaking of his boxes 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.370
 but in the end I said rather than 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.030
 stop me 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.100
 do it again, now I started 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.920
 the episodes with you and then I have 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.970
 said okay does nothing 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 will mean that I always play with 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.010
 the internet disconnected and already this was a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.500
 a bit more effort than that success 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.020
 now the new update has been released 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.930
 scared that he fixed this problem 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.540
 but evidently seen that mine 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.840
 my rescue coach mode 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.060
 I pretty much had the problem 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.010
 skype or downloaded update are 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.500
 gone now I'll show you up 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.610
 career career career where to you 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.210
 bailouts and as you will see there is no longer the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.540
 rescue ie I was canceled on 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.680
 rescue called fifa it 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.360
 the one with our career mode 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.130
 as you can see I also click on Arabs 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.770
 update see below left 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.540
 loading bar but it is gone 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.830
 anything 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.010
 I am very sorry for this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.600
 because that is, I understand that for you it could 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.400
 be a loss of patience e 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.140
 certainly it was for me too 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.780
 when I first noticed it 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.830
 and it is above all a pity because it was 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.050
 a mess 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.030
 almost two months of career mode e 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.180
 the idea of ​​having to interrupt like this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.580
 abruptly surely breaks the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.510
 enthusiasms and curiosities that were there 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.090
 around the episodes that were taking place 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.860
 loading then I hope you 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 especially due to the fact that it happened 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.340
 this very big misunderstanding 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.050
 you will be even closer to me and fifa it 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.360
 with the support with i like with i 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.360
 comments I promise you that in return 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.530
 especially in these early days I will do 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.610
 one video a day and every day after 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.100
 below the video I put in the comments of the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.110
 specific requests for advice on what 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.890
 you want to see ie for example now vi 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.320
 I say 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.290
 at this moment that having to do it again 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.670
 I again accept all kinds of advice 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 from your part 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.459
 if for example redo it with the Udine 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.470
 same or if you do it with a team 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.239
 English or if he is a team member 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.010
 standard b and attempt to climb to 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.780
 A league 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.910
 or if they talk 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.750
 I know with a team of many 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.940
 money and dream team what 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.410
 you want me to recommend you for this 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.090
 video I tell you recommend me more than 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.760
 the other team I'll put you maybe 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 different abc options to say 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.700
 and you commented by writing aboc 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.590
 I collect the comments and redo the 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.420
 mother coach who according to yours 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.770
 tips and obvious that then I will not 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.480
 wait I will not run 3 4 days to 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.200
 the second episode if not it is obvious that 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.080
 then afterwards there is also the desire here 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.459
 so I'll try these first faces in 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.590
 these first times to do every day 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.010
 the episode so that we share in 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.019
 hurry and then later once started 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.340
 let's pretend it wasn't there 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.650
 this ugly misunderstanding is nothing 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.780
 we will go on our way 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.720
 so I hope this video you 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.470
 all seen because it is very important 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.700
 unfortunately it happens that this was useless 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.600
 pretend nothing happened 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.520
 or try to create a mode 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.060
 coach of doing all their own 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.590
 passages for two months of play so 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.870
 to make you believe that it had not happened 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.700
 nothing I tell you how things are and 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.390
 that is, that there was this error of 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.860
 game that but removed all the saves 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.570
 and so now I look forward to and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.000
 yours your advice 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.039
 then we start our new new one 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.320
 coach mode with the promise that 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.440
 this time both as speed of 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.380
 loading is as we say listening to i 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.390
 your advice I will be much more open and 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.450
 so ask me any advice on 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.040
 what players to buy that information 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.800
 use all these things here so that 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.540
 you too will feel more part of the 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.700
 so I greet you with this project e 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.670
 I hope you can see this 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.530
 video all by tonight maximum tomorrow 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.930
 morning so that already tomorrow 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.560
 afternoon we can start the new one 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.520
 project with this is everything and I'm sorry 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.140
 still for this misunderstanding you don't know 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.270
 however the regret I had 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.710
 when I first saw it not 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.550
 there were more bailouts because anyway 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.160
 I began to grow fond of making videos 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.620
 and to have your feedback though 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.230
 this does not mean that those with your 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.360
 aid will not be able to redo this thing and 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.040
 so I repeat with this is all ea 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.040
 tomorrow to the next
