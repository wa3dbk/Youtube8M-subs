00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 channel in the info box we decided to 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
 make this video together in which 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.450
 We will list 10 products under 10 euros 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.340
 more used in this month then 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.820
 I'm curious to see even toys 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.590
 sanction maybe you also tell me which ones 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.960
 products you have used more in 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.110
 this month that go under 10 euros 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.329
 start immediately with the base with a beautiful 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.460
 corrector and this one of the 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.260
 maybelline canceled and you can too 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.579
 see how much is consumed here and is 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.600
 at a cost of 590 or if I don't remember 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.300
 anyway certainly on 13 euros that this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.730
 corrector here that really looks a lot 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.550
 silky on the skin and precisely all the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.630
 clear that they are the most delicate part 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:15.640
 I face and I find really well I'm a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 bit the color is one more point than the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.160
 my skin color then the next 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.820
 once I will have to buy it is clear in 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.010
 this was the second tone and therefore 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.390
 even that tax we pass to the base 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.790
 eyes and as a base or I'm really sending 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.020
 this one by kiko really enhances the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.729
 color of 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.969
 I really did some eye shadows 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.090
 very much and especially in special 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:47.469
 way those to free dust or eye shadow 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.670
 compact, very good, and this is it 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.250
 council 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 another product that I appreciated 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:00.549
 I used a lot this month 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:03.069

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.049
 illuminating a snatt 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:11.380
 and it is this fishing that goes to some rhyme 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:15.040

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.660
 however, he will never really see anyway 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.590
 amazed by this product because yours 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.019
 heaven for four five months and still is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.870
 still fresh but still not dry 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.870
 and I applied it in the inner corner 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.480
 of the eye to illuminate in all 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:41.590
 eyeshadows I used remained very 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.870
 very astonished and for this month the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.359

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:53.769
 this is the grain number 208 here 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 and it is this colors fir is a color 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.389
 dark brown but on one side and a 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.480
 brownish shimmer all brinosa 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.730
 on the other hand it is very much used 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.130
 in fact, this month you can almost see the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.160
 scaling another product instead of 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.190
 I used in combination with 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.580
 the fig umbrella was always a 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.210
 cream eye shadow that this cone choc 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.620
 and it was really mine for me 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.280
 salvation or my god 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.200
 ok, kind of melted everything on the side 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.330
 now I have to melt it again 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.470
 still very very very good 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.860
 pigmented a good duration up to 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.710
 evening I put it in the morning and then 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.430
 that was to say it ended up being 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.660
 the make-up in the evening was 104 very much 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.510
 another new product that I have 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.430
 purchased this month and that anyway 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.440
 used that all month and this 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.350
 eyeliner here of the easy pay that I am 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.110
 however applying and always with the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.450
 brush that of the color trend and me 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.700
 I find it really good I have to be 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.640
 sincere you see even today I applied it 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.810
 and I'm really very satisfied with 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.020
 these of these eyeliner though 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.320
 they are cheap even if the post makes it 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.880
 very much another more used product 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.220
 this month was this pencil 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.910
 white and of the headquarters the 20 that is 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.460
 practically the pencil I use for 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.770
 enlarge mine my eye that I put 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.790
 below very very valid and writing 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.950
 especially another of the products that 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.040
 used the most was this was 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.610
 mascara here that the 360 ​​degrees that lajolo 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:54.190
 and longwell 360 degree waterproof mascara 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.260
 and very very good I applied it 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.270
 when I had physical education at school 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.720
 is 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.400
 I always found myself very well too 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.040
 because it does not melt if it is removed 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.540
 great with any say 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.900
 makeup remover even in the shower does not go 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.400
 away think and for those make-up remover c 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.190
 very very strange I'm done that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.420
 however I am very well and this 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.590
 however less than 10 euros 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.320
 I think the team costs very well the three 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.650
 products there are two pencils or rather three 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.140
 pencils a long lasting stica shadow a 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.570
 me if you can call it pencil this is 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:42.190
 the other asks me for this purple color 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.320
 I applied again today and I am 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.560
 really very well see color 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.210
 very good and very pigmented it costs 3 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.220
 euro and 94 was 90 and I am 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.580
 wonderfully even with all the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.480
 other pencils always stick to this one 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.860
 line here very long lasting a lot 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.440
 also good in duration that I recommend 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.340
 strongly to take some color 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.570
 because once they are put to work 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.040
 go away 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.790
 another purple hand I applied 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.510
 below and we create it you know you think of the most 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:28.390
 think again of the violet and of the 406 a pencil 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:31.300
 eyes simple and normal but applied 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.350
 below or even inside the 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.910
 before the eye really makes a 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.890
 beautiful effect because then also 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.320
 those for the sciences a bit harsher 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.770
 that I like a lot and this me 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.490
