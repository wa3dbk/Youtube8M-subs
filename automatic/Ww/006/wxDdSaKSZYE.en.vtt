00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
 Maria Bonikou 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.120
 You did try at least. Better than him there the whisper. 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.980
 Wolverine! Come and help us! I've never been Christmas again, never with you. 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.600
 You could sing the male part in the "triangle carols". 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.100
 Cyclops ... is ... facing a problem. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.220
 Oh! But why ; 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.440
 Come on ! Do not worry about me sweet! 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.840
 They do not like the celebrations to the old - Logan. 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.440
 I never had a star like this! 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.320
 These are your first Christmas with us and we want you to be special. 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.120
 You did it already. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 The storm and I will go to the city for shopping. Come with us ! 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.460
 Come on, come on! For me ! 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.260
 Well, do not you like it at all? 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 So far I have never bought gifts for friends ever. It's very nice ! 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.780
 Thank you for coming with me, Walter! You say I got, enough? 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.760
 Do I have to take a few things for the Christmas dinner? 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.000
 You know, it's the first time I do Christmas, along with some like a family 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 I'm not sure what to do ... 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.480
 Come on, now, Welsh ... Christmas we have, have fun a bit. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.040
 Will it take us a long time? 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.140
 In an hour, we have Christmas dinner. Others will worry about us. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.740
 This is your Christmas dinner? 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760
 Well, how do these people live? They have nothing. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.200
 So, our glorious leader decided to visit us after so long. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 Is this a Christmas visit? 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.920
 Or did you come to see a Morclock suffer? 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.660
 This is your right, but for us you have never been a leader. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.720
 Here you go. So it started. 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.260
 What is ; What happens ; Why are you sitting here, like an iceberg over there? 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 Why do not you get him to do something? 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 It had to be better now. Why did not he succeed? 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 Tell us quickly. Will he eventually live? 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.260
 Then he tried something else! It is assumed that you are a doctor. 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.260
 Will he not survive? 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.420
 Leeds ... No! No, it can not ! 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.500
 Not today ! It's Christmas Eve! 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 Wolfgang ... Please ... You know, you can cure yourself. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 Can not help Leeds? 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.860
 You have to try Walter! You always help someone in need. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.240
 Do you believe Marianna miracles at all? 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.220
 Perhaps, perhaps a little to see one. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.300
 (Relief) Marianna is good! Are well ! 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.420
 As the Morclock leader, I openly invite all of the He-Men 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 to honor us with their presence at the Christmas dinner. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.020
 I'm even leaving professors. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.980
 Data is out of balance. Our world is under siege. 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.020
 No ! What martyrdom is this? 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.400
 No . Please . Get out! 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.540
 It was no dream at all. Shadow King has come into our minds. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.240
 Logan, what's wrong with you? Tell us.. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.840
 Professors ... Professors we need your help. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.360
 The struggles and all our struggles are now past, now Charles. 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.940
 Head the forest is full of traps! Look... 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.020
 Jenny seemed upset when she left for this I followed her ... I found this. 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.200
 Oh my little one ... I hope to follow the right way to get you home. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.220
 But is not there a way to tell me that? 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.680
 Be brave now. I promise to take you to your mother in every way. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.900
 Oh, the sun is starting to go ... 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.320
 It will begin to darken soon. Winnipeg will be nervous. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.920
 I know he'll put my voices anyway. 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.940
 I'm better on my own. 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.300
 All of them have probably forgotten me. 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.240
 Oh, I'm all alone ... No one wants me ... 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.080
 You are my one and only friend. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.920
 What happens ; Where are you going ; 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.080
 Oh! It's your mother, the one who yells at you. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.400
 Okay, go back to your mom but watch this time, right? 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.460
 Watch the traps, okay? Goodbye and watch them. 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.420
 Aaaaa !! 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.860
 Where am I ; 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.940
 I guess I must have fallen, quite high up. 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 You stayed ... To watch me, eh? Correctly ; 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.360
 Oh, I knew you would not leave me! You are the only true friend I have! 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.620
 Haha, you came back! So you did not do it to me! 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.620
 What's up ; 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.980
 Robben, Will! Winnipeg, Marion, Tac! Did you all come for me? 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.000
 Oh, at last! Leti, tell me, what are you doing here? 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.300
 What did you rehearse? 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.040
 Of course! Do not be afraid that you are beautiful! 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.200
 Not anymore . Look Lady, you're dazzling. 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.720
 There is no return. 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.700
 What matters now is that you are a woman who loves ... 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.720
 And he loves Leth ... 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.760
 Your new louk just reflects your inner change. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.880
 Guillermo ... I'm very pleased to find you. 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.880
 Yes, something terrible has happened. 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.000
 No no no . This is not Natalia. 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.700
 Mild . I think it crazed! I told you that this was going to happen. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.940
 Please take the little one with you. You are the only one left to her. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.680
 Yes? Staying quiet? Okay ; 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 Pia sent them to an institution! 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.400
 (They went) To the road ... If you find them, get them! 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.540
 Pia, crazy my child! Run fast, please! Save the children! 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.320
 Why ... (Hitting) Open me the door. 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.340
 Open me, the door, right now! Open me! 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.040
 What are you doing ; What smell is this? 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.680
 Paraffin oil !! Here, open me! 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.240
 Open the door ! For the name of God! 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.300
 Why, open me, my child, oh !! 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.800
 Open me, Pia! 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.640
 Do not make my child madness ... 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.300
 Think, Natalia! Do not do, no stupidity! 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.720
 Too bad, these witches stole the "book of life". 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.200
 Where will we now write our memories? 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.820
 Where is Maria ; Was not he with you? 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.440
 Where is Mary, children? 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.100
 Dear Dad, 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.680
 I want to tell you that here we are not doing well. 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.500
 They even tried to get my cars ... 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.320
 But I do not care. 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.840
 Because I know, it's better to have friends than cars. 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.620
 Friends, it's with you when you're afraid. 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.580
 You can do, bitch with them. 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.860
 And if you hungry, they give you half their apple. 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.420
 Even if they have nothing else. 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.420
 Oh, that's why I'm happy! And another dad ... 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.940
 I wanted to tell you that although many things went wrong for us 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.880
 I never drank my bed. I probably grew up! 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.700
 I hope to meet again soon ... 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.280
 I love you a lot ... Agustin. 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.340
 Not Sebastien, it's definitely good. I'm sure ! It's good for you. 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.600
 Agustin is right. 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.700
 I know her Maria. He will fight to turn again, near us.
