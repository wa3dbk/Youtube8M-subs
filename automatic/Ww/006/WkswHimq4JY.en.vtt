00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.900
 today he has called a boy saying that 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.820
 has a brings from 67 I do not know much about 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.820
 motorcycles but I thought it would be the good 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.890
 very well 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.320
 hello happy to talk about the bike is 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.700
 one brings a bonneville from 67 I bought it 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.880
 with my mother and was left in the storage room 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.619
 for years I want to sell it because 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.600
 I want to help my mother in the 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.000
 reforms of his house help his mother 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.559
 to fix the house who would not want to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.809
 we bought it from a guy who had 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.900
 brought from california inspired by the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.500
 biker gang scorpio rivals 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.570
 Hells Angels seriously all 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.809
 the pieces are original does not carry 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.970
 speedometer or odometer 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.949
 intermittent for a real biker not 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.350
 it matters how many kilometers you have just 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 those that remain to be traveled 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.780
 what is good since chlorine works 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.790
 if it works to potential buyers 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.720
 I can tell you that I've tried it and it's going 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.820
 well and has started the first between 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.380
 1956 and 1970 all the fringes of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.940
 two-wheeled speed they beat with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 triumph motorcycles 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.430
 I'm sorry it's selling but it's to help 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 to my mother 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.830
 how much you want for her would be great 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 ten thousand dollars 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.590
 the bike is beautiful I think it will be sold 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.180
 very well I will call an expert so that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.590
 I explained a couple of things and so that 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.390
 see if it's worth the money you expect 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.159
 I need an expert to tell me if the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.289
 Price is reasonable in the current market 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.360
 because once it goes to auction it will have 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.429
 to settle for what they pay him is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.649
 one brings a front 67 I do not know much more 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.500
 because they are called chopper the chopper 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.420
 they are a product of the 60's people 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.759
 he bought a motorcycle, he took almost everything 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.890
 the original equipment added the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.140
 giant forks seats and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.020
 they developed their own bike a lot 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.030
 means to cut out the name like that 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.830
 that is personalized in the 60 years the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.409
 original structure goes from here towards 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 here the structure was cut out and removed 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.220
 the standard ones use an angle of 28 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 here we have one of about 38 degrees the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.349
 shoppers were looking for the freedom of 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.380
 expression by their bikes and they drove 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.560
 some incredible vehicles do not always 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.930
 they improved but they customized them for 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.960
 that were unique when it can be worth 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.180
 it depends on who is pushing 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.340
 already of the desire that you have could be 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.470
 get someone's attention with money 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 totally or you go out in sing those people 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.170
 I think something like that would have to be worth 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.090
 at least eight thousand or about twelve thousand if 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.060
 we had in the store would cost the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.860
 minus twelve thousand a fair price a price 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.380
 just in an auction is different from the one in 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.210
 sale for sale could reach between 8 and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.190
 12 thousand dollars but the people who carry 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.620
 your objects to an auction is guaranteed 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.480
 the sale hopefully we can reach 10 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.820
 a thousand dollars does not look bad 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.440
 beautiful I love 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.600
 I'm also a scorpio and here he puts 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.030
 scorpion thank you for your time and 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.460
 knowledge I appreciate it value 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.440
 estimated eight thousand to 12 thousand dollars see 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.200
 how many do we get out is a work of 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.629
 art I would place it on the wall 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.140
 if they sell the bike for 10,000 or more and I 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.580
 he scored a dance this vaudeville 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.739
 completely restored is inspired 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.629
 in easy rider when they took the bike 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.920
 I was with my family and my daughter told me 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.989
 I was shaking 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.599
 it's the best way to describe it because 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.060
 I was like I had a bid 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.930
 phone call for her just before 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.510
 that they started 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.209
 we have three thousand five hundred 3500 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.150
 We look for 4004 with few cows what 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.980
 it's okay because it attracts more people 4500 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.569
 we have five thousand we have five thousand 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.269
 we have five thousand and six thousand dollars 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.090

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.219

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.519

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:01.819

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.370
 I expected to get about 10,000 for 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.099
 help a little more to my mother of 73 years 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.620
 I put things for the house that I like 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.630
 a little disappointed work pusher 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.000
 telephone has done a good business with 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.479
 the bike thought it would sell for a long time 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.259
 plus 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.479
 he first loved getting it for 7 thousand 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.979
 searching by phone is a rush because 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.979
 the client can do a good business 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.860
 sold for seven thousand dollars
