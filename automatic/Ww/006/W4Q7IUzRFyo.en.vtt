00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
hypocritical at all no I mean you can

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.480 
hypocritical at all no I mean you can
you<00:01:20.569> can<00:01:20.749> make<00:01:21.229> some<00:01:21.439> criticisms<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.249> want

you can make some criticisms if you want

you can make some criticisms if you want
but<00:01:22.700> I<00:01:22.759> think<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:23.299> should<00:01:23.479> probably<00:01:23.869> be

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
but I think that we should probably be

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.809 
but I think that we should probably be
applauding<00:01:24.530> these<00:01:24.649> people<00:01:25.009> who<00:01:25.100> stood<00:01:25.429> up<00:01:25.609> and

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
applauding these people who stood up and

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.929 
applauding these people who stood up and
took<00:01:25.999> a<00:01:26.060> stand<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:27.289> fight<00:01:28.130> climate<00:01:28.369> change<00:01:28.579> and

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
took a stand to fight climate change and

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.129 
took a stand to fight climate change and
to<00:01:29.060> make<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.270> country<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.840> world<00:01:29.960> a

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
to make the country in the world a

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.389 
to make the country in the world a
better<00:01:30.170> place<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.859> do<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.009> buy<00:01:31.219> into

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
better place so do you buy into

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.819 
better place so do you buy into
indulgences<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.509> mean<00:01:33.289> I'm<00:01:33.409> sorry<00:01:33.619> I'm<00:01:33.710> sorry

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
indulgences I mean I'm sorry I'm sorry

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.969 
indulgences I mean I'm sorry I'm sorry
I'm<00:01:34.009> not<00:01:34.130> indulgence<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.819> offsets<00:01:35.950> yeah<00:01:36.950> i

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
I'm not indulgence is offsets yeah i

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.649 
I'm not indulgence is offsets yeah i
think<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.310> offsets<00:01:37.819> are<00:01:37.939> probably<00:01:38.329> a<00:01:38.389> nice

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
think that offsets are probably a nice

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.450 
think that offsets are probably a nice
gesture<00:01:39.049> but<00:01:39.259> they're<00:01:39.590> they're<00:01:40.159> more<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
gesture but they're they're more of a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.249 
gesture but they're they're more of a
distraction<00:01:40.639> than<00:01:41.119> anything<00:01:41.689> else<00:01:41.840> don't<00:01:42.200> you

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
distraction than anything else don't you

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.309 
distraction than anything else don't you
find<00:01:42.439> them<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.829> be<00:01:42.859> I<00:01:43.369> mean<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.450> was<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.600> Freudian

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
find them to be I mean it was a Freudian

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.959 
find them to be I mean it was a Freudian
slip<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.859> call<00:01:46.009> them<00:01:46.159> indulgences<00:01:46.819> I

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
slip there to call them indulgences I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.099 
slip there to call them indulgences I
mean<00:01:47.119> that's<00:01:47.209> what<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.600> Catholic<00:01:47.929> Church<00:01:48.079> was

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
mean that's what the Catholic Church was

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.959 
mean that's what the Catholic Church was

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
selling for forgiveness well you just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.639 
selling for forgiveness well you just
pay<00:01:50.329> me<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:50.630> money<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.109> then<00:01:51.200> we'll<00:01:51.380> forgive

pay me this money and then we'll forgive
it<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:51.889> it<00:01:51.979> doesn't<00:01:52.249> really<00:01:52.310> change<00:01:52.429> anything

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
it and it doesn't really change anything

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.109 
it and it doesn't really change anything
I<00:01:53.299> mean<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.319> as<00:01:54.920> an<00:01:55.219> environmentalist

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
I mean is that as an environmentalist

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.480 
I mean is that as an environmentalist
when<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.779> look<00:01:56.990> at<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.200> list<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.950> where

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
when you look at the list of the where

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.919 
when you look at the list of the where
is<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.789> four<00:01:59.060> things<00:01:59.329> or<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> seven

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
is it the four things or the seven

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.080 
is it the four things or the seven
things<00:02:00.139> they<00:02:00.380> ask<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.859> to<00:02:01.009> do<00:02:01.189> they<00:02:01.789> ask<00:02:01.939> you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
things they ask you to do they ask you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.330 
things they ask you to do they ask you
to<00:02:02.179> change<00:02:02.420> for<00:02:02.959> incandescent<00:02:03.560> light<00:02:04.039> bulbs

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.429 
and use take public transport or carpool
at<00:02:10.939> least<00:02:10.970> once<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.450> week<00:02:11.599> there's<00:02:12.049> nowhere<00:02:12.379> in

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
at least once a week there's nowhere in

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.320 
at least once a week there's nowhere in
here<00:02:12.650> about

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
here about

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.400 
here about
vegetarianism<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.660> anything<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
vegetarianism or anything like that that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.860 
vegetarianism or anything like that that
would<00:02:16.590> make<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> real<00:02:17.490> impact<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
would make a real impact on the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.350 
would make a real impact on the
environment<00:02:19.580> yeah<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.090> if

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
environment yeah and I think that if

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.060 
environment yeah and I think that if
there's<00:02:21.630> criticisms<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> concert<00:02:22.860> it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
there's criticisms of the concert it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.680 
there's criticisms of the concert it
could<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> focus<00:02:24.060> could<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
could be that the focus could be on the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.030 
could be that the focus could be on the
things<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.020> matter<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.410> most<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
things that matter the most but I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.380 
things that matter the most but I
wouldn't<00:02:26.340> criticize<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> artist<00:02:27.270> who

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
wouldn't criticize the artist who

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.390 
wouldn't criticize the artist who
performs<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.170> think<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.770> most<00:02:28.890> important

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
performs I think the most important

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.980 
performs I think the most important
thing<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.700> focus<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.390> biggest<00:02:30.600> sources

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
thing is to focus on the biggest sources

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.260 
thing is to focus on the biggest sources
of<00:02:31.140> greenhouse<00:02:31.410> gases<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.340> cars<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.880> coal

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
of greenhouse gases like cars and coal

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.660 
of greenhouse gases like cars and coal
what<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> true<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.010> Mike<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.490> you've

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
what is it true but Mike see you've

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.050 
what is it true but Mike see you've
bought<00:02:36.000> into<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.990> is<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.610> main

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
bought into it that is not the the main

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.630 
bought into it that is not the the main
cause<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.870> animal<00:02:40.470> gases<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.460> it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
cause it is animal gases that it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.450 
cause it is animal gases that it
produces<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.420> co2<00:02:42.720> than<00:02:43.050> any<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> cars

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
produces more co2 than any of the cars

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.030 
produces more co2 than any of the cars
that<00:02:44.580> were<00:02:44.820> driving<00:02:45.500> sounds<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.650> bunch<00:02:46.890> of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that were driving sounds like a bunch of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.320 
that were driving sounds like a bunch of
bull<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> me<00:02:47.520> Glenn<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
bull to me Glenn I think that the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210 
bull to me Glenn I think that the
biggest<00:02:48.510> source<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.200> greenhouse<00:02:49.410> gases<00:02:50.040> it's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
biggest source of greenhouse gases it's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.400 
biggest source of greenhouse gases it's
it's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.730> fact<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.210> coal<00:02:51.510> coal<00:02:51.900> fired<00:02:52.170> power

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
it's a fact is coal coal fired power

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.470 
it's a fact is coal coal fired power
plants<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> points<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.270> platform

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
plants one of the points in the platform

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.500 
plants one of the points in the platform
is<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.500> enact<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.580> moratorium<00:02:56.850> on<00:02:57.330> new

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
is to enact a moratorium on new

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.050 
is to enact a moratorium on new
coal-fired<00:02:57.750> power<00:02:58.290> which<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.490> me<00:02:59.610> seems<00:02:59.880> like

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
coal-fired power which to me seems like

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
coal-fired power which to me seems like
the<00:03:00.180> best<00:03:00.330> way<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.600> go<00:03:00.840> because<00:03:01.080> we<00:03:02.040> can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the best way to go because we can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.860 
the best way to go because we can
produce<00:03:02.400> clean<00:03:02.790> energy<00:03:03.210> or<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.600> save

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
produce clean energy or we can save

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.270 
produce clean energy or we can save
energy<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.440> not<00:03:04.530> produce<00:03:04.770> any<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
energy and not produce any of the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970 
energy and not produce any of the
pollution<00:03:05.580> are<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.240> for<00:03:06.630> nuclear<00:03:06.990> power<00:03:07.230> no

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
pollution are you for nuclear power no

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.190 
pollution are you for nuclear power no
of<00:03:08.190> course<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.460> of<00:03:09.030> course<00:03:09.270> not<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.840> mean<00:03:10.080> it's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
of course not of course not I mean it's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.600 
of course not of course not I mean it's
clean<00:03:10.380> energy<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.920> course<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> wouldn't<00:03:11.430> be

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
clean energy of course you wouldn't be

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.120 
clean energy of course you wouldn't be

nuclear<00:03:14.970> energy<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.540> everybody<00:03:16.350> loves

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
nuclear energy is everybody loves

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.350 
nuclear energy is everybody loves
friends<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.160> clean<00:03:17.490> energy<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.090> don't

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
friends it's clean energy if you don't

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.940 
friends it's clean energy if you don't
factor<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.140> threat<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.620> nuclear

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
factor in the threat of nuclear

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
do to a nuclear power plant okay the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.260 
do to a nuclear power plant okay the
best<00:03:24.810> way<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.110> produce<00:03:25.470> energy<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:27.000> by

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
best way to produce energy is is by
