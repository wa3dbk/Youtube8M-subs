called<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> polarizer<00:00:38.149> then<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> on

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
called the polarizer then you use it on

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.209 
called the polarizer then you use it on
the<00:00:40.260> door<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.420> pipe<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.079> open<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the door and then the pipe will open and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
the door and then the pipe will open and
it's<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> door<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> goes<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.890> an<00:00:46.890> obstacle

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's a door and it goes into an obstacle

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.959 
it's a door and it goes into an obstacle
course<00:00:47.719> we're<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.110> hard<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> complete<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
course we're very hard to complete but

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.100 
course we're very hard to complete but
it's<00:00:51.180> definitely<00:00:51.660> worth<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:53.960> nothing<00:00:54.960> today

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it's definitely worth it nothing today

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.770 
it's definitely worth it nothing today
it's<00:00:55.230> Rhyno<00:00:55.710> v3<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.750> don't<00:01:02.180> we<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.390> fly

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's Rhyno v3 so we don't we just fly

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.100 
it's Rhyno v3 so we don't we just fly
through<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.320> part

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.800 

it's<00:01:09.680> not<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:09.890> hard<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:11.450> there's<00:01:11.660> all

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you have to get a multiplier 12 times

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.920 
you have to get a multiplier 12 times
multiplier<00:01:40.160> 11<00:01:40.760> x<00:01:40.940> multiplied<00:01:41.479> or<00:01:41.540> something

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
all these boxes and then you scrunch in

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.920 
all these boxes and then you scrunch in
the<00:02:35.060> middle<00:02:35.680> may<00:02:36.680> all<00:02:36.860> come<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the middle may all come to you and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.110 
the middle may all come to you and
that's<00:02:38.930> how<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.800> then<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:42.200> use<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
that's how you do it and then you use a

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.500 
that's how you do it and then you use a
teleporter<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.240> get<00:02:44.390> back<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.840> ship<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
teleporter to get back to your ship and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.070 
teleporter to get back to your ship and
from<00:02:47.510> then<00:02:47.750> on<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:49.430> use<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.270> teleporter

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
from then on you can use this teleporter

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.190 
from then on you can use this teleporter
to<00:02:51.440> get<00:02:51.590> there<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.250> two<00:02:52.850> there<00:02:52.880> from<00:02:53.840> here<00:02:54.020> to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
to get there and two there from here to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.750 
to get there and two there from here to
there<00:02:54.380> without<00:02:54.830> having<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> go<00:02:55.460> through<00:02:55.520> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
there without having to go through the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.910 
there without having to go through the
whole<00:02:55.850> obstacle<00:02:56.060> course<00:02:56.540> again<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.740> has

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
whole obstacle course again this has

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040 
whole obstacle course again this has
been<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.340> mystic<00:02:58.760> productions<00:02:59.360> see<00:02:59.990> you
