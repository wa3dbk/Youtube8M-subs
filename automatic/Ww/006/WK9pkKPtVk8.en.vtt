little<00:02:59.260> drop<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.500> oil<00:02:59.860> down<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.550> middle<00:03:00.790> of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
little drop of oil down the middle of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.030 
little drop of oil down the middle of
that<00:03:01.180> you'll<00:03:02.140> actually<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:02.890> wick

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that you'll actually have a little wick

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.100 
that you'll actually have a little wick
down<00:03:03.250> there<00:03:03.520> put<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:04.180> oil<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.840> place

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
down there put some oil in that place

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
down there put some oil in that place
and<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.470> will<00:03:05.590> draw<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.190> where<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.550> needs<00:03:06.760> to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
and it will draw it to where it needs to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.170 
and it will draw it to where it needs to
go<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.560> actually<00:03:08.860> back<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.030> this

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
go and so that is actually back to this

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.150 
go and so that is actually back to this
bobbin<00:03:10.630> case<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.380> see<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.680> really<00:03:12.010> large

directly<00:03:15.510> over<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.750> wick<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.290> just

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
directly over that wick that I just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.979 
directly over that wick that I just
added<00:03:17.709> oil<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.760> have<00:03:18.850> no<00:03:19.330> excuse

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
added oil to so you have no excuse

along<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:34.030> breaks<00:03:34.300> you've<00:03:34.510> all<00:03:34.630> been<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:35.080> it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
along it breaks you've all been there it

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.920 
along it breaks you've all been there it
will<00:03:35.920> usually<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:37.390> change<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.780> needle

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
will usually just change the needle

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.870 
will usually just change the needle
first<00:03:38.230> change<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> needle<00:03:39.220> where<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.730> go

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
first change the needle where you go

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.250 
first change the needle where you go
then<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.450> don't<00:03:40.600> have<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.810> stop<00:03:40.989> what<00:03:41.140> you're

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
then you don't have to stop what you're

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.449 
then you don't have to stop what you're
doing<00:03:41.500> but<00:03:41.620> towards<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.070> end<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.280> that

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
doing but towards the end of that

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.340 
doing but towards the end of that
project<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.090> need<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.480> probably<00:03:43.780> get<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.080> here

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350

and<00:03:44.500> clean<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.890> lint<00:03:45.070> out<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.090> be<00:03:46.180> one

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
and clean the lint out so it can be one

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.880 
and clean the lint out so it can be one
of<00:03:46.390> two<00:03:46.480> things<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.930> needles<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> easiest<00:03:47.709> to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
of two things the needles the easiest to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.800 
of two things the needles the easiest to
change<00:03:47.920> that's<00:03:48.370> why<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.580> do<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.910> first<00:03:49.239> but

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
change that's why I do that first but

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.990 
change that's why I do that first but

bobbins now if you're thinking about how
much<00:03:56.709> sewing<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.250> do<00:03:57.400> with<00:03:57.580> three<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.850> five

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000

bobbins<00:03:58.420> you're<00:03:58.570> going<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> realize<00:03:59.110> that<00:03:59.140> is

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
bobbins you're going to realize that is

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.430 
bobbins you're going to realize that is
a<00:03:59.590> lot<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:00.760> get<00:04:01.030> definitely<00:04:01.570> find<00:04:01.840> yourself<00:04:02.200> in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
a lot so get definitely find yourself in

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.199 
a lot so get definitely find yourself in
here<00:04:02.799> more<00:04:03.100> often<00:04:03.400> than<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.670> probably<00:04:03.850> have

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
here more often than you probably have

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.509 
here more often than you probably have
on<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.600> previous<00:04:04.810> machines<00:04:05.410> now<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.130> put

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
on your previous machines now to put

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.250 
on your previous machines now to put
this<00:04:06.640> all<00:04:06.820> back<00:04:06.940> together<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.540> is<00:04:07.690> key<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.110> get

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
this all back together it is key you get

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.620 
this all back together it is key you get

two places lined up first off these kind
of<00:04:10.720> pointy<00:04:11.110> ends<00:04:11.410> they<00:04:11.680> go<00:04:11.920> kind<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.459> towards

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940

going to see the second part that needs
to<00:04:27.340> line<00:04:27.490> up<00:04:27.669> right<00:04:28.060> down<00:04:28.210> here<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.630> bottom

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
to line up right down here at the bottom

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.960 
to line up right down here at the bottom
there's<00:04:29.140> like<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.290> little<00:04:29.470> heel<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.220> heel

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
there's like a little heel and that heel

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.150 
there's like a little heel and that heel
is<00:04:31.180> going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.390> be<00:04:31.510> on<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.870> left<00:04:32.440> side<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:33.040> this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
is going to be on the left side of this

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.910 
is going to be on the left side of this
spring<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.600> properly<00:04:35.350> positioned

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
spring and that is properly positioned

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.170 
spring and that is properly positioned
and<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.160> has<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> little<00:04:36.580> wiggle<00:04:36.850> that's

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
and it has a little wiggle that's

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.970 
and it has a little wiggle that's
perfect<00:04:37.630> there's<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.260> many<00:04:38.350> times<00:04:38.590> people<00:04:38.710> get

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
perfect there's so many times people get

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.370 
perfect there's so many times people get
it<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.270> opposite<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.720> where<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.110> little

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
it in opposite of where that little

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.080 
it in opposite of where that little
spring<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.370> well<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.060> just

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
spring is and that is well it just

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.970 
spring is and that is well it just
doesn't<00:04:43.360> work<00:04:43.660> all<00:04:44.410> right<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:44.830> make<00:04:44.950> sure

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
doesn't work all right so make sure

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.590 
doesn't work all right so make sure
you're<00:04:45.250> on<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:45.610> side<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:46.180> look<00:04:46.360> at<00:04:46.480> those

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
you're on this side you look at those

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.300 
you're on this side you look at those
arrows<00:04:46.960> look<00:04:47.290> at<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.500> little<00:04:47.710> spring<00:04:48.100> and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
arrows look at the little spring and

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.100 
arrows look at the little spring and
after<00:04:48.970> you've<00:04:49.090> cleaned<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.480> all<00:04:49.600> up<00:04:49.630> then

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
after you've cleaned it all up then

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.260 
after you've cleaned it all up then
you're<00:04:50.260> ready<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.680> assemble<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:51.850> all<00:04:52.090> you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.680 
time to go ahead and get things cleaned
and<00:05:14.220> perfect<00:05:15.220> might<00:05:15.790> as<00:05:15.880> well<00:05:16.030> start<00:05:16.300> off<00:05:16.480> with

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
and perfect might as well start off with

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.770 
and perfect might as well start off with
a<00:05:16.720> proper<00:05:17.650> needle<00:05:17.800> what<00:05:18.580> I'll<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.480> do<00:05:19.660> is

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
bring that all the way down to six

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.280 
bring that all the way down to six
o'clock<00:05:25.030> notice<00:05:25.450> sometimes<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.870> hold<00:05:26.080> my

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
o'clock notice sometimes I hold my

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.900 
o'clock notice sometimes I hold my
finger<00:05:26.710> on<00:05:26.740> here<00:05:27.010> makes<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.640> doesn't

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
finger on here makes it so it doesn't

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.450 
finger on here makes it so it doesn't
spin<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.300> easily<00:05:28.900> clicks<00:05:29.170> into<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:30.040> tension

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
spin and easily clicks into the tension

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.700 
spin and easily clicks into the tension
area<00:05:30.610> down<00:05:30.970> below<00:05:31.120> needle<00:05:31.810> goes<00:05:31.960> in<00:05:32.140> last<00:05:32.380> it's

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
area down below needle goes in last it's

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.680 
area down below needle goes in last it's
just<00:05:32.890> easier<00:05:33.430> because<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:34.120> can<00:05:34.270> set<00:05:34.540> the

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
just easier because you can set the

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.660 
just easier because you can set the
needle<00:05:34.960> down<00:05:35.170> into<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.560> foot<00:05:35.890> and<00:05:36.040> then<00:05:36.340> bring

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
needle down into the foot and then bring

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.710 
needle down into the foot and then bring
it<00:05:36.790> right<00:05:36.820> up<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.660> where<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.440> needs<00:05:38.920> to<00:05:39.040> go<00:05:39.130> into

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
it right up to where it needs to go into

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.930 
it right up to where it needs to go into
or<00:05:40.720> tightening<00:05:41.710> oh<00:05:41.980> yeah<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.460> tightened<00:05:42.880> it

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
or tightening oh yeah I tightened it

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.300 
or tightening oh yeah I tightened it
when<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.120> hook<00:05:43.660> it<00:05:43.810> out<00:05:43.930> don't<00:05:44.380> do<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.770> much

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
when I hook it out don't do that much

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.860 
when I hook it out don't do that much
harder<00:05:45.670> to<00:05:45.700> put<00:05:45.910> it<00:05:46.000> in<00:05:46.120> once<00:05:46.360> it's<00:05:46.540> tightened

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
harder to put it in once it's tightened

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.870 
harder to put it in once it's tightened
loosen<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.860> tight-knit<00:05:48.130> make<00:05:48.400> sure<00:05:48.490> goes<00:05:48.640> all

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
loosen it tight-knit make sure goes all

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.460 
loosen it tight-knit make sure goes all
the<00:05:48.910> way<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.270> highest<00:05:49.420> position<00:05:49.720> when<00:05:50.440> I

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
the way to the highest position when I

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.870 
the way to the highest position when I
rethread<00:05:50.980> I'm<00:05:51.100> going<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.280> use<00:05:51.400> that<00:05:51.520> needle

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
rethread I'm going to use that needle

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.120 
rethread I'm going to use that needle
threader<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.240> make<00:05:52.510> sure<00:05:52.810> that<00:05:53.620> because<00:05:53.830> the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
threader and make sure that because the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.890 
threader and make sure that because the
needle<00:05:54.370> threader<00:05:54.610> will<00:05:54.700> work<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.570> I've<00:05:55.690> got

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
needle threader will work that I've got

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.050 
needle threader will work that I've got
that<00:05:56.080> needle<00:05:56.410> high<00:05:56.740> enough<00:05:57.040> into<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.610> machine

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
that needle high enough into the machine

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.090 
that needle high enough into the machine
so<00:05:58.570> rethread<00:05:59.110> bring<00:05:59.440> your<00:05:59.590> bobbin<00:05:59.860> thread<00:06:00.040> up
