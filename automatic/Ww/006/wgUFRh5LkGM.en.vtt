00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
myself looking around the internet even

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
myself looking around the internet even
putting<00:00:29.730> together<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.090> repository<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
putting together a repository of

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.569 
putting together a repository of
wallpapers<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.439> love<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.309> perhaps<00:00:32.399> use

wallpapers I love that I can perhaps use
in<00:00:32.850> future<00:00:33.020> because<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.230> never<00:00:34.469> happy

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

with<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.820> thought<00:00:36.149> why<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.600> hand

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
with it so I thought why not just hand

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
with it so I thought why not just hand
over<00:00:37.110> control<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:37.860> wallpaper<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.610> someone

this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> where<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.870> quite<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
this is where I quite like it and it's

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.030 
this is where I quite like it and it's
got<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> blurred<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.080> feature<00:02:38.290> if<00:02:38.830> we<00:02:38.920> go

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
got a blurred in the feature if we go

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.620 
got a blurred in the feature if we go
through<00:02:39.190> both<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.490> those<00:02:39.790> blur<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.420> course

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
through both of those blur of course

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.940 
through both of those blur of course
it's<00:02:40.780> pretty<00:02:40.870> self-explanatory<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.830> gonna

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it's pretty self-explanatory it's gonna

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.040 
it's pretty self-explanatory it's gonna
blur<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.460> background<00:02:42.610> image<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.540> they<00:02:43.870> may

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
blur the background image and they may

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.600 
blur the background image and they may
think<00:02:44.110> I'm<00:02:44.440> gonna<00:02:44.620> blow<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> background<00:02:45.520> image

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
think I'm gonna blow a background image

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.520 
think I'm gonna blow a background image
of<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.450> really<00:02:46.630> nice<00:02:46.750> piece<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:46.990> art<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.410> like

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
of a really nice piece of art I like

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.230 
of a really nice piece of art I like
transients<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.250> my<00:02:48.340> background<00:02:48.760> there's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
transients but on my background there's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.070 
transients but on my background there's
a<00:02:49.330> good<00:02:49.480> reason<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
a good reason for that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.590 
a good reason for that
we're<00:02:51.040> out<00:02:51.190> full<00:02:51.490> because<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.420> see

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
we're out full because I like to see

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.880 
we're out full because I like to see
nice<00:02:52.810> blurry<00:02:53.140> backgrounds<00:02:53.590> because<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.770> think

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
nice blurry backgrounds because I think

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.110 
nice blurry backgrounds because I think
blowing<00:02:54.220> backgrounds<00:02:54.580> are<00:02:54.670> actually<00:02:54.910> quite

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
blowing backgrounds are actually quite

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
blowing backgrounds are actually quite
nice<00:02:55.300> because<00:02:55.960> they<00:02:56.080> make<00:02:56.230> everything<00:02:56.470> look

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
nice because they make everything look

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.250 
nice because they make everything look
like<00:02:56.740> everything's<00:02:57.190> floating<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.730> top<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.390> if

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
like everything's floating on top and if

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680 
like everything's floating on top and if
I<00:02:59.470> put<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.740> blur<00:02:59.980> for<00:03:00.310> forever<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.330> go<00:03:01.450> back

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
I put a blur for forever and I go back

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.260 
I put a blur for forever and I go back
to<00:03:01.840> my<00:03:01.960> desktop<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.100> home<00:03:03.250> screen<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.940> blurs

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
to my desktop on my home screen it blurs

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.600 
to my desktop on my home screen it blurs
it<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> don't<00:03:05.770> have<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.100> open<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.460> app

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
it out but I don't have to open the app

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.730 
it out but I don't have to open the app
to<00:03:06.910> actually<00:03:07.240> see<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> piece<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.900> artwork<00:03:08.110> if

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
to actually see the piece of artwork if

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.290

I've<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> free<00:03:09.370> piece<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.790> space<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.270> my

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
I've got a free piece of space on my

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300 
I've got a free piece of space on my
screen<00:03:10.660> where<00:03:10.900> there's<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.170> widget<00:03:11.500> or<00:03:11.830> an<00:03:12.220> icon

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
screen where there's a widget or an icon

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.940 
screen where there's a widget or an icon
I<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:13.270> double<00:03:13.630> tap<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.530> makes<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.920> image

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I can double tap and it makes the image

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.490 
I can double tap and it makes the image
crystal<00:03:15.580> clear<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.570> can<00:03:16.660> say<00:03:16.930> hey<00:03:17.050> there<00:03:17.350> is

we're going to advanced there's another

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.680 
we're going to advanced there's another
option<00:03:33.130> which<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.459> dim<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.510> very

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
option which is dim this is very

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630 
option which is dim this is very
self-explanatory<00:03:34.990> as<00:03:35.530> well<00:03:35.709> it's<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.370> slider

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
self-explanatory as well it's a slider

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.130 
self-explanatory as well it's a slider
from<00:03:36.850> left<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.209> right<00:03:37.510> which<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.870> going<00:03:38.050> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
from left to right which is going to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.480 
from left to right which is going to
make<00:03:38.320> them<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.740> background<00:03:39.310> wallpaper

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
make them but background wallpaper

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.660 
make them but background wallpaper
darker<00:03:40.390> or<00:03:40.780> lighter<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.890> if<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.100> perhaps<00:03:42.280> have
