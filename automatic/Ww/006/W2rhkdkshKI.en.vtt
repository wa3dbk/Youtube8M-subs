 earn on apps through 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 see the advertisement service itself collects in 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.880
 imagine several advertising sites such 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.900
 like chartboost popap unity ads 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 admob and others and a very big plus 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 this service is what it provides 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 just one library which itself 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.460
 works with all other sites then 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110

 moment section shops 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 and create new app glues about either 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.890
 create applications if the Russian version 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.799
 or not vandal idea something indifikator 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.990
 I hope you know what this is and orientation

 as your application will be visible on 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 screens vertically or bleached 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 ie portrait or not portrait 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:51.399
 then click create and you will appear 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.670
 in me Jobs your application further click 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.789
 and play the instruction is very simple on 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 you can actually yourself but for from 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.130
 loyalty will go along with you choose 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.640
 unity further download from children on 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.739
 currently version 112 8 after that 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.429
 how to download unpack and go 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.429
 unity 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:26.459
 next we need to import the import roll here 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:30.850
 he attacked open and push import 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.760
 after some time, the rations will be unpacked 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.340
 and you can proceed 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.709
 further integration further if you have 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.769
 already have android manifest you need 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.340
 who has what lines if you donâ€™t 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.320
 absolutely fumble that it is in appodeal 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.750
 already there is a need to go to the folder 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 android plugins and there is android 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.150
 manifest 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.200
 sample if you do not have in the folder plug-ins 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.200
 android 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 a file named android manifest then you 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 can safely take rename 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.570
 given in android manifest 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.799
 and everything if you open it there 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:18.000
 will be the same content that im 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:18.000
 you need to keep sites need 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 integrate from children 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.209
 for this you need to create one 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.020
 The script in principle is an example here. 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.910
 yet again 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.390
 Dima's appodeal you can collect already with 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.100
 This scene check that everything works 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.560
 here in real application most likely 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:46.970
 you will need to create an extra 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:49.860
 script let's call it for example from verta 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.420
 service I highly recommend everything 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.340
 to abstract from some 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.940
 whether you want a specific site 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.070
 then change so we will work 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.630
 Scroll through the script advertising 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.690
 the next thing to do is in the method 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.840
 start initialize the library for 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.230
 this need to connect the namespace 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.140
 appodeal here it will be added automatically 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.239
 cost and in the case of the elite api and 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.810
 cause you do not want to approach it should be 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.310
 pass the key that is on the site 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:29.340
 if you clicked a few minutes ago i 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:34.050
 I click on the button in the great 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.150
 times - abs here I clicked from playing in 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.479
 principle if you will go by 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.840
 instructions of the applications and will 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.280
 true but you can get it from here 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.970
 his applications and 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.930
 and drive it in here for example such 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.890
 and everything after that you can show already 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.380
 advertising there are two main methods a 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.510
 in the case is loaded 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.240
 checks if advertising is for a given 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.560
 type of all types of advertising that can be 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.560
 look about the department 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.000
 class in the matter that is, these constants 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.960
 This is the ad that can be displayed 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.360
 in this case loaded or not you can 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.979
 specific check check inter 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:26.940
 stop inter station this fullscreen 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:31.440
 banner video clear video and banner 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.180
 top center or bottom for example 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.950
 if we want to display now 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.810
 video ads then i need to here 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.630
 case transfer video 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.030
 that is, this method returns true or false. 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.419
 loaded or not further if i want 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:50.220
 show then call on the show department 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:54.780
 Here are the main two methods that are needed 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.780
 even if you want 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.860
 caught catching events 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:04.000
 example he clicked and users on 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:08.470
 the banner and in the case provided 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.169
 Kalmyks again can be in the instructions 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.070
 read more 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:17.440
 I only touch briefly again for 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.020
 class ab adele call the set and choose 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.610
 for which ad we want to install 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.080
 cola stories for example I want to install 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.120
 for video advertising call back 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.040
 for this I need to point here 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.820
 pass the class that implements here 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.930
 this interface 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.010
 i will do so i have current class 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.010
 implements this interface 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.870
 and then I can just write the address 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.000
 so we do it right after initialization 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.340
 and all now when video ads 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.760
 loaded up but this method when 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.200
 they 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.360
 error loading this and so on 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.130
 probably the most important method this video 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.870
 finish it when we have advertising is over 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.030
 and we want to reward for example 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:13.710
 user at the end of the video then 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:16.230
 we are doing this call back doing something well 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:22.800
 that's probably all you wanted 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:26.040
 tell about this service if 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.840
 questions ask them in the comments with you 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.640
 was Alexander Sosnovsky 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.640
 good money to you bye
