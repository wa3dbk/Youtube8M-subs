00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
Xbox one does not like to cooperate very

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
Xbox one does not like to cooperate very
well<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:20.449> monitors

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
well with monitors

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.950 
well with monitors
I<00:00:21.859> find<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.070> funky<00:00:23.519> anyway<00:00:24.150> here's<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I find it a bit funky anyway here's a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
I find it a bit funky anyway here's a
solution<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> found<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:28.130> used<00:00:29.130> an<00:00:29.490> old

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
solution that I found I used an old

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600 
solution that I found I used an old
amplifier<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> had<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> Sony<00:00:31.710> 5.1<00:00:32.460> surround

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
amplifier that I had a Sony 5.1 surround

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.380 
amplifier that I had a Sony 5.1 surround
sound<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:34.070> you'll<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.280> especially<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.270> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
sound now you'll get especially on this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.619 
sound now you'll get especially on this
Wolfenstein<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.160> problems<00:00:38.629> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
Wolfenstein you will get problems that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.229 
Wolfenstein you will get problems that
it'll<00:00:40.170> only<00:00:40.260> work<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.680> 5.1<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.520> 7.1<00:00:42.120> surround

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it'll only work on 5.1 or 7.1 surround

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
it'll only work on 5.1 or 7.1 surround
sound<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:43.890> need<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.160> amplifier<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
sound so you don't need an amplifier you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.020 
sound so you don't need an amplifier you
need<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> set<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> speakers<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.579> log<00:00:47.789> into

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
need a set of speakers that log into

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.110 
need a set of speakers that log into
your<00:00:48.120> monitor<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.350> fine<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
your monitor which would be fine so I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.430 
your monitor which would be fine so I
have<00:00:53.030> nothing<00:00:54.030> extra<00:00:54.329> set<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
have nothing extra set up here I have

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
have nothing extra set up here I have
this<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.219> only<00:00:56.430> extra<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
this but this is only extra if you have

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
this but this is only extra if you have
a<00:00:57.600> surround<00:00:58.320> sound<00:00:58.559> system<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> optical

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a surround sound system it's the optical

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
a surround sound system it's the optical
cable<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.210> don't<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
cable you don't actually need it if you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.060 
cable you don't actually need it if you
get<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> set<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> normal<00:01:02.879> speakers<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.809> PC<00:01:04.350> but

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
get a set of normal speakers for PC but

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
get a set of normal speakers for PC but
what<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.610> need<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.990> cable<00:01:07.560> here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what you will need is this cable here

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.410 
what you will need is this cable here
which<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.630> 3.5<00:01:09.630> millimeter<00:01:10.110> jack<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
which is 3.5 millimeter jack if it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
which is 3.5 millimeter jack if it
focuses<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.330> hear<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:18.860> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
focuses there as you can hear it that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
focuses there as you can hear it that
goes<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.939> that'll<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.780> into

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
goes in there and that'll just go into

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.710 
goes in there and that'll just go into
the<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.290> speakers<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.670> it'll<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.509> into

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the back here speakers or it'll go into

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.850 
the back here speakers or it'll go into
your<00:01:24.869> amplifier<00:01:25.320> system<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.330> yeah<00:01:27.530> wires<00:01:28.530> are

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
your amplifier system and yeah wires are

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
your amplifier system and yeah wires are
everywhere<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.299> anyway<00:01:31.070> that's<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> get

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
everywhere but anyway that's how you get

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
everywhere but anyway that's how you get
it<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> work<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.630> set<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> with

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it to work and I just set it up with

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450 
it to work and I just set it up with
warm<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:36.509> speakers<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
warm to three speakers over there and it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.620 
warm to three speakers over there and it
works<00:01:38.700> fine<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.600> them

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.090 

so<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.869> monitor<00:01:46.290> actually<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:46.920> speakers

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
so this monitor actually has speakers

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.030 
so this monitor actually has speakers
both<00:01:51.440> there<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:55.440> Mon<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.740> actually

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
both there you go the Mon are actually

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490 
both there you go the Mon are actually
has<00:01:56.220> speakers<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.690> they<00:01:57.720> don't<00:01:57.960> work<00:01:58.170> because

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
has speakers but they don't work because

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.130 
has speakers but they don't work because
they're<00:01:58.830> not<00:01:58.920> 5.1<00:01:59.700> or<00:01:59.970> 7.1<00:02:00.690> surround<00:02:00.869> sound

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
they're not 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.410 
they're not 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound
and<00:02:01.530> uncompressed<00:02:03.170> we<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.100> here

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:24.910 

turn<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.660> joypads<00:02:22.850> stereo<00:02:23.850> uncompressed

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
turn on my joypads stereo uncompressed

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.250 
turn on my joypads stereo uncompressed
over<00:02:25.920> here<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> corner

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
over here in the corner

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.229 
over here in the corner
good<00:02:28.260> screen<00:02:28.709> stereo<00:02:28.980> uncompressed<00:02:29.190> does<00:02:30.060> not

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
good screen stereo uncompressed does not

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.600 
good screen stereo uncompressed does not
work<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.840> speakers<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.100> speakers<00:02:32.459> on

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
work with this speakers the speakers on

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.870 
work with this speakers the speakers on
this<00:02:32.730> monitor<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.600> unfortunately<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.760> had<00:02:35.760> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
this monitor so unfortunately I had to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.449 
this monitor so unfortunately I had to
guess<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.569> plug<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.900> my<00:02:37.080> amp<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.470> my

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
guess at the plug in my amp and my

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.000 
guess at the plug in my amp and my
surround<00:02:38.819> sound<00:02:39.120> together<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.810> work<00:02:40.019> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
surround sound together to work bit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.170 
surround sound together to work bit
inconvenient<00:02:41.840> both<00:02:43.130> works<00:02:44.130> pretty<00:02:44.670> well<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
inconvenient both works pretty well and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
inconvenient both works pretty well and
if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.050> any<00:02:46.230> questions<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> set<00:02:47.190> up

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
if you have any questions on the set up

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340
