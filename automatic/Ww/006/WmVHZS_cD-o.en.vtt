to<00:02:03.220> play<00:02:03.400> faster<00:02:03.880> they<00:02:04.000> think<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.330> too<00:02:04.420> much

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
to play faster they think of too much

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.090 
to play faster they think of too much
out<00:02:04.750> there<00:02:04.780> well<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.440> think<00:02:05.530> sometimes<00:02:05.860> that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
out there well I think sometimes that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.639 
out there well I think sometimes that
happens<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:07.090> general<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.900> know<00:02:08.020> our<00:02:08.259> our<00:02:08.319> game

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
happens in general you know our our game

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.469 
happens in general you know our our game
plan<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:08.920> pretty<00:02:09.340> simple<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.239> we

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
plan was pretty simple going in so we

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.370 
plan was pretty simple going in so we
thought<00:02:10.509> would<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.810> able<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.050> play<00:02:11.140> pretty

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
thought would be able to play pretty

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.410 
thought would be able to play pretty
fast<00:02:11.650> because<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.940> wanted<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.239> limit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
fast because of that we wanted to limit

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
fast because of that we wanted to limit
they<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.720> some<00:02:13.900> great<00:02:13.989> receivers<00:02:14.560> from<00:02:14.680> big

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
they have some great receivers from big

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
they have some great receivers from big
time<00:02:15.220> NFL<00:02:15.580> guys<00:02:15.790> outside<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.900> wanted<00:02:17.170> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
time NFL guys outside there we wanted to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.840 
time NFL guys outside there we wanted to
limit<00:02:17.440> their<00:02:17.770> ability<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.160> catch<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:18.790> of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
limit their ability to catch a lot of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.910 
limit their ability to catch a lot of
easy<00:02:19.060> passes<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.319> did<00:02:20.500> play<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> lot

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
easy passes and so we did play a lot

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.380 
easy passes and so we did play a lot
more<00:02:21.190> cover<00:02:21.519> 2<00:02:21.760> than<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.000> normally<00:02:22.090> play

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
more cover 2 than we normally play

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
more cover 2 than we normally play
easily<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:22.959> play<00:02:23.110> hardly<00:02:23.410> at<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.590> but

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
easily we don't play hardly at all but

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.130 
easily we don't play hardly at all but
in<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.580> game<00:02:24.700> because<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.810> what<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.019> had

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
in this game because of what they had

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.979 
in this game because of what they had
done<00:02:26.320> not<00:02:27.070> running<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> ball<00:02:27.580> coming<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.030> and
