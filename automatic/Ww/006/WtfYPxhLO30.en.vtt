00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.910 
blend shapes in Maya I think it's pretty
neat<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.460> I'll<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.570> demonstrate<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.889> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
neat and I'll just demonstrate how to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.829 
neat and I'll just demonstrate how to
use<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.429> or<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:14.759> least<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> know<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
use that or at least how I know how to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.769 
use that or at least how I know how to
use<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.910> you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.029> I'll<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.359> creative

with that and see if you can find out

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
with that and see if you can find out
very<00:00:20.970> cool<00:00:21.240> ways<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> apply<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.500> right

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
very cool ways to apply that all right

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.609 
very cool ways to apply that all right
let's<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> start<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.590> by

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
let's go so I'm going to start off by

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
let's go so I'm going to start off by
creating<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.730> couple<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.150> polygon<00:00:27.660> objects<00:00:28.050> so

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
creating a couple of polygon objects so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
creating a couple of polygon objects so
I'm<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> select<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> polygon

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I'm just going to select a polygon

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.729 
I'm just going to select a polygon
sphere<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.460> drag<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.910> grid<00:00:33.469> just<00:00:34.469> go

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
sphere I drag that out in a grid just go

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.810 
sphere I drag that out in a grid just go
to<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:35.130> front<00:00:35.520> view<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.320> hit<00:00:37.320> W<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.280> pull<00:00:38.640> that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
to my front view and hit W and pull that

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.720 
to my front view and hit W and pull that
up<00:00:38.879> until<00:00:39.290> I'm<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.370> grid<00:00:41.579> line<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
up until I'm on my grid line like so and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.889 
up until I'm on my grid line like so and
I'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> duplicate<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.600> couple<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I'm going to duplicate that a couple of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.650 
I'm going to duplicate that a couple of
times<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.520> hit<00:00:47.610> five<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.210> shaded<00:00:48.510> mode

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
times so just hit five for shaded mode

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.160 
times so just hit five for shaded mode
okay<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> hit<00:00:51.180> control<00:00:51.600> D<00:00:54.170> pull

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
okay so I'm going to hit control D pull

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
okay so I'm going to hit control D pull
that<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.469> once<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> hit

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that over once and I'm going to hit

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.889 
that over once and I'm going to hit
shift<00:00:57.300> D<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.649> repeat<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> hit<00:01:00.420> shift<00:01:00.629> D

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
shift D to repeat that and hit shift D

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
shift D to repeat that and hit shift D
again<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.340> okay<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.830> four

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
again like so okay so now I got four

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.210 
again like so okay so now I got four
basic<00:01:05.970> objects<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
basic objects here now what I'm going to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
basic objects here now what I'm going to
do<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> select<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:09.990> at

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
do is I'm going to select that one at

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.859 
do is I'm going to select that one at
that<00:01:10.740> end<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.540> actually<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> do

with<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> sphere<00:01:16.430> I'm<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> right-click

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
with the sphere I'm going to right-click

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
with the sphere I'm going to right-click
go<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.960> vertex<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.360> I'm<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:22.259> drag

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
go to vertex and I'm going to just drag

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.480 
go to vertex and I'm going to just drag
select<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:24.420> portion<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> I'm

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
select a top portion of that and I'm

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.429 
select a top portion of that and I'm
going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> hit<00:01:26.729> R<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
going to hit R and I'm just going to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to hit R and I'm just going to
pull<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:30.420> look<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.659> something<00:01:30.960> like

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pull that in to look at something like

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.819 
pull that in to look at something like
that<00:01:31.520> okay<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:32.840> I'm<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> select<00:01:34.590> this

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that okay now I'm going to select this

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.760 
that okay now I'm going to select this
one<00:01:34.890> again<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:36.360> click<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.530> text

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
one again right click go to for text

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.730 
one again right click go to for text
mode<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> drag<00:01:39.540> select<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
mode and I'm going to drag select the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.920 
mode and I'm going to drag select the
middle<00:01:41.159> section<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.909> again<00:01:42.829> by<00:01:43.829> hitting<00:01:44.070> our

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
middle section and again by hitting our

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
middle section and again by hitting our
scale<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.310> obviously<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.090> get<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
scale that in so obviously you get a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.760 
scale that in so obviously you get a
little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:49.490> different<00:01:50.490> object<00:01:51.180> okay

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
little bit different object okay

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.819 
little bit different object okay
then<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> select<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
then I'm going to select that one and

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.300 
then I'm going to select that one and
I'm<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:58.040> let<00:01:59.040> me<00:01:59.159> see<00:02:01.009> okay<00:02:02.009> right

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I'm just going to let me see okay right

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.020 
I'm just going to let me see okay right
click<00:02:02.520> again<00:02:03.200> vertex

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
click again vertex

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.960 
click again vertex
and<00:02:05.120> I'll<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:05.780> select<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.980> bottom<00:02:07.640> part

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and I'll just select the bottom part

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.910 
and I'll just select the bottom part
okay<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.550> scaled<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.789> again<00:02:11.380> now<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:12.710> not

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
okay and scaled it in again now it's not

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.430 
okay and scaled it in again now it's not

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.860 
the idea of this tutorial to create
fancy<00:02:16.280> objects<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.090> show<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
fancy objects is to show you the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.350 
fancy objects is to show you the
function<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.560> okay<00:02:19.090> we're<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.300> go

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
function of it okay we're going to go

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.440 
function of it okay we're going to go
back<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.660> our<00:02:20.750> perspective<00:02:20.930> view<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.360> as<00:02:23.360> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
back to our perspective view and as you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.050 
back to our perspective view and as you
can<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.290> couple<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.920> odd<00:02:25.700> looking

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
can see I got a couple of odd looking

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.190 
can see I got a couple of odd looking
shapes<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.690> now<00:02:27.620> what<00:02:28.580> blend<00:02:29.090> shape<00:02:29.330> does<00:02:29.690> is

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
shapes here now what blend shape does is

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.510 
shapes here now what blend shape does is
I<00:02:30.800> got<00:02:31.160> three<00:02:31.940> different<00:02:32.330> shapes<00:02:32.630> here<00:02:33.080> and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
I got three different shapes here and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
I got three different shapes here and
through<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.730> blend<00:02:35.120> shape<00:02:35.390> process<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:36.709> to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
through the blend shape process so to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.210 
through the blend shape process so to
speak<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.880> apply<00:02:38.239> these<00:02:38.840> shapes<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:40.010> this

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
speak I can apply these shapes to this

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.780 
speak I can apply these shapes to this
master<00:02:41.150> shape<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> speak<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.040> I'm<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.730> to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
master shape so to speak so I'm going to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.210 
master shape so to speak so I'm going to
connect<00:02:44.330> these<00:02:44.600> three<00:02:45.110> with<00:02:45.410> my<00:02:45.620> master<00:02:46.010> shape

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
connect these three with my master shape

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.630 
connect these three with my master shape
and<00:02:46.480> how<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.500> right-click<00:02:48.890> go<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
and how I do that is I right-click go to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.840 
and how I do that is I right-click go to
object<00:02:49.880> mode<00:02:51.310> yeah<00:02:52.310> there<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.700> go

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
object mode yeah there we go

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.810 
object mode yeah there we go
I'm<00:02:53.450> going<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.690> drag<00:02:54.050> select<00:02:54.380> these<00:02:54.950> three<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
I'm going to drag select these three and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.710 
I'm going to drag select these three and
I'm<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.020> shift<00:02:57.650> click<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:59.180> master

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
I'm going to shift click on the master

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.580 
I'm going to shift click on the master
and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:01.400> I'm<00:03:01.459> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.330> my<00:03:02.630> animation

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
and then I'm going to go to my animation

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.510 
and then I'm going to go to my animation
in<00:03:04.430> my<00:03:05.120> drop-down<00:03:05.480> menu<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.250> go<00:03:07.459> to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
in my drop-down menu I'm going to go to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.270 
in my drop-down menu I'm going to go to
create<00:03:08.090> deformers<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.170> I'm<00:03:09.890> going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> click

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
create deformers and I'm going to click

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.140 
create deformers and I'm going to click
on<00:03:10.430> blend<00:03:11.030> shape<00:03:11.620> okay<00:03:12.650> now<00:03:13.459> nothing<00:03:13.970> happens

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
on blend shape okay now nothing happens

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.360 
on blend shape okay now nothing happens
as<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.870> can<00:03:15.019> see<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:16.840> let's<00:03:17.840> look<00:03:17.989> at<00:03:18.140> this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
as you can see but let's look at this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.130 
as you can see but let's look at this
okay<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.549> we<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:19.850> go<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.209> our<00:03:20.510> attribute

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
okay if we now go to our attribute

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.199 
okay if we now go to our attribute
editor<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.739> hit<00:03:22.160> control<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.940> doesn't

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
editor and hit control a that doesn't

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.070 
editor and hit control a that doesn't
show<00:03:23.330> up<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.690> we<00:03:24.470> go<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.709> our<00:03:24.860> blend<00:03:25.250> shape<00:03:25.489> tab

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
show up and we go to our blend shape tab

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.410 
show up and we go to our blend shape tab
you<00:03:27.080> see<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.380> got<00:03:27.799> sphere<00:03:28.250> two<00:03:28.549> three<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.120> four

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
you see I got sphere two three and four

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.620 
you see I got sphere two three and four
and<00:03:29.690> these<00:03:30.380> are<00:03:30.530> these<00:03:30.650> three<00:03:31.220> here<00:03:31.489> now<00:03:32.299> when

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
and these are these three here now when

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.240 
and these are these three here now when
I<00:03:32.660> start<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.730> drag<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:36.250> manipulator

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
I start to drag on on this manipulator

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.610 
I start to drag on on this manipulator
here<00:03:37.549> you'll<00:03:38.120> see<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.690> my<00:03:38.840> master<00:03:39.350> shape

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
here you'll see that my master shape

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.220 
here you'll see that my master shape
will<00:03:39.860> change<00:03:39.890> so<00:03:40.880> when<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.450> start<00:03:41.750> dragging<00:03:42.049> on

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
will change so when I start dragging on

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.650 
will change so when I start dragging on
that<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.620> as<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:43.130> can<00:03:43.250> see<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:44.209> starting<00:03:44.600> to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
that one as you can see it's starting to

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.490 
that one as you can see it's starting to
copy<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.590> model<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.579> number<00:03:46.820> two<00:03:47.000> sphere

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
copy the model of the number two sphere

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340 
copy the model of the number two sphere
when<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.530> select<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.810> copies<00:03:51.320> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
when I select that one it copies the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.160 
when I select that one it copies the
middle<00:03:51.890> one<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.630> when<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.660> drag<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.260> one

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
middle one and when I drag that one

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.360 
middle one and when I drag that one
let's<00:03:57.170> settle<00:03:57.440> one<00:03:57.650> now<00:04:00.010> if<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.370> drag<00:04:01.670> them<00:04:01.850> all

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
let's settle one now if I drag them all

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.800 
let's settle one now if I drag them all
you<00:04:04.370> can<00:04:04.430> see<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.760> get<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.120> total<00:04:05.360> different

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
you can see I get a total different

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.170 
you can see I get a total different
shape<00:04:06.049> now<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.769> cool<00:04:07.010> thing<00:04:07.100> about<00:04:07.280> this<00:04:07.700> is

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
shape now the cool thing about this is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.840 
shape now the cool thing about this is
you<00:04:08.570> can<00:04:08.720> use<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.200> in<00:04:09.470> animation<00:04:10.040> with<00:04:10.549> not

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
you can use this in animation with not

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.059 
you can use this in animation with not
actually<00:04:11.390> while<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:12.049> actually<00:04:12.200> changing<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
actually while not actually changing the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.380 
actually while not actually changing the
shape<00:04:13.790> because<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:14.930> pull<00:04:15.170> them<00:04:15.290> all<00:04:15.440> back<00:04:15.680> I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
shape because if I pull them all back I

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.840 
shape because if I pull them all back I
got<00:04:17.390> my<00:04:17.570> original<00:04:17.690> sphere<00:04:18.260> again

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
got my original sphere again

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.310 
got my original sphere again
okay<00:04:19.850> quick<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.870> easy<00:04:21.019> very<00:04:21.739> very<00:04:22.070> simple<00:04:22.580> and
