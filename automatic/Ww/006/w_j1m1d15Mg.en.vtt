00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.470
Broadway: Alright, swoop?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.210
Swoop: Yes.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.250
Broadway:: Finally move down to the post baby.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.250
Swoop: Oh, that's my favorite spot.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.250
Yes, I like the post, man.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.080
Broadway:: That's where the big guys dare
to nail.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.509
Swoop: Yes, I like it down there.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.430
Broadway: Yes, it's real rough and tough down
there.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
Swoop: OK.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.590
Broadway: But you also got to have what's
called the finesse game.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.260
Swoop: Oh, the finesse game like Tim Duncan.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Broadway: Yes, Tim Duncan.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.710
Swoop: Always makes a turn around...

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.990
Broadway: Turn around, that's what working
on, turn around jump shot.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.950
In order to get a good turn around jump shot,
Swoop, you first got to learn the footwork.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.950
Swoop: Footwork!

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.950
Broadway: Footwork.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.950
Swoop: We talked about that earlier, right?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.950
Broadway: Let me see some footwork.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.950
Swoop: Oh!

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.950
Broadway: Yes.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.600
Let us see some footwork here!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
What's that?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
Swoop: That's only my foot working.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.249
Broadway: So, we're going to let the expert
step in.

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:44.249
Swoop: OK.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.430
Broadway: BP to show us some footwork in the
post and breaking it down, step by step.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.430
Swoop: Step by step!

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.660
Broadway: The turn around jump shot.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.359
Swoop: OK, let's see what he's got.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.039
Broadway: Here we go.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.250
This is what we're going to do.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.250
Swoop: OK.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.499
Broadway: First you're going to establish
good post position.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:00:59.499
Swoop: OK.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.499
He's in the post.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.730
Broadway: You want to get a wide base and
then, you're going to show, first, a turn

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.699
around jump shot over the right shoulder.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.699
Swoop: OK.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:06.699
Broadway: I'm going to pass it to BP.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.699
He catches the ball.

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:09.280
He turns to the right shoulder.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.730
Good footwork, he's square to the basket.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.730
Get a good release point.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.730
Swoop: OK.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.730
Good balance!

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.730
Alright, now we're going to do the same thing
[NOISE].

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.600
We're going to do that same turn around, [NOISE]
but we're going over the left shoulder this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.600
time.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Swoop: Oh!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
He shoulders and asks for the ball.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
I pass it to him.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.690
They're inside, turn outside.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.030
Still got good footwork.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.230
He's able to shoot it.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.270
Gets a good shot off.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.270
Swoop: Right.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.100
Broadway: Now, we're going to do what's called
the inside pivot.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.100
Swoop: OK.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.520
Broadway: This catches the defense a little
bit off balance.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
Swoop: Right.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.930
Broadway: I pass the ball and side to him,
inside pivot.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.480
Notice, instead of turning to his outside,
he swung his foot inside, but he's still in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.280
the same position to be able to...

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Swoop: Still square.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Broadway: Yes.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
He's still square to the basket.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.830
[Noise] Now we're going to let BP get a couple
repetitions so you could see his game speed.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.830
Swoop: OK, cool.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.280
Broadway: Here's BP in the post turn around
jump shot, over the left shoulder.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
Swoop: That's nice.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.070
Broadway: Then he comes back over, over the
right shoulder, and over the left shoulder

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.070
again.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.070
Why not?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.070
Swoop: Yes!

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.070
Broadway: Hey, if it works, keep going to
it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.070
Here we go.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.290
BP's in the post, over the right shoulder.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.290
Swoop: Nice.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.290
Broadway: Remix on him.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.290
You see that?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410
Now he's coming back, over the left shoulder,
inside.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.410
Swoop: Nice.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.930
Broadway: He established good position.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.450
First, he's got to call for it.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.450
Swoop: OK.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.450
Broadway: I don't here him.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.450
BP: Right here baby!

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
Swoop: Alright.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.450
Broadway: OK.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.450
There he goes.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.450
He's got the ball.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.450
Damn!

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.450
That's a good jump shot.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.450
See, then you start getting that bounce when
you make a couple.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.450
Swoop: OK.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.450
Broadway: Then you're going to go inside pivot.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.450
See that?

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.450
He's got it.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.450
Damn, squared the defense up.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.450
He looks at him!

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
You saw that?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.450
Swoop: Nice.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.450
Broadway: Here we go.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.450
Inside pivot.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.450
Where you want it?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.450
Where you want it?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.450
Oh!

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.450
Look at that pass!

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.450
Swoop, you see that?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.450
Swoop: Look at the footwork though, man.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.450
Broadway: Yes, that's what it's all about.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.450
Swoop: The footwork's good.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.450
Broadway: It's all about the footwork.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.450
See that?

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.959
If you practice good technique and good footwork,
you can make sure that you have great post

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.590
presence and get a good shot off with a turn
around jump shot.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.920
[NOISE] You have balance.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.930
You want to make sure you get good post position.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Swoop: Yes.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.109
Broadway: You make that turn around jump shot.
