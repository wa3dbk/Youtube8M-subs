00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
another thing I had is to the bike was

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.670 
another thing I had is to the bike was

powder coating in black but some of the
powder<00:05:35.890> coaters<00:05:36.400> I've<00:05:36.550> talked<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.240> that

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
powder coaters I've talked to in that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.160

entire<00:05:37.960> anyway<00:05:39.120> least<00:05:40.120> one<00:05:40.390> said<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.780> he

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
entire anyway least one said that he

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.290 
entire anyway least one said that he
couldn't<00:05:41.470> guarantee<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.640> would<00:05:42.820> stick

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
couldn't guarantee that it would stick
