now I add just about a quart of milk to
this<00:01:54.710> frying<00:01:55.040> pan<00:01:55.430> which<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.290> usually<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> 10

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
this frying pan which is usually a 10

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.390 
this frying pan which is usually a 10
inch<00:01:57.830> frying<00:01:58.160> pans<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:58.970> like<00:01:59.210> these

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
inch frying pans what I like these

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:20.890 
inch frying pans what I like these
cast-iron<00:02:01.840> as<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.900> matter<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:03.350> fact

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.440 

now<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.799> this<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.280> done<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.760> medium<00:02:23.209> heat

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
now all of this is done on medium heat

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.390 
now all of this is done on medium heat
you<00:02:23.840> continue<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.849> stir<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.030> mixture<00:02:27.400> because

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you continue to stir the mixture because

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.240 
you continue to stir the mixture because
what<00:02:28.730> happens<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.689> that<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.439> starch<00:02:30.829> from<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
what happens is that the starch from the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.240 
what happens is that the starch from the
flower<00:02:31.780> will<00:02:32.780> actually<00:02:33.470> stick<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:34.069> bottom

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
flower will actually stick to the bottom

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.059 
flower will actually stick to the bottom
of<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.700> pan<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.450> will<00:02:35.870> burn<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.769> if<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.950> don't

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
of the pan and will burn so if you don't

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.720 
of the pan and will burn so if you don't
stir<00:02:37.930> continually<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:39.950> problem<00:02:40.310> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
stir continually you have a problem and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.309 
stir continually you have a problem and

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
remember to stay on medium heat no

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.190 
remember to stay on medium heat no
warmer<00:02:45.859> than<00:02:46.040> that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.720 

the<00:02:53.200> amount<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.590> flour<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:54.129> were<00:02:54.280> used<00:02:54.549> here

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the amount of flour that were used here

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.520 
the amount of flour that were used here
was<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:56.560> about<00:02:56.950> Africa

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
in our crazy I guess that's one reason i

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.640 
in our crazy I guess that's one reason i
call<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> pepper<00:03:12.020> gravy<00:03:12.410> i<00:03:13.930> also<00:03:14.930> use<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.320> lot<00:03:15.620> of

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to come to the top of the mixture this

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.800 
to come to the top of the mixture this
is<00:04:10.230> what's<00:04:10.470> happening<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:12.150> before<00:04:12.330> it

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
is what's happening just before it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
once it starts boiling the gravy will

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.790 
once it starts boiling the gravy will
thicken<00:04:21.870> because<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.169> flour<00:04:23.439> and<00:04:23.620> grease

thicken because of the flour and grease
mixture<00:04:24.669> or<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:25.000> roux<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.479> was<00:04:25.629> made

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
mixture or the roux that was made

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.170 
mixture or the roux that was made
earlier<00:04:26.319> and<00:04:27.270> when<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:29.229> comes<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:30.009> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
earlier and when it comes to the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.330 
earlier and when it comes to the
consistency<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:32.069> take<00:04:33.069> the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
consistency that you like take the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.140 
consistency that you like take the
mixture<00:04:33.909> off<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.449> heat

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.720 

the<00:04:38.750> thing<00:04:38.960> about<00:04:38.990> gravy<00:04:39.590> is<00:04:39.980> as<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.460> cools

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
the thing about gravy is as it cools

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.670 
the thing about gravy is as it cools
down<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.480> they<00:04:41.750> can't<00:04:42.170> get<00:04:42.530> picture<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.870> if<00:04:45.320> it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
down is they can't get picture so if it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.000 
down is they can't get picture so if it
says<00:04:45.920> consistency<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.560> then<00:04:48.560> take<00:04:48.800> it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
says consistency that you I then take it

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.129 
says consistency that you I then take it
off<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.370> heat<00:04:49.400> immediately

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.809 

it<00:04:56.139> will<00:04:56.349> continue<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.979> thicken<00:04:57.309> if<00:04:57.639> you're

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
it will continue to thicken if you're

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.060 
it will continue to thicken if you're
not<00:04:57.939> real<00:04:58.180> careful

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.190 

and<00:05:01.640> really<00:05:01.910> that's<00:05:02.120> all<00:05:02.390> there<00:05:02.570> is<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.720> make

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
and really that's all there is to make

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.190 
and really that's all there is to make
an<00:05:03.350> M<00:05:03.530> particular<00:05:03.800> dish
