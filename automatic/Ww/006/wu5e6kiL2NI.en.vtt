00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
see he's inside of a furnace and look we

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.400 
see he's inside of a furnace and look we
have<00:00:25.890> fish<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.689> possibly<00:00:27.900> mean

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
have fish now that can possibly mean

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.679 
have fish now that can possibly mean
that<00:00:28.439> fishing<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.310> confirmed<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.570> you're

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that fishing is confirmed that you're

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.240 
that fishing is confirmed that you're
able<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.800> why<00:00:32.099> they

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
able to get that I don't see why they

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
able to get that I don't see why they
would<00:00:32.279> give<00:00:32.610> us<00:00:32.820> fish<00:00:33.390> without<00:00:33.690> having<00:00:34.380> us

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
would give us fish without having us

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
would give us fish without having us
have<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> ability<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> fish<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> thought

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
have the ability to fish so I thought

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.319 
have the ability to fish so I thought
this<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.620> neat<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.820> already<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
this was very neat they do already have

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
this was very neat they do already have
what<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.930> already<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.309> block<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.730> cold

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
what we already have the block of cold

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080
