00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.980

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 no one could find me once i 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.860
 left alone against the left and to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.430
 win I decided to capture the base 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.659
 I stand on the capture and then he comes 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.290
 that there is no one at the base but the capture is on 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.860
 stood for a while 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.519
 and I say 0 about pro to you and the most 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 came and drowned so here I almost 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.750
 got an invader 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.540
 stood and fell asleep 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.790
 woke up only at night 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.040

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.800

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.290
 driving past somehow 1 barn and here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.290
 I hear someone void 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.930
 I thought at first that it seemed to me but 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.520
 no listening 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.520
 did not base hear howl 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.030
 what if someone calls for help 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.200
 think about it and then I started acting 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.970
 resolutely 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.970
 i will save you 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.730
 nobody needed my help on the sides 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.720
 just the owner of the barn forgot to turn off 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.959
 radio 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.120
 and at that moment Vitas sang therefore 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.239
 I take this opportunity to turn to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.550
 all barn owners, please don't 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.519
 forget to turn off your radios 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.099
 when you leave the room so good 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.730
