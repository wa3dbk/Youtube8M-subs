00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hey guys 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.669
 Welcome very much, come and get one more. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.039
 channel video and committed 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.730
 this is the first child of five 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.099
 It's going to be good this week. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.029
 as you many videos solado week and 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:27.140
 I think this is a picture in the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.529
 channel and I 'll call the right ludic 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 what is the name of my old passion ok 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.590
 good in the first video of tips on 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 dogs because the said but I chose to speak 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.160
 on the coast good judgment because I chose 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.150
 help because most of the top 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 rankings 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.000
 they are talented ie they are talented 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 taxi users together in one of the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.030
 first doubts that people have with 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 respect to thaisa are cited by the fact that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.880
 they do not have elements 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.910
 they have - together 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.520
 good the answer is no and this part is in 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.430
 I do not have a disadvantage is true 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.980
 the fact that the technicians do not not have a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 element shall be considered an assembly by 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.070
 many because we stop taking 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.110
 too cautious and why many with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.120
 this class 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.480
 why many a topic why not 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.800
 take a car to finish here and also 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.909
 Most of the drugs they are now 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.390
 much advantage to this class because 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.120
 I believe it is for the numerous 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 number of players in the terminal is 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.370
 almost left everything the same I already said one 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 little about class 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.920
 So let's get some bild tips for 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 what 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.560
 you can see in the example of coke 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.579
 benin mixed will be part of mine with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.159
 hakim 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.030
 I always start rohde by putting two 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.239
 points on resistance strength 3 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.039
 agility and 3 and conviction if you want 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.760
 concentration is concentrated 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.010
 because I always put agility in the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 simple fact that nunes round 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.030
 important until that age you did not find 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.970
 I've never really got into a battle for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.530
 lack of agility so that sometimes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.769
 if you do not think about prosecution 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.450
 the setting is good to put the two in force 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.790
 the existing strength of 11 because two 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.380
 attack and defense with the existing 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.190
 put for example has strength and a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.980
 resistance 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.290
 I will stay as attack and defense 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 then the disadvantage and vice versa is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:54.269
 Of course, and when I read it, it's just that. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.489
 because now I'll give an example here to 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.730
 was connection so can reach the level 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.420
 10 ok I'm missing here the example of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.609
 of education monkeys and well I do not know 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.590
 You do not get those four by 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.889
 because four points in the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.630
 hpv region in japan that will help you 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:17.850
 Only kaka that I get here is not how 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.450
 example of connection I put conviction and 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.450
 Disconnection from the most patient connection 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.829
 education is already a good thing for the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.530
 your collection 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.660
 I always put 4 agility because with 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:37.240
 the activity of unt defense attack 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:40.690
 making you already have good 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.920
 And even if a kiss catches you, you do not. 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.360
 You'll be wrong because you're three years old. 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.230
 age of the clan and four more of the twelve 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.190
 vocation 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.780
 I already made it very strong I stopped 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.650
 existence 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.120
 I always put 2 existence here 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.030
 because you conviction in the residence 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.250
 conviction is all about then ok 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.520
 these two already existing in education 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.000
 to match how much this two of 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.510
 here 11 strength form the attack 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.730
 so in this bild we'll take that 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.880
 12 attack since the goal is to place 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.730
 one more dot there in the south and then here 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.810
 to match a clan is already 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:32.710
 with 123 attack only just looking here 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.170
 in the media 3d attack 12 of existence and 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.360
 three already had six attributes 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.990
 my accounts here if you do not have the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:47.190
 why then have respect for conviction 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:50.190
 An example is just that, let's go now 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.190
 concentration 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.320
 I will continue to use my 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.680
 example 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.500
 jack mich monkeys and I continue with the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.570
 same clan is basically the same 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.990
 agility because it would help the 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:12.560
 Basic Jewish the concentration and strength 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.880
 She cares for concentration in the stages, okay? 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.520
 You do not even have to be on duty. 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.820
 a little below 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.300
 good this squat unit attack defense 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.900
 as well as the role of jimmy collection 2 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.210
 concentration of evocation plus three of 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.500
 with the club is already a 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.630
 concentration of type shares of 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.310
 constraint against water and how to 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.110
 this previously felt the cuts of 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.910
 energy that is an energy the mouth in the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.060
 same world, right? 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.340
 I do not know if the taxes adding everything 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:54.090
 that which is already something 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:58.460
 significant and good is not to do that 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.470
 thing to get one from here to place where 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.889
 existence to put in force because 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.260
 or get to balance everything right 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.180
 keep this action do not want to know team 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.190
 that so my bild so my 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.620
 tip to see where we can see the best 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.050
 that yesterday I was able to ride on 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.020
 A good one is maybe that I use it on 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.580
 next round because that was the 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.159
 first video tips 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.810
 he has overcome environment has helped those 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.380
 intending to act together 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.880
 was just an example of a build that 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.090
 We have many truth but this is 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.680
 basically I'll use 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.380
 so if you want other examples 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.479

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.139

 Now there's tomorrow, there's more to it.

 You and those elect 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:03.000
