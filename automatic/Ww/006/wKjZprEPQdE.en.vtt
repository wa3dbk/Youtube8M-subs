we're<00:02:01.530> supposed<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.670> came<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> lot

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
we're supposed to we came out with a lot

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.380 
we're supposed to we came out with a lot
of<00:02:03.270> energy

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
of energy

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.640 
of energy
out<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.540> momentum<00:02:04.930> from<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.320> start<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
out of momentum from the start of the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.960 
out of momentum from the start of the
game<00:02:05.770> when<00:02:05.950> we<00:02:06.010> started<00:02:06.400> off<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.700> safety

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
game when we started off with a safety

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.760 
game when we started off with a safety
so<00:02:07.270> anytime<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.870> happens<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.410> definitely

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
so anytime that happens it's definitely

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.469 
so anytime that happens it's definitely
a<00:02:08.800> lot<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.039> momentum<00:02:09.250> defense<00:02:09.910> wins<00:02:10.000> twenty

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
a lot of momentum defense wins twenty

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.270 
a lot of momentum defense wins twenty
