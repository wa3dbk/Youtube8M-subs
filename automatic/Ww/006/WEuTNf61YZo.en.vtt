less<00:00:19.980> patience<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.570> time<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.259> Gurr<00:00:22.800> with

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
less patience it's time to go Gurr with

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.689 
less patience it's time to go Gurr with
the<00:00:23.579> gruel<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> gruel<00:00:25.800> clans<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.550> are

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the gruel so the gruel clans which are

the gruel so the gruel clans which are
all<00:00:26.790> about<00:00:26.969> red<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.329> green<00:00:27.840> mana<00:00:28.110> are

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
all about red and green mana are

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830 
all about red and green mana are
probably<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.309> guild<00:00:29.579> least<00:00:30.059> like<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.300> guild<00:00:30.660> on

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
probably the guild least like a guild on

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
probably the guild least like a guild on
Ravnica<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> that's<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.399> nature<00:00:32.550> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
Ravnica and that's because the nature of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
Ravnica and that's because the nature of
red<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.030> green<00:00:33.090> mana<00:00:33.360> mean<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.140> they're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
red and green mana mean that they're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
red and green mana mean that they're
sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> opposed<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> whole<00:00:35.789> idea<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
sort of opposed to the whole idea of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.310 
sort of opposed to the whole idea of
civilization

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
civilization

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
civilization
now<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.129> might<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.700> seem<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:38.969> they

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now that might make them seem like they

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.790 
now that might make them seem like they
have<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> work<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> margins<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> Ravnica

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
have to work at the margins of Ravnica

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
have to work at the margins of Ravnica
but<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.850> grooc<00:00:42.030> clans<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.629> quite<00:00:42.900> powerful

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but the grooc clans are quite powerful

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
but the grooc clans are quite powerful
and<00:00:43.560> have<00:00:43.890> persisted<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.610> many<00:00:45.000> millennia

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and have persisted for many millennia

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.110 
and have persisted for many millennia
all<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> wait<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.489> an<00:00:47.820> area

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
all they have to do is wait for an area

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
all they have to do is wait for an area
to<00:00:48.300> weaken<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.630> little<00:00:48.720> bit<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> move<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to weaken a little bit and move in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
to weaken a little bit and move in
they'll<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.850> area's<00:00:51.270> resources<00:00:51.810> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
they'll use up that area's resources and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
they'll use up that area's resources and
now<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.950> grool<00:00:53.280> territory<00:00:53.730> once<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> runs

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
now it's grool territory once it runs

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
now it's grool territory once it runs
out<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.720> resources<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.220> more

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
out of resources it's time for more

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.830 
out of resources it's time for more
conquering<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.149> raiding<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.720> more

coming back and I kept submitting all
these<00:02:21.000> designs<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.660> were<00:02:21.720> always

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
these designs and they were always

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
these designs and they were always
called<00:02:22.230> barbering<00:02:22.830> most<00:02:23.070> bolder<00:02:23.640> her

he would always like sacrifice a land
and<00:02:26.700> throw<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.240> at<00:02:27.390> something<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:29.100> don't

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
and throw it at something and we don't

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.400 
and throw it at something and we don't
really<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.660> sacrificing<00:02:30.660> lands<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.260> not

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
really like sacrificing lands it's not

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.370 
really like sacrificing lands it's not
very<00:02:31.650> fun<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.670> came<00:02:32.880> up<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.380> newer

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
very fun so we came up with a newer

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.980 
very fun so we came up with a newer
version<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.360> discards<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> land<00:02:36.660> card

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
version that discards a land card

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.920 
version that discards a land card
instead<00:02:37.530> which<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.910> little<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.690> palatable

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
instead which is a little more palatable

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.720 
instead which is a little more palatable
it<00:02:40.350> doesn't<00:02:40.620> put<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.890> quite<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.310> far<00:02:41.520> behind

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it doesn't put you quite so far behind

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.510 
it doesn't put you quite so far behind
and<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.630> sort<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> evokes<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.950> traditional

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
and it sort of evokes the traditional

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.940 
and it sort of evokes the traditional
feeling<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> Cyclops<00:02:45.540> who<00:02:45.780> takes<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.230> giant

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
feeling of the Cyclops who takes a giant

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.710 
feeling of the Cyclops who takes a giant
mountain<00:02:47.130> or<00:02:47.460> something<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.970> throws<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.570> at<00:02:48.690> a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
mountain or something and throws it at a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.100 
mountain or something and throws it at a
ship<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> board<00:02:50.880> Meurig<00:02:51.150> MOS<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.660> definitely<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
ship so board Meurig MOS is definitely a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.990 
ship so board Meurig MOS is definitely a
guy<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.410> love<00:02:52.800> we<00:02:53.280> experimented<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.940> couple

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
guy I love we experimented with a couple

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.370 
guy I love we experimented with a couple
of<00:02:54.270> different<00:02:54.540> things<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.810> design<00:02:55.140> but

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
of different things in design but

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870 
of different things in design but
development<00:02:55.950> has<00:02:56.040> made<00:02:56.220> their<00:02:56.430> own<00:02:56.459> creature

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
development has made their own creature

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.310 
development has made their own creature
out<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.030> him<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.750> made<00:02:57.900> me<00:02:58.050> really<00:02:58.170> excited

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
out of him and it made me really excited

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.620 
out of him and it made me really excited
to<00:02:58.680> see<00:02:58.830> him<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.010> first<00:02:59.220> time<00:02:59.370> because

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
to see him the first time because

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.790 
to see him the first time because

discarding land to just deal damage to
people<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.280> free<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.670> super<00:03:03.150> awesome

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
people for free is super awesome

people for free is super awesome
reminds<00:03:04.410> me<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.620> seismic<00:03:05.280> assault<00:03:05.640> from<00:03:05.910> back

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
reminds me of seismic assault from back

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.190 
reminds me of seismic assault from back
in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.300> day<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> built<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.050> deck

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
in the day when I built a deck

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440 
in the day when I built a deck

so<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.730> could<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:12.000> hit<00:03:12.180> your<00:03:12.360> cursed

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
so that you could just hit your cursed

I almost qualified for Pro Tour with
that<00:03:16.920> deck<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.459> very<00:03:17.670> fun<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.080> all

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
that deck and it's very fun so of all

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.900 
that deck and it's very fun so of all
the<00:03:19.410> five<00:03:19.560> mechanics<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.100> gatecrash<00:03:20.520> the

the five mechanics in gatecrash the

the five mechanics in gatecrash the
groove<00:03:21.420> mechanic<00:03:21.780> was<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.200> last

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
groove mechanic was actually the last

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.040 
groove mechanic was actually the last
mechanic<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:23.100> finalized<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.840> trick

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
mechanic that we finalized on the trick

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.900 
mechanic that we finalized on the trick
about<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.410> was<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.010> gruel<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> very<00:03:26.550> simple

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
about it was the gruel a very simple

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.420 
about it was the gruel a very simple
folk<00:03:27.120> they<00:03:27.540> liked<00:03:27.750> attacking<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:28.890> smashing

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
folk they liked attacking and smashing

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.949 
folk they liked attacking and smashing
and<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.970> wanted<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.390> sort<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.600> capture<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and we wanted to sort of capture the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.750 
and we wanted to sort of capture the
essence<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> gruel<00:03:31.800> but<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.489> way<00:03:32.580> that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
essence of the gruel but in a way that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.520 
essence of the gruel but in a way that
kind<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.940> had<00:03:33.090> some<00:03:33.120> complexity<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.840> play<00:03:34.080> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
kind of had some complexity in play so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.229 
kind of had some complexity in play so
like<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> simple<00:03:35.130> idea<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.760> something<00:03:36.209> that

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
like a simple idea but something that

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.210 
like a simple idea but something that
has<00:03:36.360> some<00:03:36.600> depth<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> came<00:03:37.980> up<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
has some depth to it and it came up the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.310
