00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
only way to prevent from this is to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.440 
only way to prevent from this is to
digivolve<00:02:38.440> them<00:02:38.830> by<00:02:39.190> shaking<00:02:39.580> them<00:02:39.850> fighting

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
digivolve them by shaking them fighting

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.870 
digivolve them by shaking them fighting
with<00:02:40.600> them<00:02:40.810> or<00:02:41.160> giving<00:02:42.160> them<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> item<00:02:42.760> to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
with them or giving them the item to

with them or giving them the item to
live<00:02:43.000> love<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.080> that's<00:02:44.709> one<00:02:45.130> thing<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.820> don't

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
live love so that's one thing I don't

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.509 
live love so that's one thing I don't
like<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.410> my<00:02:53.590> goal<00:02:53.830> Vermont<00:02:54.190> used<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
like that's so my goal Vermont used to

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.449 
like that's so my goal Vermont used to
be<00:02:54.670> uh<00:02:54.989> what's<00:02:55.989> called<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.410> bike<00:02:56.560> mine<00:02:56.769> but<00:02:57.190> I

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
be uh what's called the bike mine but I

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.580 
be uh what's called the bike mine but I
left<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.570> about<00:02:58.830> 5<00:02:59.910> 5<00:03:00.910> or<00:03:00.970> 2<00:03:01.269> hours<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.780> he

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
left it for about 5 5 or 2 hours and he

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.650 
left it for about 5 5 or 2 hours and he
downgraded<00:03:03.100> itself<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> go<00:03:03.790> online<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.300> I

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
downgraded itself to a go online and I

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.240 
downgraded itself to a go online and I
used<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.050> an<00:03:05.170> omni<00:03:05.440> monitors<00:03:05.860> Greymon

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
used to have an omni monitors Greymon

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.900 
used to have an omni monitors Greymon
and<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.519> turned<00:03:06.760> into<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.060> green<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:08.910> Seamus

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and it turned into a green one Seamus

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.860 
and it turned into a green one Seamus
regular<00:03:10.570> month<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.160> well<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.870> I'm

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
regular month so well it's like I'm

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.940 
regular month so well it's like I'm
guessing<00:03:14.170> that's<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> does<00:03:14.680> because

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
guessing that's what it does because

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.270 
guessing that's what it does because
it's<00:03:15.130> it's<00:03:15.640> Digimon<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.720> Pokemon<00:03:17.280> so

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's it's Digimon it's not in Pokemon so

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.250 
it's it's Digimon it's not in Pokemon so
in<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.549> anime<00:03:18.850> series<00:03:19.000> Day<00:03:19.420> Afternoon<00:03:20.049> it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
in the anime series Day Afternoon it

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.960 
in the anime series Day Afternoon it
evolved<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.769> back<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.100> their<00:03:21.220> own<00:03:21.310> farm<00:03:21.640> so

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
evolved to go back to their own farm so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.220 
evolved to go back to their own farm so
I<00:03:22.209> pretty<00:03:22.810> much<00:03:22.900> respect<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.450> yes<00:03:25.450> so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
I pretty much respect that and yes so

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.440 
I pretty much respect that and yes so

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
after that you have you have the map the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.810 
after that you have you have the map the
map<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.810> where<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.140> see<00:03:32.709> are<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.340> observed

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
the Wii to the fourth so that's pretty

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.920 
the Wii to the fourth so that's pretty
much<00:03:51.850> what<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.239> does<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.570> once<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.810> complete

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
much what it does and once you complete

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.650 
much what it does and once you complete
it<00:03:55.120> happens

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
it happens

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.090 
it happens
so<00:03:55.959> that's<00:03:56.350> pretty<00:03:56.500> much<00:03:56.680> yeah<00:03:56.799> ever<00:03:56.980> pretty

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
so that's pretty much yeah ever pretty

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.610 
so that's pretty much yeah ever pretty
much<00:03:57.280> new<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:58.269> that's<00:03:58.720> that<00:04:00.510> after<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:02.380> we

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
much new so that's that after that we

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.199 
much new so that's that after that we
have<00:04:02.739> items<00:04:03.160> items<00:04:03.549> where<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:03.910> view<00:04:04.180> all

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
have items items where you view all

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.110 
have items items where you view all
invite<00:04:04.630> all<00:04:04.870> your<00:04:05.049> items<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:06.459> power<00:04:06.910> up

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
invite all your items and to power up

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.020 
invite all your items and to power up
your<00:04:07.150> DZ<00:04:07.480> wines<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.380> here<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.620> have<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:09.030> double

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
your DZ wines so here I have a double

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.849 
your DZ wines so here I have a double
that<00:04:10.180> evolves<00:04:10.600> which<00:04:10.870> lets<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.440> digivolve

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
that evolves which lets you digivolve

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.120 
that evolves which lets you digivolve
twice<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.930> if<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.200> have<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.380> great<00:04:14.709> mind<00:04:14.890> it'll

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
twice so if you have a great mind it'll

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.699 
twice so if you have a great mind it'll
evolve<00:04:15.400> Greymon<00:04:15.940> it'll<00:04:16.450> go<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.630> mental<00:04:17.410> mental

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
evolve Greymon it'll go to mental mental

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.349 
evolve Greymon it'll go to mental mental
game<00:04:17.950> on<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.280> I'll<00:04:18.340> go<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.729> bar<00:04:18.970> green<00:04:19.150> one

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
game on and I'll go to the bar green one

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.589 
game on and I'll go to the bar green one
so<00:04:19.959> that's<00:04:20.109> what<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.560> pretty<00:04:20.799> much<00:04:20.890> does<00:04:21.599> next

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
so that's what you pretty much does next

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.680 
so that's what you pretty much does next
is<00:04:22.900> power<00:04:23.349> shifter

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.710 

yeah<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:27.870> power<00:04:28.080> shifter<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.389> if<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.569> guys

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
yeah it's power shifter so if you guys

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.200 
yeah it's power shifter so if you guys
know<00:04:30.990> if<00:04:31.560> when<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.099> battle<00:04:32.340> with<00:04:32.580> any<00:04:32.759> device

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
know if when you battle with any device

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.510 
know if when you battle with any device

it'll a little God you okay down there

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.629 
it'll a little God you okay down there
it'll<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.300> moving<00:04:36.569> so<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:38.039> higher<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.250> go<00:04:38.610> up

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
it'll be moving so the higher you go up

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.490 
it'll be moving so the higher you go up
the<00:04:38.789> better<00:04:39.419> your<00:04:39.690> attack<00:04:39.930> will<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
the better your attack will be and the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.140 
the better your attack will be and the
lower<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.830> go<00:04:41.009> the<00:04:41.039> lower<00:04:41.639> your<00:04:41.819> attack<00:04:42.030> will

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
lower you go the lower your attack will

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.860 
lower you go the lower your attack will
be<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:43.199> it<00:04:43.860> pretty<00:04:44.250> much<00:04:44.340> slows<00:04:45.300> down<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.690> God

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
be so it pretty much slows down to God

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.600 
be so it pretty much slows down to God
so<00:04:46.199> it's<00:04:46.740> easier<00:04:47.039> for<00:04:47.159> you<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.250> get<00:04:47.430> into

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
so it's easier for you to get into

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.159 
so it's easier for you to get into
higher<00:04:47.759> level<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.690> that's<00:04:48.810> what<00:04:48.990> power

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
higher level so that's what power

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.680 
higher level so that's what power
shifted<00:04:49.560> us<00:04:52.789> pushes<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:53.909> tools<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.449> slows

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
shifted us pushes the tools just slows

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.409 
shifted us pushes the tools just slows
it<00:04:54.840> down<00:04:54.870> more<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:56.639> life<00:04:56.879> recovery<00:04:57.300> just

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
it down more and a life recovery just
