00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and $170 for 2 gigabyte so my question

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850 
and $170 for 2 gigabyte so my question
to<00:01:47.340> consider<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:48.229> will<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.380> able<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to consider is will it be able to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
crossfire with the 7 770 and 7 750
because<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.969> 7700<00:01:56.969> GPUs<00:01:57.390> used<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.140> K<00:01:58.590> parity

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

650 TI and the gtx 660 which is a

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.390 
650 TI and the gtx 660 which is a
perfect<00:02:26.299> combination<00:02:26.599> between<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.349> two<00:02:27.530> so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
perfect combination between the two so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.860 
perfect combination between the two so
here<00:02:28.579> are<00:02:28.670> some<00:02:28.790> extra<00:02:29.180> details<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.750> be

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
here are some extra details to be

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.479 
here are some extra details to be
considered<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.859> card<00:02:31.159> is<00:02:31.280> actually

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
considered the card is actually

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.679 
considered the card is actually
comparable<00:02:32.450> against<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> 7/8<00:02:33.859> 50<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.609> it<00:02:35.540> can

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
comparable against a 7/8 50 and it can

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.440 
comparable against a 7/8 50 and it can
sli<00:02:36.200> unlike<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.859> 650<00:02:37.400> TI<00:02:37.609> meaning<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.269> can

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
sli unlike the 650 TI meaning you can

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.190 
sli unlike the 650 TI meaning you can
use<00:02:38.480> dual<00:02:38.959> GPU<00:02:40.090> configuration<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.780> also<00:02:41.930> comes

my<00:03:00.079> question<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.439> consider<00:03:00.650> for<00:03:01.129> this<00:03:01.340> GPU<00:03:01.849> is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
my question to consider for this GPU is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.119 
my question to consider for this GPU is
well<00:03:02.659> future<00:03:03.019> drivers<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> more

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
well future drivers make it more

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.270 
well future drivers make it more
powerful<00:03:04.579> than<00:03:04.879> the<00:03:05.030> 7<00:03:05.359> 850<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.769> don't<00:03:07.040> get<00:03:07.159> me

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
powerful than the 7 850 and don't get me

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.610 
powerful than the 7 850 and don't get me
wrong<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.790> 750<00:03:08.419> is<00:03:08.540> still<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> stronger<00:03:09.260> GPU

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
wrong the 750 is still a stronger GPU

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.879 
wrong the 750 is still a stronger GPU
overall<00:03:10.159> at<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.760> time<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:12.829> said

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
overall at this time but like I said

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.309 
overall at this time but like I said
future<00:03:13.609> drivers<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:14.150> make<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.419> NVIDIA<00:03:14.989> GTX

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
future drivers can make the NVIDIA GTX

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.330 
future drivers can make the NVIDIA GTX
650<00:03:16.010> Ti<00:03:16.639> boost<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.389> better<00:03:17.930> card<00:03:18.319> for<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> better

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
650 Ti boost a better card for a better

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.020 
650 Ti boost a better card for a better
price<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> when<00:03:21.799> comparing<00:03:22.159> both<00:03:22.430> cards<00:03:22.909> I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
price so when comparing both cards I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
price so when comparing both cards I
look<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.419> advantages<00:03:24.169> and

look for the advantages and
disadvantages<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.669> both<00:03:26.180> cards<00:03:26.659> so<00:03:27.290> for<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
disadvantages of both cards so for the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.890 
disadvantages of both cards so for the
advantages<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.250> both<00:03:28.489> cards<00:03:28.879> 277<00:03:29.629> nineties

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.559 
I think both cars are great while they
had<00:04:34.150> their<00:04:34.389> advantages<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.319> disadvantages
