well<00:00:33.180> there's<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> guess<00:00:35.360> obviously<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
well there's two I guess obviously the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
well there's two I guess obviously the
item<00:00:36.809> collection<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.559> don't<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
item collection I don't like that you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
item collection I don't like that you
have<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> find<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> items<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.840> order<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
have to find all the items in order to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.190 
have to find all the items in order to
make<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> castle<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.520> easier<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.989> just

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
make the castle that much easier it just

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.119 
make the castle that much easier it just
seems<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> busy<00:00:44.100> work

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
seems like a lot of busy work

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.500 
seems like a lot of busy work
considering<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> these<00:00:45.149> things<00:00:45.329> are

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
considering some of these things are

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
considering some of these things are
pretty<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:45.960> hidden<00:00:46.760> yeah<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.000> what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pretty well hidden yeah that's what

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
pretty well hidden yeah that's what
guides<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.469> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
guides are for but I don't really like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
guides are for but I don't really like
like<00:00:50.399> relying<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.120> those<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.170> because

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
like relying on those but also because

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.450 
like relying on those but also because
of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> tone<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.239> story<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> know
