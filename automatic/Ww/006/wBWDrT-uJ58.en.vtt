 young people 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.150
 and now there are two more helps 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 the owners have been sold at 5 4 percent more 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.140
 because they are not active October in the second round 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.099
 she would have to last week's 11 percent normal job 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.619
 with 5 4 want to blame 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.860
 in the words of then had been agreed 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.060
 century 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.450
 only two people is good i was the first quarter almost all concerned though 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.700
 now clearly reflected 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.390
 and that has consequences of bringing more special patterns with me and such 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 the TuS pretty funny Aires rather funny than 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 namely the EU 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 Euro almost 80 percent 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.260
 the possibly quite clear their colleagues from our canteen stand up 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.600
 Losses to millions of for example 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 Companies have been reported to report 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.820
 why should that be pretty pointless percent with these substances like that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 Shoot continuously 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.240

 Sister, of course, or no grandma coincidence, you are not both 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 Eagle then you press 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.170
 in the vicinity of the Brandenburger clothes the colleagues strongholds 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.630
 Unfortunately, you can not go on otherwise, for example, from the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.700
 Bach Dom just jump off so Zack 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 but yes that does not work that way 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.990
 So sometimes you can stop so Springer pretty smart that I can 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.250
 Not really, either, and the apple pears - that was 2 500 Euros Ilan 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.300
 So who wants now no smaller information should purpose and were 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.790

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.419
 Business associations and so on 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.069
 and then sometimes there were just like the Americans 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.969
 So far, few of them feared goal succeeded this last 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.620
 yes, some of them are very well known 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670
