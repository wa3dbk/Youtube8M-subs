00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 or you put her kids, we're here 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 new fifa video 15 and well this says 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.790
 in a new episode of the road to the first 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.530
 division let's go as you see we are in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 division 3 again let's see if 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
 this time as we get the promotion that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 not that it's costing a lot I do not want 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 do not even think about dividing all that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.500
 will come but good for now we are going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 focus on this is not going to get 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.910
 those 18 points and we're going to play the first 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 party said some changes that I'm going 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.920
 to teach to see edit I have put silva 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.080
 of defense as I have marcelo and diego 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 Well, it works pretty well 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 he simply loses two chemistry points 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 but by putting also the coach has 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 been that is an 8 if I had 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 another Spanish coach because he stayed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 in 7 it seems to me I've also put 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.739
 neymar for isco who wanted to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 try it because it touched me the other day in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.550
 the envelopes that is 87's is at 86 the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 normal and I wanted to try it from mc to see 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.410
 see how it works not after I have to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 messi I changed the position of messi and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 Griezmann I already mentioned that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 I would try to try them and they are flying 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 the player is talking to me two or three 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 matches and it shows 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.430
 the midfielder who is a little more 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.619
 fast not with Messi although Griezmann 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 it is, but you can escape like that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 better so let's see Griezmann 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 also it is better auctioneer not me yes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.799
 it is faster and for dribbling and that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 works better come because I go there 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.340
 played a game before this and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.500
 lost 10 has scored a goal for me 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 penalty and I have had at least three or 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.490
 four clear enough times if not 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.830
 we managed to get a good one to hunt 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 slope vale do not have bad equipment this 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.500
 man from before had to robben everything to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.539
 out through also had at least 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.149
 five to the two defenses bat and naldo 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.399
 direct a lot of everyone and at the end 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.280
 then we have been that 10 and by penalty 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.409

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.479

 I can fail that fuck as it makes sure 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.639
 a little bit but it is that you do not see yet the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.630
 I could Arbás where we'll baldi 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.630
 cheer up 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.090
 we go 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.570
 the hubble as I live to it I make a 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.510
 this dangerous hardware also a 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.480
 defect catches a kid grenade no longer 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.550
 nothing remains 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.920
 but obviously there is nothing left but 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.620
 gets me another does not matter does not matter does not pass 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.540
 nothing fuck kid, at least I got 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.880
 a couple there at the last minute that I was 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.310
 costing quite the first part for 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.050
 it has not been bad and in the end 2 to 3 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.610
 I was not doing a little silly there 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.980
 last minute and I got another one but 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.020
 good and let's take advantage so nothing 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.230
 we have three moment and two points 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.690
 good matches we have started more or 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.980
 less well you could not tell to see if 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.080
 we manage to win there are two or three 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.940
 followed, we do not start, thus ensuring 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.520
 the first victories because if not 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.410
 then the season gets very complicated 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.360
 not in the last matches of normal it 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.100
 always complicates but well there is a 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.890
 see if he tells me this game because 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.620
 Yesterday I left the game they did not tell me 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.260
 points and eight games remaining so 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.330
 that we could lose even three yet 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.530
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.530
 And until next time
