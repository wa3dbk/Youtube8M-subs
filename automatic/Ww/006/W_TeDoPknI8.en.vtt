00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.560 
now we would cook off all the alcohol
while<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.900> were<00:03:04.990> simmering<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.820> if<00:03:06.820> you're<00:03:07.450> in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
while we were simmering and if you're in

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.600 
while we were simmering and if you're in
an<00:03:07.720> enclosed<00:03:07.840> area<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:09.130> vaporized

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
an enclosed area and you vaporized

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.670 
an enclosed area and you vaporized
enough<00:03:09.970> alcohol<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.780> an<00:03:10.900> open<00:03:11.200> heat<00:03:11.380> source

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
enough alcohol with an open heat source

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.520 
enough alcohol with an open heat source
it<00:03:12.550> would<00:03:12.970> explode<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:14.020> don't<00:03:14.200> need<00:03:14.320> that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
it would explode and we don't need that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.610 
it would explode and we don't need that
either<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:16.000> we're<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.050> let<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.380> sit

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
either so we're going to let this sit

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.350 
either so we're going to let this sit
for<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> half<00:03:17.920> an<00:03:18.220> hour<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.970> then<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:19.210> going<00:03:19.300> to

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
don't need this but if you have a proof

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.270 
don't need this but if you have a proof
and<00:04:16.209> trail<00:04:16.510> hydrometer<00:04:17.230> test<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.830> proof<00:04:18.040> with

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and trail hydrometer test the proof with

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.280 
and trail hydrometer test the proof with
distilled<00:04:18.640> spirits<00:04:19.150> we're<00:04:19.930> going<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.140> use

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
distilled spirits we're going to use

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.520 
distilled spirits we're going to use
this<00:04:20.500> right<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:21.010> find<00:04:21.910> out<00:04:22.290> exactly<00:04:23.290> how

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
this right now find out exactly how

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:50.719 
this right now find out exactly how
strong<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.100> is

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:05:09.080 

and<00:04:51.729> we<00:04:52.690> have

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.560 

50<00:05:09.840> proof<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.400> cut<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.850> alcohol<00:05:11.970> level

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
50 proof so it cut the alcohol level

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.860 
50 proof so it cut the alcohol level
down<00:05:12.750> by<00:05:12.960> half<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:14.550> that's<00:05:14.760> not<00:05:15.000> bad<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.570> what

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
down by half but that's not bad is what

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.840 
down by half but that's not bad is what
we're<00:05:16.080> going<00:05:16.350> forward<00:05:16.710> this<00:05:16.890> recipe<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.550> taste

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
we're going forward this recipe is taste
