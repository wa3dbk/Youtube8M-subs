00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good kids here we are in the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.660
 next part of the run guide 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.519
 totem in life that I will not comment on 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.389
 life for the simple reason that I have 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.700
 I lost audio I explain I got it 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 to comment in round 30 and in this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 moment I was saying kids 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.279
 has commented on this in this round 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.630
 because before I wanted to be concentrated 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.630
 now it seems that it is a little easier 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.660
 I am also told you that I am angry 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.960
 lose the audio because I was commenting 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.360
 that I was going to give the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.000
 departure and I am saying how 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.340
 pussy are you going to give away the game well then 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 this map is quite difficult then 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.080
 at the moment you start to comment 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.690
 you lose concentration and it's easier 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.790
 that you are killed, you are going to see death 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
 end you know to see death at the end 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.500
 of the video and you see how it is a lack of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.860
 total concentration or what happens to me 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.330
 it's awesome but I think 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 you have at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.100
 comment gave them this then it fucks me 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.330
 I would like it to have is to listen 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.979
 comments like because the truth is that 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.180
 I was doing pretty well besides 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.460
 was explaining everything he did in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.140
 every moment and now then it is not what 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.090
 same because I've already said it once 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.369
 so I do not know if now it's going to be the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.659
 second time I repeat it the third one is 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.100
 a bitch when you comment something and 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.830
 you lose the audio is the worst there is but 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.140
 well let's try to see you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.369
 I explain the strategy as they go 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.860
 climbing rounds is becoming easier 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.450
 As you are already seeing, you see this 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.440
 zombie has come on the one hand that does not touch 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.980
 then I have to shoot 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.410
 in a way that is not the best because 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.510
 then now there are a few 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.890
 had to fire the other shot to 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.120
 that comes to the whole wave and also 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.880
 let me thunder with the two bullets and 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.650
 well let's go to the mess right now the stand 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.270
 that we are going to put it is not only the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.530
 let's shoot to save us it's worth 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.720
 not only we have two bullets left then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.130
 we have to look for ammunition 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.780
 Well, we do not do the trip if you 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
 you always look from the same place 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.680
 always several from this pillar to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640
 this here that I'm going to happen right now 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.530
 and I surround it and again once I 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 a zombie came from behind the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.120
 pillar but a strange thing because 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.910
 it was the return voucher I do not know exactly in 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.100
 what a round it was or anything but well I know 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
 has happened to me and that has been quite 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.150
 I miss you well, look , we already have it 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.460
 they arrive very fast and to find this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.200
 site that I like to shoot that 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.220
 it seems I do not know if exactly if all the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.780
 world shoots and when they do the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.980
 strategy I have seen strategy with 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.810
 sandler just had never seen the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 strategy that you use when you go 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.120
 when they are going to take out the ammunition 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.250
 but good to find this site I like 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.140
 this site so the 100 there from here 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.330
 we get the instant low and a 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.340
 ammunition and what we do is plant the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.940
 monkey and prepare us the one that not simply 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.770
 is to shoot to advance the round is 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.360
 I think practically when it ends 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.220
 When you take the bomb, the round is over 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.930
 It bothers me enough to have to be 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.010
 commenting this after having done it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.540
 really since I've given away the game 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.459
 commenting on life as not what 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 pussy that does not lose the audio putt and I do not know 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.090
 why it has been lost is worth it as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.300
 be half blocked from the program the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 capturing and has only recorded 100 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.959
 seconds the pockets of the records 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.670
 very little he has also made this video 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.220
 in 2000 in two videos when that's not 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.060
 has to do it ever but good 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.130
 I'm going ready round 30 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
 let's talk about the still been just 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.190
 to explain everything give death as 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.890
 so it has been amazing 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.959
 well here was commenting that I 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.959
 like to start the round here yes it can be 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.000
 so that the whole answer from the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.349
 staircase is worth it because everything will come 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.660
 is going to come roughly half of 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.040
 the zombies this now every time 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.130
 it interests less at the beginning yes that 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.330
 he was very interested because he answers 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.380
 much slower then interesting that 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.030
 come all over there do not go coming 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.700
 because all the windows here 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.530
 go blocking and everything so the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.090
 principle is very interesting but starting 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.430
 of a round 30 like in which I'm 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.560
 now really if he does something but 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.170
 but it is not necessary, because as if 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.790
 you notice you already put them very fast when 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.069
 I see that they are going to block me here vague 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.780
 notice that what I am doing 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.489
 come to this area as soon as I just 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.330
 you can do from this round if 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.280
 that you do in round 20 little 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.840
 the zombies children will block to the return 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.970
 you see how there was only one left to come and 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.320
 now the one that I had the window 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.200
 then that is because we are in a 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.910
 round and half Balearic an action to rent 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.310
 high although for this map then it is 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.460
 a quite high area but it is not but 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.410
 It is not so much in that aspect 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.990
 that the faster the backup is 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.670
 of round 30 is already pretty decent 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 then in a row you can and that area 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.380
 and finish putting them together and it's going to be a lot 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.960
 easier to go to the difficult to be born 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.480
 a totem are the first observations 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.860
 do not enter round 10 and round 20 more or 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.790
 less is the hardest thing there is because 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.640
 here you read that you have to do 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.020
 many more that is about extras that I do 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.330
 but hey, look how it is all the time 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.030
 from one pillar to another you see how sometimes 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.650
 they open up a lot again this zombie comes to me 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.300
 where you should not normally out there 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.920
 they block me and another turn 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.020
 quietly now and there's no problem 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.310
 so it's my turn to shoot again if 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.940
 I would have had little ammunition 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.770
 better I would have tried to shoot at 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.180
 the whole ball to take my eyes off one 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.810
 of the things that I said is that now 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.520
 I just remembered what it is that when 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.100
 have a shot of the flag 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.290
 when I do not forgive when you have astander 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.020
 in any on any map it's worth it 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.060
 not only on h on any map and you 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.520
 you are forced to shoot fixed veis 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.350
 will fix and soon tell me be good 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.650
 simply more clear is the final death 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.960
 vale vale goes really beige where I finish 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.050
 to die or that is a fail that is in 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.669
 any rule related to entering what 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.649
 Pussy I say that's a fail 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.559
 completely that is no longer mythical and of 

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:53.659
 truth is a fucking face that goes through 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.089
 have commented the fucking video basically 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.559
 because I can guarantee you that if that 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.479
 I'm not commenting on that video there, I do not 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.059
 kill I'm not going to tell you that there 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.529
 reached 50 or when doing the pull or not 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.040
 I'm going to say it but I can 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:09.220
 say that there does not kill me chin 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.910
 if I get to not commenting, it's worth it 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.290
 that nothing else 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.550
 tell you to have a whole game 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.010
 recorded although I think it's in two 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.720
 videos but I have it recorded and here if 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.100
 want to see because I do note that in 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.760
 comments the like if I had to 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.380
 catch many likes this video that you 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.730
 like then I can upload the game 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.900
 whole is not commented so good 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.060
 I would like to give you some music 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.250
 copyright or I would simply put the round 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.750
 I 'm not going to comment on it later 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.240
 the whole game because we're going is a 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.470
 This friend is engaged because here I spent 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.120
 It is here I happened to others Look 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.710
 how that is, I did not remember that I 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.820
 they had killed had been been greater and 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.000
 even unforeseen 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.350
 and finally good, you just commented 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.120
 others of chance 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.970
 this is for all the maps when 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.200
 take astander on the shoulder and go 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.170
 block them they are forced to 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.030
 shoot if you can try to aim at 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.160
 maximum number of zombies that you can 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.780
 look there was indicating where I 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.620
 blocks is already saying that they have been 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.050
 basically because of this being 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.760
 commenting let's go so it's worth the 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.680
 under whenever you see 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.240
 forced to shoot to protect you from 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.980
 block us then try to shoot 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.040
 to as many zombies as possible and so 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.710
 Well, do not you go that transformers nothing 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.680
 more what I said I'm not going to also 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.300
 we complain I have commented in live that it has 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.770
 lost the audio that I was not going to play 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.780
 now because I did not want to go back to 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.120
 play but yes I have pending 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.080
 play again and instead of communicating the 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.940
 30 connect in 40 and I'll start 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.070
 comment there everything goes and it's ok 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.690
 there he was explaining that that which is of 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.900
 side by side that is always the same 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:44.389
 movement and there I do not know what the fuck 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.680

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.660

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.570
