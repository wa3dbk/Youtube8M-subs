green<00:00:58.399> she'll<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.780> guess<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:00.989> felt<00:01:01.320> cool

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
green she'll I guess we just felt cool

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
green she'll I guess we just felt cool
because<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.859> had<00:01:01.980> another<00:01:02.219> accessory<00:01:02.699> we

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
because we had another accessory we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
because we had another accessory we
could<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.210> our<00:01:03.329> faces<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
could put on our faces and then of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
could put on our faces and then of
course<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.439> started<00:01:04.619> getting<00:01:04.949> attention

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
course I started getting attention

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.800 
course I started getting attention
probably<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
probably because not a lot of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
probably because not a lot of
kindergarteners<00:01:07.530> need<00:01:07.860> glasses<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> age

yeah well if you wear glasses you can

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
yeah well if you wear glasses you can
probably<00:01:10.770> relate<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.470> like

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
probably relate to this it's not like

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.170 
probably relate to this it's not like
we're<00:01:13.770> gonna<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.040> extra<00:01:14.310> fingers<00:01:14.700> more

logical<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> testing<00:01:16.049> someone's<00:01:16.470> vision

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
logical way of testing someone's vision

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
logical way of testing someone's vision
would<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> take<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> book<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> say<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:18.840> 1

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
would be to take a book and say put me 1

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.660 
would be to take a book and say put me 1
the<00:01:19.170> word<00:01:19.320> start<00:01:19.650> getting<00:01:19.979> learning<00:01:20.369> or
