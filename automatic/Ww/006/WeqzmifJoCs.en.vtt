00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.090
 th 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.380
 Yes 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.380
 It is a product review 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.770
 Headlight gtr 931 h 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.850
 is 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.020
 I do not know what 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.020
 I will open 10 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.950
 Good 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.080
 Kuhyeon and 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.710
 Please see 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:40.030
 It's a mess and I opened it once 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.220
 Because it can not be stored in the original way, it looks like this line with rubber bands 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.200
 It was just a summary 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.030
 Originally pretty ugly- 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.310
 I will say to this head 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.790
 Not a headgear 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.190
 Part of the headband 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.500
 It was well organized 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.870
 This is the same head ride as I said before love 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.830
 It is a headlamp 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 Why I bought a headlight 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.060
 Do you say that flash light is a drawback of the hand of the well 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:21.100
 When you walk on your own night 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.230
 In the case of me , in order to look for that kind of that blue flame of that bonfire 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.190
 that 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.490
 I was looking for the necessary light and it was cheap 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.090
 How much 900 yen 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:39.250
 Around 900 yen 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 900 It becomes such a price at the price of Amazon which is 941 yen 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.050
 Frog in my pocket money 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.900
 Because it is a price 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.910
 I was here 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.670
 Head Ride Why am I really going to buy any book and cry 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.759
 To briefly explain the outline 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.580
 It says Rutte increasing the level of the write 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.150
 45 name 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.630
 It seems that 45 lumens is a little what lumens 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.360
 I have to say riding of what unit I'm a little I do not know a little 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:15.150
 But it is possible to Tsu strength of reasonable light 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:21.020
 The reachable distance to the end with no irradiation distance is 77m 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:24.770
 It is convenient to the straight line is look for a positive Sae Ei 77 meters away 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:31.330
 In Korea Metropolitan if there is the high mode to take you mode Dotteyuu that of 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:33.780
 If it is the low mode, it will be 24 hours with 1 AA battery 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 When the little no I Bie 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.620
 It looks like you can actually do it 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.920
 This pana's in the same package 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.099
 There was a battery at the light station 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.390
 A little 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.730
 I will try to put 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.940
 It was the surroundings for during this illusion easy day in this Sugge this hard 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.110
 Yasushima was a bit slow 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.110
 How is this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.640
 2 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:08.200
 Battery failure 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.200
 It was like put in place a flame or + was surprised Truly hard 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.970
 I did this 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.970
 Please tighten 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.970
 The 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.200
 Put away lightly 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.470
 We put pride 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.300
 The button is here 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.319
 a's ok 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.270
 this 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.160
 Example 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.080
 this 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 this 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.380
 right 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.850
 I'm able to do it, so here's a room 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.530
 I have electricity 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.860
 Never see 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.350
 Was put out that the electrical I feel that Don 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.530
 Here 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.280
 This is high mode now 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.220
 Quite 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.110
 From quite the air your gold 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.930
 This center 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:09.549
 It is a feeling that the center is already very light and it spreads like this 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.549
 I will try to leave a little while 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.079
 how is it 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.320
 this is 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.639
 I wonder if it 's about 4m 3m away 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.060
 cover 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.400
 3 rooms I did not to the people both 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.969
 Around 2m 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.319
 I do not feel like this 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.319
 I wonder if it is bright 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:46.760
 This is the low mode is just the early mode 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:51.150
 Now it's about to go high mode and it's not blinking at all, but I'm not using it at all in the flashing mode 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.320
 It is bright enough even in low mode 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.330
 In Well 24 hours AA batteries one 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.349
 if possible 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.349
 I guess it's not good 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.290
 I feel like it is not good 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.660
 Yes 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.169

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.960
 Light 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.740
 It was for those who are looking for light 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:37.910
 I think it's probably a good idea 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:42.139
 Koso part of this head band 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.379
 It's already good that I can strengthen in well 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:50.360
 I can not fascinate my sister 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:53.380

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.930
 Because I bought that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.930
 It feels like it's such a fit 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.900
