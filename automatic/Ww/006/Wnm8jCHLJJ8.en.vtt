00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.460 
you know that would make me feel tense
so<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:30.940> using<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.330> sound<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.780> makes<00:03:31.840> me<00:03:32.140> relax

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
so I'm using a sound that makes me relax

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.920 
so I'm using a sound that makes me relax
and<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.430> if<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.000> clapping<00:03:34.360> hands<00:03:34.600> make<00:03:34.810> you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
and so if the clapping hands make you

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.210 
and so if the clapping hands make you
relaxed<00:03:35.260> that's<00:03:35.500> what<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> dog<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:35.980> going<00:03:36.130> to

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
relaxed that's what the dog is going to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.520 
relaxed that's what the dog is going to
get<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.580> which<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.050> much<00:03:38.260> what

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
get so which it's not so much what

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.260 
get so which it's not so much what
creates<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.220> outcome<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.760> energy<00:03:40.240> that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
creates the outcome is the energy that

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.260 
creates the outcome is the energy that
is<00:03:40.990> inside<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.070> know<00:03:42.160> before<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> sound<00:03:43.000> I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
is inside of you know before the sound I

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.180 
is inside of you know before the sound I
