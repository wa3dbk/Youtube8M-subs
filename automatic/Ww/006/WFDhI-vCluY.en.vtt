00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.660
 I can say a little something 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 only narrator was what was here on the apparatus 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 if you think of friedel Münch left 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.769
 of course first of all 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.389
 four-cylinder motorcycles and that is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.250
 certainly undoubtedly right of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 motorcycle has been created by a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.289
 order from jean-marie i hope you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 have pronounced it 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.150
 these french were business premises of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.760
 gear he has münch the nurses münch 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.529
 getting the brakes bought out maybe 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.910
 filmstar once again the brake 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.829
 explicitly this brake has so morin through 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 and got lots of it because of that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 the common at friedel münch and 1964 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 the friedel münch has the order 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350
 given but a road machine 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 to build 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 Munich 2 plus had contacts to horex 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 then constructed frame and then has 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.070
 This street machine is developed 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.270
 there are still racing machines in parallel 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.299
 were built with the same frame 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.830
 essential identifying features are 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:17.369
 once the back wheel heavy 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:21.890
 magnesium then logically the two 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:26.570
 Brake fault is a hallmark 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 the crossed frame here in front 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.829
 You can tell by that that the little one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.159
 series ex frame is 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.700
 base is a 450 cubic centimeter 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:43.119
 imperator motor then modified 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.409
 has its own crankshaft 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.499
 typical of friedel münch then the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.109
 construction with weber double carburettor 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.369
 motorcycle is in 1967 in france 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.759
 admitted 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.259
 based on the chassis number and us 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 Present details can be very clear 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.630
 that's really proven 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 the probably first street machine is the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.299
 Friedel Münch has also built here 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.720
 the side quite typical of magnesium 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:15.829
 Cover this cover you will find then 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.269
 again at the racing machines we 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.959
 be this motorcycle now once 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.760
 start 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.430
 we got in the motorcycle with the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.129
 past months very intense 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.239
 deals once to check the history 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:32.810
 and then we are in the first place 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.590
 dealt with electrics because at the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.200
 Machine is in the course of many years 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.000
 just lost the electric 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
 can one say the motorcycle then in the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.319
 Nobody noticed 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.450
 we have the electrics back in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.340
 properly brought maybe you can 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.519
 show our red one for us 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.049
 now have the side housing full sun 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.870
 that we do not have this typical lid 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.310
 have more on it now have a 12 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.810
 volt alternator installed 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.849
 We have that individually to the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.190
 Machine adapted and happy that 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.750
 that everything goes well together 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.000
 and now we want that in one 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.519
 small video demonstrating motor is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.780
 cold and we just become authentic 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.310
 show how that works and that's what I'm doing 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.609
 luck for this purpose here in front 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.710
 then we make our gasoline 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.730
 Points 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.730
 I hope that partner 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.890
 of advantage is of course the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.100
 pulls out of it because then she runs 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.100
 not so nice and make people on 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.030
 I'll just do it again 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.200
 Pick the company just fine if the one 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.200
 has announced a bit
