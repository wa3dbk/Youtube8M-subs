00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.350
 to confirm water quality and 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.129
 drinking water systems 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.279
 we turned laboratory at 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.839
 Health Ministry of the Russian Federation 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.619
 who heads the famous 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.869
 explorer properties and structure 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.560
 water 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 Doctor of Biological Sciences Stanislav 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.220
 Argentine Cesena 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.390
 for the experiment we installed the system 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.619
 drinking water of roses directly 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 laboratories and hooked her code 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.370
 weather 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.650
 for research we took three water samples 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.720
 the first test teeth wiring networks 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 which is connected to the system 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.340
 the second traffic jams where that immediately after the membrane 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.930
 reverse osmosis and in quality 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.970
 corresponds to water and purchasing systems 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.970
 reverse osmosis filtration 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.120
 meeting the set test at the exit rose system 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 after structuring 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.140
 water research results in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.790
 these three samples will show us how 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 changing the structure of the water during the passage 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 through the drinking water system growth 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 It is also important to identify a qualitative difference. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.159
 drinking water systems 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.000
 Russia 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 Purified Purified Strainer 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.260
 fellow nomos nose 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.030
 the essence of the research is in comparison 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.550
 water structures sampled from neutral 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.110
 state 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.920
 laboratory equipment 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.479
 allows to quantify 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.800
 estimate the difference 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.390
 see numbers 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 how much the sample tank structure 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.780
 positive or negative 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.890
 the side will be different as 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 neutral waters 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.810
 research conducted by the method 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.410
 approved 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.640
 Academic Council of the Ministry of Health 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Health Ministry of the Russian Federation 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.459
 based on patent 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.569
 was developed 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 at 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.689
 laboratory 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.719
 scientific substantiation of traditional methods 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.849
 diagnosis and treatment 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.069
 all federal 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 center 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.719
 on this resource 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.619
 water test results 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.289
 from drinking systems 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.969
 rose logic 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.759
 mh then something happens that figure 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.759
 will increase 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.109
 is given 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.959
 the book is written check yes this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 rythr ordinary actions 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.219
 our sample prepare means 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.939
 the access waitress we use 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.139
 for this purpose 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.419
 here you can see that from this environment r 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 medalist 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 this is usually characteristic influence 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.009
 concerning 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.579
 who using the system 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.769
 there is water 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.589
 main honor 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.269
 in the letter the water after the murder 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.359
 she is changing her structure in Odessa 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.609
 condition 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.699
 cleaning is cleaning of the world in 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.669
 excited state which 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.069
 after cleaning 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.499
 happens 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.279
 you can usually imagine the founder 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:37.809
 facebook 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:38.989
 slightly stirred up 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.209
 water structure 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.489
 so analytic properties resound 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.289
 enemies 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.559
 old close to those who are the most 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.559
 favorable for our body 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.659
 in the growth system 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.719
 the device we call 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.009
 structures 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.579
 water structures 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.579
 after your system growth 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.519
 we begin is 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.829
 Here's a view 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.829
 under the tutelage of may when here rise on 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.979
 below zero 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.029
 starts to approach 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.740
 go edge 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.690
 there care depending on 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.189
 which are characteristic 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.139
 to influence 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.080
 spring award of the Moscow region 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.259
 so we have no right to sign 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.610
 say that the date is evidence of that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.210
 what he 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.710
 drinking water system rus 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.710
 allows not only to clean the water we 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.159
 translate her 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.150
 ok with historians condition 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.350
 or rather what is your own 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.220
 the state which is the most 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.789
 favorable 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.669
 for our body
