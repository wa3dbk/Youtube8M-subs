with the increased prices but our risk

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.830 
with the increased prices but our risk

now<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:44.919> thousand<00:04:45.639> we've<00:04:46.060> just<00:04:46.270> doubled<00:04:46.539> the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
now a thousand we've just doubled the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.510 
now a thousand we've just doubled the
risk<00:04:47.050> because<00:04:47.410> all<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.710> our<00:04:47.919> expenses<00:04:48.400> have

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
risk because all of our expenses have

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.400 
risk because all of our expenses have
doubled<00:04:48.849> along<00:04:49.060> with<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.840> have<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.289> be

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
doubled along with it so I have to be

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.960 
doubled along with it so I have to be
