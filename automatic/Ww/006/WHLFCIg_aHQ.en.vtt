 channel how to configure in this short 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 gave a versus of samsung galaxy s 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.509
 5 recently put on the market 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.849
 presented this February 24 against 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 samsung galaxy s 4 his younger brother 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 we have the last two book badges 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 of the samsung family fast samsung but 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 bankers invite you to subscribe to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 our channel in that way can we 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 leave questions comments and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.449
 suggestions and be aware of all 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.940
 our videos we have already made two 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.790
 previous videos to be in 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.649
 our channel 11 we talked about the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 news the main novelties of the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.390
 samsung galaxy s 5 and in the other the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 main characteristics of this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 phone we also talk about the price 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 soon here we will also touch the price 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.110
 but here again basically what 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 we want is to compare these two phones 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.810
 65 is the c4 to begin 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.230
 s5 battery and increased the 2800 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.580
 milliamp universes 2600 milliamps 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.860
 That gives us a lot longer 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 conversation much longer before 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.120
 standby and much more fun time 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.390
 with our phone the processor of 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.390
 s5 is superior is also a processor 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 2.5 GHz against a processor 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.119
 1.9 megahertz the main chamber of the s5 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.479
 it is also superior 16 megapixels 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.700
 against the 13 megapixels of the camera 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.190
 main the front ones are very 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.410
 similar the s5 is 2.1 and the lc 4 is 2.0 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.720
 Screen size are very similar 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.890
 however it is slightly larger the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 of the s5 5.1 inches against 5 inches the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 Megapixel density is 3.2 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.659
 megapixels cons 2 megapixels of ls 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.210
 4 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.590
 in terms of image stabilization 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.049
 allows it in real time the 594 s is not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.679
 Water resistant is a complete 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.170
 Novelty of the S5 comes with a protection 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.870
 of dust and water however the phone 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.209
 it's not waterproof completely it 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.620
 saying you can submerge as such 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.870
 although they have a protection of 367 that 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.590
 allows this protection against 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.799
 water and the file download of the s5 is 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.870
 then we can download up to 150 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.760
 megabits per second against 100 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.440
 megabits on 3 and 4 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.470
 these hundred find megabits it 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.040
 they get thanks thanks to a system that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.799
 allows to integrate the led with the wifi and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 that way between two systems download 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.650
 much faster 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.980
 the video recording is much better in 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.069
 the c5 allows already record in ultra video 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.319
 hd against the cool h of the system 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:03.510
 the TVs with the previous ones here like 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:05.790
 record in 2.160 versus 2080 the ass h 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.310
 that is, we can record with a lot 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 higher resolution 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.020
 The s5 has ips lc4 panel not the monitor 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.060
 cardiac is also a novelty in the s5 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.550
 and in the back part of the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.220
 flash is the cardiac sensor in saying 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.920
 we put our finger there we can 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.050
 register our our pulsations and 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.030
 see what is our state's 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.599
 our heart when we are doing 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.900
 sport or something like the autofocus ls 5 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.760
 it's much faster and basically says 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.209
 that has a car because faster the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.739
 market is 0.3 seconds sensor 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.549
 fingerprints is also a 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.470
 novelty in the c5 something that does not have the c4 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.080
 and sensor I'm going to three pillars of c5 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.049
 works by sliding your finger on the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.610
 home button or home and basically to 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.500
 difference from your competitor who only 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.680
 put your finger here we must slide the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.780
 tele the finger on the home button this 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.420
 the biometric sensor is basically going to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.030
 allow disable and activate the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.739
 phone in addition to that in the future will 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.140
 allow online shopping that 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.700
 need our footprint and in addition to 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.350
 that we can configure up to three 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.120
 different accounts for three users 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.430
 different that can use our 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.079
 phone 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.000
 differences we also have in the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.940
 dimensions basically the s5 is more 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.340
 thick is heavier a little bit more 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.330
 weighed the front camera as I had 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 said is of higher resolution 2 points 2 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.340
 megapixels against the 2 megapixels of the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.830
 ecce 4 most advanced operating system 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.520
 ss 5 already comes with the latest version of the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.449
 Android 4.2 operating system removes the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.419
 s4 comes with the 4.2 points 8 levin without 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.060
 However, the day of the release on the 5th 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.190
 launched the update removes at 13 4 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.780
 the talk time is much higher 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.270
 21 hours 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.370
 versus the 7 hours of conversation of the s 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.590
 4 basically those are all 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.110
 main characteristics there are 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.360
 highlight also that the 5 s comes with 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.250
 a function that allows 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.110
 to save a lot more batteries has a 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.729
 system that immediately when the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.639
 phone is at 10% turn off wifi and 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.409
 data applications and by that screen in 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.889
 black and white so that only 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:31.620
 allows you to enter those calls in addition to 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:35.430
 that the s5 comes with a function for 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.669
 children which makes that by activating it alone 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.129
 permission permit which is used 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.050
 the egg applications and I think that 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.189
 must block the navigation also to 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.020
 the phone 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.330
 basically that was it for this video 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.090
 those are the main faces 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.120
 Differences between the Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.520
 and the samsung galaxy s 4g soon became 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.599
 on the outside some difference or something that 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.849
 the different ones or that we do not have 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.420
 mentioned I invite you to leave the 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.850
 Comment tell us what you think 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.440
 and I did not mention it well subscribe to 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.360

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.550
 our videos are in taste
