00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.859
 to me 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 of what is the stanghelle illustration and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 such we have always liked a lot ibáñez 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.789
 the truth beyond there too I 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.099
 I think there has been a lot of influence from 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 series that come from outside especially the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.029
 theme of drawing series as futurama 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 father of family and such 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.110
 I think that influence has influenced 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 much on the subject on the subject of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.760
 funds some people have told us 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.600
 that the theme of the funds was to have a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 very European touch of such more than such and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.090
 well, no, it has not been any 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 no premeditated idea because to the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.400
 at the time of developing the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.440
 funds we have to do something that 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.270
 he was very cool he also has a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.340
 true touch maybe 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.230
 American because of the fact that 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.270
 Fire stairs of type 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.370
 New York and those things but 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.440
 neither was it an intention to do 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.690
 that it was a game that happens in the USA 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.770
 but a little bit everything that we have lived in 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.510
 our childhood through the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.860
 television all the movies that we 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.890
 came and such goods that those of 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.500
 fire the floors had cooking kitchen 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.790
 dining room and those things and well we've 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.480
 gone a lot in series and such 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.620
 but good is a game made here and 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.720
 some of some things have to 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.130
 result somewhere that's for sure not 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.270
 we had to do no starter 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.140
 luckily and we have found 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 financing but yes that is an idea that 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.460
 emerged between two colleagues taking reeds and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.710
 one day we are going to make an adventure 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.800
 graphic of which of which we already 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.180
 they did in since the 90's and that already makes 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.460
 many years ago when the panorama 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.440
 indie had not yet had not exploded 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.210
 as now, now the indie panorama 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.620
 it's at the top but it's six 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.070
 years that 's when we started to fool around 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.720
 with the idea of a graphic adventure 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.160
 honoring the 80s and those series 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 that our childhood had influenced us 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.320
 very much because the panorama of the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.670
 graphic adventures was a little more 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.759
 abandoned of what is now that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.220
 now it is in everything high then that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.369
 It is a very personal project because 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.070
 during the first four years it was 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.220
 something between two friends something not 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.020
 I pretended that I did not want much 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.830
 and that the only thing he asked for was the only 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.170
 what he intended was to have fun was something 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.430
 and for us to do a little 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 graphic adventure that we 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.800
 I would have liked them to do it then 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.480
 we had total freedom to catch and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.580
 dump our childhood and all our 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.160
 references something that we 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.990
 will fill what happened that after a lot 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.270
 working time and after many 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.890
 years we decided to get down to work 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.890
 as a trailer try to search 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 something not to finance but to look for 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.330
 the project will be able to do 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.550
 reality then back then 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.590
 put to mind and had resurfaced and there was 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 advanced a lot and we had seen what 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.250
 what could be done with crowdfunding 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.890
 but we were very afraid because if 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 well we had seen tim schafer do 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.269
 very crazy things with crowdfunding 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.540
 we had also seen pendulum studios 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.870
 do not get it with indigo I think it was and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.019
 if that pendulum studios that have been a 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.160
 exponent in the Spanish referent in the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.989
 new graphic adventure via getting 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.420
 we had nothing to do 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.630
 then we decided to present a trailer 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.430
 to different companies to upload it to media 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.560
 and see what happened we had very good 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.390
 feedback people liked a lot and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.709
 we started to start playing certain 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.090
 doors we speak with the dalí that 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.489
 We speak with several Spanish companies 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.530
 they were interested and they offered us 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.890
 financing thanks to a trailer already 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.959
 already a project and then dali too 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.819
 wanted to join the project and sign with 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.560
 us and thank god did not make us 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.420
 is missing although from the beginning we had 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.650
 thought that without anything he had if we did not 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.830
 we continue in another way we would do a 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.060
 kickstarter like 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.550
 alternative if at the beginning it's a bit 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.510
 crazy this is going through that phase of 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.540
 storm idea is a very crazy phase and the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.880
 project in our case it went a bit 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.069
 making the sun gives a feeling that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.050
 We were releasing ideas and there was a moment 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.940
 in which some ideas do not end 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.850
 convince us to have certain ideas 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.450
 that said them if you did not have to start 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.820
 anyone 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 they immediately framed oysters that's a 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.530
 great idea and based on those ideas that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.380
 they square from the beginning started to 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.470
 arise and it started to get very big to 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.750
 a huge speed at first only 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.090
 We would spend weekends talking 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.790
 work on the project and after a 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.410
 four-hour session talking and 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.080
 releasing ideas we realized that 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.240
 that the game had grown a lot 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.610
 and to capture the best after those 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.410
 ideas on paper we needed a week 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.700
 of oysters let's square all this well 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.440
 and such that the project went away 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.570
 doing a little bit alone so to speak 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.690
 to see beyond the nostalgia I think 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.630
 that something they have is that they have a 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.580
 history perhaps much more complex 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.890
 of what other popular titles 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.540
 they do as on the one hand they sacrifice certain 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.880
 playability 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.730
 it relies heavily on scripts and 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.550
 some dialogues much more developed 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.890
 apart from the good feeling of 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.390
 overcome puzzles and make certain 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.520
 combinations that make you involve yourself 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.000
 otherwise the end is like a 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.800
 kind of 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.570
 of interactive film that so 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.890
 criticized are public today 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.110
 of interactive but graphic culture 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.080
 they are a little that and the truth is that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.760
 apart from the nostalgia I think it is 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.020
 very well how will they arise because because 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.030
 it was a pity that something like this went up 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.000
 I would have left a bit of a good side 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.010
 from outside I think that the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.890
 development is there has not been a moment 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.050
 better since since I was a 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:50.850
 I believe that from the spektrum and 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.470
 so golden that time no no no not 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.320
 there was a moment until the day of 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.580
 today because the amount of titles 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.350
 incredible that are coming out not only 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.130
 in graphic adventures I think there's a 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:06.540
 movement very very very interesting indie 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:10.320
 to this day and from the internal issue 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.860
 I believe that all this is due a little to 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.360
 the desire to 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.430
 to get ahead even though many 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.409
 difficulties that we have in the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.360
 Today I think it is part of a 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.900
 movement of people who have played and have 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.479
 spent all childhood with games of 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.669
 and before all to the difficult 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:35.990
 panorama that there is of work has decided 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:38.599
 make from your hobbies a 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.800
 profession and I think today in 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.659
 Spain 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.629
 if the thing goes on like this let's go to 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.520
 earn us a place in the development to 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:49.250
 world level words that very good 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.759
 environment because all practically 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:55.400
 we share a very similar story and 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.740
 a purpose and the truth that all 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.240
 we share the same tastes and all the 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.760
 true that there is a lot of companionship 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.220
 with other studies 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.560
 and we are glad each other that the 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.900
 advance projects advise us if we 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.100
 we ask and the truth is that the 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.100
 atmosphere that is breathed is very good
