and then praised him for a while and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.549 
and then praised him for a while and
then<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.110> idea<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.440> that<00:00:29.680> you<00:00:30.540> peel<00:00:31.540> what<00:00:32.050> like

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
then the idea is that you peel what like

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.029 
then the idea is that you peel what like
meat<00:00:32.920> is<00:00:33.129> there<00:00:33.760> off<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.329> phone<00:00:35.039> because

a lot of chinese people or no asian

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.240 
a lot of chinese people or no asian
cultures<00:01:07.270> old<00:01:07.540> frying<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.950> we<00:01:09.040> did<00:01:09.190> that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
cultures old frying and so we did that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.450 
cultures old frying and so we did that
and<00:01:09.430> essentially<00:01:10.120> get<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.600> crispy<00:01:11.020> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and essentially get this crispy little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.880 
and essentially get this crispy little
piece<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.610> duck<00:01:12.820> fat<00:01:13.030> that's<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.230> good<00:01:14.380> so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
piece of duck fat that's really good so

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.950 
piece of duck fat that's really good so
we're<00:01:14.980> going<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.160> make<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.490> sandwich<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.330> guess

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
we're going to make the sandwich I guess

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.080 
we're going to make the sandwich I guess
the<00:01:17.190> closest<00:01:18.190> possible<00:01:18.370> thing<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:18.910> can<00:01:19.060> think

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
the closest possible thing I can think

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.390 
the closest possible thing I can think
of<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.540> abandi<00:01:20.050> or<00:01:20.650> something<00:01:20.920> like<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.070> but

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
of is abandi or something like that but

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.780 
of is abandi or something like that but
it's<00:01:21.550> really<00:01:21.820> nothing<00:01:21.970> like

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
it's really nothing like

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's really nothing like
I'm<00:01:23.270> going<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.480> do<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:24.110> duck<00:01:24.530> fat<00:01:24.830> poached<00:01:25.280> egg

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
I'm going to do a duck fat poached egg

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.950 
I'm going to do a duck fat poached egg
so<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.300> place<00:01:29.510> I<00:01:29.660> worked<00:01:29.750> at

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
so this is this is the place I worked at

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.650 
so this is this is the place I worked at
in<00:01:30.080> Spain<00:01:30.410> kind<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.040> started<00:01:31.940> doing<00:01:32.150> these<00:01:32.300> and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
in Spain kind of started doing these and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.720 
in Spain kind of started doing these and
now<00:01:32.900> I<00:01:32.930> think<00:01:33.290> everybody's<00:01:34.160> doing<00:01:34.430> them<00:01:34.550> but<00:01:34.670> I

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
now I think everybody's doing them but I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.730 
now I think everybody's doing them but I
figure<00:01:35.030> since<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.360> worked<00:01:35.540> there<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:35.990> I'm

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
figure since I worked there I I'm

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770 
figure since I worked there I I'm
allowed<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:37.160> keep<00:01:37.280> doing<00:01:37.550> them<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:38.600> take

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
allowed to keep doing them so you take

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.540 
allowed to keep doing them so you take
duck<00:01:39.020> fat<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.440> you<00:01:39.500> spread<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> inside

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
duck fat and you spread it on the inside

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.400 
duck fat and you spread it on the inside
of<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.760> plastic<00:01:40.940> wrap<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.630> put<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.320> egg

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
of the plastic wrap you put the egg

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.500 
of the plastic wrap you put the egg
inside<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.160> it<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:43.400> essentially<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.060> duck<00:01:44.240> fat

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
inside of it so essentially the duck fat

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.200 
inside of it so essentially the duck fat
is<00:01:45.140> what's<00:01:45.500> cooking<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.040> bag<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.229> a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
is what's cooking the bag we have a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.520 
is what's cooking the bag we have a
piece<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:51.460> fermented<00:01:52.460> foie<00:01:52.760> gras<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:54.260> we<00:01:54.350> took

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
piece of fermented foie gras so we took

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.910 
piece of fermented foie gras so we took
flaw<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.220> we<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:56.450> treated<00:01:57.380> at<00:01:57.590> almost

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
flaw and we like treated at almost

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.060 
flaw and we like treated at almost
exactly<00:01:58.160> like<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.759> would<00:01:58.940> like<00:01:59.740> salami<00:02:00.740> or

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.380 

I<00:04:43.720> used<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.900> in<00:04:44.990> Spain<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:46.240> Spanish<00:04:47.240> people

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
I used it in Spain we Spanish people

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.330 
I used it in Spain we Spanish people
like<00:04:47.660> make<00:04:47.870> their<00:04:48.020> horchata<00:04:48.230> with<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.830> all<00:04:49.280> I

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
like make their horchata with it all I

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.700 
like make their horchata with it all I
know<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.300> he's<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.570> Japanese<00:04:51.110> guy<00:04:51.350> and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
know is that he's a Japanese guy and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.680 
know is that he's a Japanese guy and
basically<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.460> best<00:04:53.090> way<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> make<00:04:53.570> this

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
basically the best way to make this

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.080 
basically the best way to make this
thing<00:04:53.900> palatable<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.040> cook<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.610> cream

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
thing palatable is to cook it and cream

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.210 
thing palatable is to cook it and cream
or<00:04:56.360> dairy<00:04:56.600> or<00:04:56.750> something<00:04:57.170> like<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
or dairy or something like that so I

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.930 
or dairy or something like that so I
figured<00:04:58.580> that'd<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.120> rough<00:04:59.330> for<00:04:59.600> him
