00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.540
 we will see the advanced edition of the Middle Ages we will start with them too 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.640
 so fast that allowed to decipher a mesh we can find this tool in 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.139
 the match all the site here 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.240
 for purpose of activating with the letter v not always obvious 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.070
 so once we engage 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 this modification 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.419
 so we have an opening of the marriage 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.949
 to know that for a stop that we move does not correspond to the zone where 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.980
 one's cursor 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 so is to the left of the selection 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.720
 in neighbor move the left stop 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 a name like this for the right 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 but we can also separate a whole selection in what to make a selection 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.760
 short stories 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 there we will press on him 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.450
 unfortunately the selection is separated from the original mesh so we will 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 move with jay z 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.329
 we will do 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.329
 a separation here 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.220
 so he holds it then we move 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.690
 then we can make independent objects just the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.560
 to select 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.210
 so you have to fly over them and then hurry she does not touch her who is going 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.550
 select all mothers who are related 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.390
 then we press tf1 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.970
 to separate them 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.620
 in fact the same thing here it to select all the civil parties 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.390
 and grandpa to separate them 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.180
 now we have three different objects 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.340
 On the other hand 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.030
 alessandro tation 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.190
 they remained the same one has every day the direction of rotation of the object 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.150
 basic 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.539
 to redefine it 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.539
 found from origins origins to geometry 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 we can use a small keyboard is a bit complicated 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 so we can start with a basic scene 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.240
 all have only a common law separated for example an area 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.400
 we will see how to make amalgam 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.760
 so we will separate his tears 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.090
 so here it is assumed that the two men jerome rey review so there is a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 first half which is to use the option 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.419
 after motorcycle balance 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.349
 om which is also available with special operations menu with w9 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.059
 then the motoball is to remove all the parts that are 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.419
 less close who are very close 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.659
 the first operation is to bring this wedding closer together 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.589
 ways to match 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.589
 the artists 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.989
 after we will go into transparency mode 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.759
 to be able to select 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.109
 these two looks over here from his two loops 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.249
 then we would use soft boxing 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.540
 and there we are a little ashamed that a zone of proximity for the artist's 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.519
 so by default 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.989
 there they are not not connected 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.709
 so we'll have to increase 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.749
 this value 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.669
 valiant-prot counting find that 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.669
 the alarms are now merged 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.239
 so now we'll see another method to merge the greens 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.209
 Thissen 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.479
 so we'll clarify again 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.479
 we separated 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.919
 we have then we can do a manual merge so we select each 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.370
 artist a huge must not be bothered because he is behind 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.369
 ok let's get on it we stop b 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.769
 to have only half 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.960
 so we selected vertice and did school m 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.880
 as mayor I 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.519
 that means asserted 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.889
 or otherwise where is in the menu in the matches the ol 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.450
 so we stop at m 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.640
 eventually found merge be the first selection for the last 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.640
 selection at the center or cursor 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.379
 we have to get up at 6 o'clock 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.389
 which are less than 100 km 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.149
 so we can also do this work with what magnetic tools so he 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.899
 must be activated 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.909
 the little clement here 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.359
 so that the master the smap so make it flow robert taxi convert 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.049
 that's how we have to move we must automatically get on 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.239
 the artists 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.139
 what to reactivate especially 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.019
 time but I am 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.770
 croteau sea aegean victims 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.449
 we are accounts of the dishes on the good part his left foot and then 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 that automatically merge 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.259
 as for any merger 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.869
 so so the nice ticket we have the special operations with the letter w 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.749
 see the video ream rer d options we've seen 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.969
 then we will have the merit also another option that allows to make 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 fractal subdivisions 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
 so we select another object 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.090
 and there we engage his divisions with either w9 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.990
 kassimis baÃ¯da 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.499
 so we put the number of subdivisions we want but here we did not 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.300
 a fractal mode 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.629
 so that allows and add distortion 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.629
 on the surface 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.990
 so we have an option this word is also port relationship the vanquished for example 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.699
 and finally we'll see go duplication linked with the talent that 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:34.900
 price 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.259
 like duplicate haiti 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.259
 which allows then but to have disobeyed 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.969
 so that will replicate all the changes 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.259
 according to fernand 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.789
 so it works for mesh and for materials
