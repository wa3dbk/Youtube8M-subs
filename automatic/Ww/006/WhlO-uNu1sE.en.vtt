 lego city comparison and today i will 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.740
 compare two sets 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 here is lego city police first set a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.350
 I will compare the second I ask you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.949
 do you want a comparison in general or not 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.800
 all peace i write yes so this is the first 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.380
 doubt this year here and also if you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 want comparison even more 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.730
 write for example how and what can 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 compare and I will definitely compare here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.320
 so let's we compare them little man 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.789
 wet in the first set only two 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.879
 little man mean police thug here 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.190
 in a new set 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:58.489
 the police have another one look 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.210
 the defendant to and here and now two banyugany 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.240
 even more so here's a chord means here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 this bandyugan looks like this one almost 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.540
 that nothing is different only the face 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.380
 other 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 here and this is an assistant move so his 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.850
 mate they also added a new 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.759
 set three little old two t1 not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 added but in the new set no 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.810
 there is a little fence in the old 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.810
 vodka overboard there are two more brushes and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.009
 small cars like a typewriter 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.909
 such as this is a motorcycle is a quad 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.790
 that means from the box departures ask it 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.729
 the difference is so big because it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.899
 motorcycle it has two wheels quad bikes 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.189
 4 wheels 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.790
 here and about here they are changes in such 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.180
 made the change itself 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 car mean here i could want 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.030
 compare offshore 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 let's consider carry mean before 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.500
 they certainly have tried it here 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.380
 set i don't remember which city ​​i 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.710
 I apologize for something like 10 or 12 and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.560
 equality like 11 years old and this is 14 so you 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.000
 see where is the question of tick and here already 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 in modern times made like an hour 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.300
 but that's headlights almost nothing here not 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.820
 have changed 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.100
 light bulbs the same didn't change anything 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.480
 just different color gratings here 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.360
 black then gray 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.570
 it is simply to increase and also znachechek 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.490
 they place letters here and there is such 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:45.830
 spare parts such rings and I told you 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:49.489
 another fly here and here and here no 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.250
 her cliques cosiness resistor 03 interesting 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.430
 like it and it is written here to raise 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:02.959
 Not written now we compare until 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.019
 jumps immediately that catches the eye 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.660
 naturally everything is different because 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.239
 but I can tell by the height that 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.640
 the first car a little bit longer this is 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.570
 a little more here probably on 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.980
 millimeter 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.100
 Well, how else can you save for example 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 which one for example lower it right away 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.019
 it is visible that 1 above so here so 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.720
 It means that this car has two 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.560
 bulbs in this one not a pack is not a care 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.410
 but for the modern who that night is 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.500
 like paws on the eyes rushes 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.350
 such a topic as the door here 2 is here 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.940
 I certainly do not have to like it when the door 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.820
 I like to open a lot of things 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.130
 opens but we are not just what is here 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.010
 no at the door and does not open where 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.760
 sits down altis tiles everything opens 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.430
 You can take the type I use to do it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.329
 here the door opens 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.329
 further the compartment opens 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.900
 the idea of living the box and all kinds of bells and whistles 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:16.430
 here there are no such apples show what's there 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.000
 here's a little further here design 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.370
 different there is white color here gray 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 farther here such as rivers are you here 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.180
 it's no grille lattice course 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.070
 others here are so gray and a little 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.550
 little seemingly hard to say 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.630
 maybe a little bit more such 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.800
 light gray 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.680
 here and they can be easily broken that is 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.979
 we take it like that we take out and that's it 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.620
 this is a plus what can be looking for 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.780
 mondigo come out through the window and here he is not 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.130
 breaks but it's such a set of herbs 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:02.180
 boot car now lead to the back 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.659
 car parts 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.710
 there are also such blue light bulbs here but 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.500
 there is no way to say this lamp's 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.580
 it means that the doors by 4 certainly differ 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.280
 described here 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.909
 and then you two labels here he 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.070
 such is the door 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:27.260
 means to open and of course there are hours 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.220
 opens here so here you can 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.560
 here pass from there gangster and here she 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.830
 it opens just like this 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.669
 go here gangster and I will show 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.530
 you like the top here as if nothing 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.349
 such of all naturally methane 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.270
 basically do not like this car like 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.870
 the back opens took place here tonsure 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.169
 I have worse cheers here so search 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.349
 opens the door b2 opens the door 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:02.150
 cell fleece and now let's go to 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:05.360
 above means here above here and so here 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.120
 what the difference is not very big but 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.880
 here it opens as if to say so 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.570
 Luke 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.500
 so we open and see what's in 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.500
 this typewriter 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.010
 Here is such a topic so you can put in 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.550
 indigo on 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:25.440
 or here or types here for example 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:30.120
 Cyprus shooters 1st and then opens 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.400
 the door and start it pick up the roshka here 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.260
 the door opens right now click.ru here and 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.760
 you want to draw something or 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.180
 let's say as in pictures 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.320
 steal this key and run off vodka 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.850
 I can say the avenue opens for now 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.000
 and further 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:58.650
 handle this body later opens further 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.430
 door behind the driver of the tour in the first 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.970
 set 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.570
 and up above opens in a new set so

 that and still in the middle of a man so i dont 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.670
