know<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> dynamic<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> match<00:00:19.590> was<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
know the dynamic of the match was a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950 
know the dynamic of the match was a
little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.279> weird<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> felt<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
little bit weird for me I felt like I

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.390 
little bit weird for me I felt like I
didn't<00:00:22.199> take<00:00:22.350> my<00:00:22.380> opportunities<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
didn't take my opportunities in the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
didn't take my opportunities in the
first<00:00:23.640> step<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.529> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.740> waste<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
first step which was kind of a waste and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000 
first step which was kind of a waste and
it<00:00:26.699> gave<00:00:26.880> her<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.109> confidence

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it gave her I think a lot of confidence

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
it gave her I think a lot of confidence
and<00:00:29.279> she<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.670> came<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> great

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and she really came up with the great

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
and she really came up with the great
shots<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.470> she<00:00:31.619> needed<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
shots you know when she needed with a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
shots you know when she needed with a
big<00:00:32.399> surf<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.690> never<00:00:34.020> seen<00:00:34.380> her

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
big surf which I actually never seen her

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
big surf which I actually never seen her
serve<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.130> before<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.880> there's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
serve like that before so there's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
serve like that before so there's
definitely<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.690> big<00:00:36.899> improvement<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.620> her

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
definitely a big improvement from her

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.930

felt much better you know third side and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600 
felt much better you know third side and
in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> first<00:00:50.730> set<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:52.610> going

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
in the first set which is you know going

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
in the first set which is you know going
you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:55.219> path<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.789> mark<00:00:57.239> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you know our path to to our mark it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.710 
you know our path to to our mark it's
pretty<00:00:58.260> good<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.800> happy<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.160> that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.760 

I<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.090> closed<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.630> biggest<00:01:17.020> gap<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.500> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
I think I closed the biggest gap in that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.150 
I think I closed the biggest gap in that
in<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.130> in<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.120> area<00:01:19.540> for<00:01:20.020> sure<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.470> think

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
in that in that area for sure I think

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.930 
in that in that area for sure I think
you<00:01:21.430> know<00:01:21.550> overall<00:01:22.590> my<00:01:23.590> physical<00:01:24.190> ability<00:01:24.730> my

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.320 
you know overall my physical ability my
tennis<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.540> improved<00:01:26.020> as<00:01:26.470> well<00:01:26.530> but<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:28.060> gap

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
tennis is improved as well but the gap

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.540 
tennis is improved as well but the gap
between<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:29.260> know<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.560> mental<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.190> tennis

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
between you know the mental and tennis

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.490 
between you know the mental and tennis
and<00:01:30.670> physical<00:01:31.180> was<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.660> biggest<00:01:31.960> improvement

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500

was a most ridiculous thing there is it

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.400 
was a most ridiculous thing there is it
after<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:12.820> already<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.330> know<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> walked<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.260> my

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.449 
because she already gave that you know
points<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.380> was<00:02:23.500> ridiculous<00:02:24.040> goal<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
the ball was way before the line it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:37.930 
the ball was way before the line it
wasn't<00:02:26.320> even<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.769> line

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.390 

no<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.420> get<00:02:39.570> over<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:41.010> mean

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
no I have to get over it I just I mean

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.070 
no I have to get over it I just I mean
everybody<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.180> make<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.390> mistake<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.050> just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
everybody can make a mistake I just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.650 
everybody can make a mistake I just
think<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.700> heat<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.240> moment

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
think you know in that heat of a moment

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.900 
think you know in that heat of a moment
like<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.830> will<00:02:46.950> take<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.520> little<00:02:47.730> bit

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
like that you will take it a little bit

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.030 
like that you will take it a little bit
more<00:02:48.090> emotional<00:02:48.690> than<00:02:48.900> maybe<00:02:49.320> there<00:02:49.860> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
more emotional than maybe there is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.230 
more emotional than maybe there is
because<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.870> know<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.050> situation<00:02:52.830> you're

probably not so there was there was a
very<00:04:11.790> tough<00:04:12.030> decision<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:12.570> me<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.690> take<00:04:13.050> that

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
very tough decision for me to take that

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
I knew that if I don't take that

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.289 
I knew that if I don't take that
decision<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.959> know<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.290> will<00:04:19.440> jeopardize<00:04:20.299> my

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
decision you know it will jeopardize my

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.510
