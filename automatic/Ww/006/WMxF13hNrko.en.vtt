adding<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.639> where<00:04:44.849> you<00:04:45.000> can<00:04:45.210> expand<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.289> new

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
adding to where you can expand in new

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.059 
adding to where you can expand in new
more<00:04:47.310> things<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.000> higher<00:04:48.270> prices<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.259> food<00:04:49.919> in

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
more things and higher prices on food in

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.990 
more things and higher prices on food in
the<00:04:50.190> arena<00:04:50.930> when<00:04:51.930> you're<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.259> gym<00:04:52.729> which<00:04:53.729> I

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
the arena when you're the gym which I

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.980 
the arena when you're the gym which I
probably<00:04:54.810> will<00:04:55.259> not<00:04:55.440> do<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.099> man<00:04:57.000> this

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
probably will not do because man this

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.930 
probably will not do because man this
arena<00:04:58.320> food<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.680> already<00:04:59.070> expensive<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.880> i

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
arena food is already expensive and i

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.439 
arena food is already expensive and i
don't<00:05:00.479> like<00:05:00.539> panther<00:05:01.050> prices<00:05:01.470> now<00:05:01.770> as<00:05:01.949> a<00:05:01.979> fan

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.899 
like maybe la the Knicks not so much
Miami<00:05:31.860> because<00:05:32.039> they<00:05:32.130> have<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.310> big<00:05:32.639> three

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909
