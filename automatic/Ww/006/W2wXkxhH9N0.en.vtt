00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
surroundings and everything i would

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.690 
surroundings and everything i would
definitely<00:04:56.490> recommend<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:58.250> automatic<00:04:59.250> assault

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
definitely recommend a automatic assault

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.550

rifle<00:05:00.180> or<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.480> submachine<00:05:01.470> gun<00:05:03.380> going<00:05:04.380> for

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
rifle or a submachine gun going for

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.240 
rifle or a submachine gun going for
clips<00:05:04.800> anything<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:07.710> would<00:05:07.890> probably<00:05:08.070> be

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
clips anything this would probably be

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.160 
clips anything this would probably be
good<00:05:08.340> map<00:05:08.670> part<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.180> toilet<00:05:09.420> tight<00:05:09.840> spaces

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
good map part to the toilet tight spaces

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.810 
good map part to the toilet tight spaces
