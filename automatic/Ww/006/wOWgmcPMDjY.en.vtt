00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.570
 experienced gardeners know that after cleaning 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.940
 harvest work in the garden does not end 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.190
 For example, in autumn they plant winter garlic for 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.410
 so that the root system has time 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.510
 emerge Nikolai Andreevich 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.540
 claims that he drank the Ural quarrel 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.210
 garlic it grows in any weather gives 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.630
 good harvest kept perfectly all 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.330
 winter 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.329
 with garlic growing every year 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.160
 large gardener resorted 1 tricks on 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.489
 this garlic 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.089
 an arrow appears but on this arrow 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.719
 there is a check mark and there on this 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.269
 tadpoles are a bunch of these bulbs 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.870
 kidneys and select large bulbs on 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.499
 landing 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.249
 here they grow it from these bombs here 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.809
 such 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.559
 one tube 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.920
 soot 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.610
 these 1 little teeth and in the third year we get 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.380
 Here is a head of garlic and I 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.130
 clean every year 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.020
 larger 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.810
 Today we came to Nikolai Andreevich 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.520
 while he seems to loosen the soil 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.219
 planting Ural garlic 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.409
 when the soil is ready soon we need 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.719
 make a furrow to a depth of 20 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.450
 centimeters in her bowls land 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.659
 distance between them is 15-20 centimeters 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.460
 then it falls asleep and after 20 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.399
 centimeters nikolay andreevich 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.649
 already making the second furrow like this 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:39.619
 passed around in assholes pieces 20 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.840
 adapters heads the garlic heads in 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.580
 principle on fury enough because 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 each head with 120 grams is 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.560
 enough who have any appetite 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.240
 By the way, some Andreevich advises 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.790
 mark furrows with pegs 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.320
 so that in the spring you can easily identify 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.390
 where are the bulbs planted 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.450
 and where on the teeth is 1 pack here I 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.119
 I also plant shallow depths here too 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.740
 and overgrown 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:17.960
 and doing another barons now I will erase 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:22.870
 here is a big one on seeds 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:26.930
 I breed this barrel 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.520
 it is necessary to get a seed bedside table here 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.800
 where you must leave 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.810
 the arrow with arrows is very convenient 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.850
 determine the time of harvest 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 if the head with bulba barrels became dry 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.620
 and cracked the garlic can on digging 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.440
 important something from the timeliness of cleaning 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.010
 depends on its safety and now judging by 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.740
 projected 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.390
 it's time to plant garlic in fact do 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.320
 it should be two to three weeks before 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.320
 cold snap
