00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:10.530
 this probably should not be 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 I say rather much rather than not done 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.410
 there is not a lot I say but in short 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 pretty obvious that you see better 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.080
 the video of themes of self I changed the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 camcorder because now that either 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 battery problems began 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.949
 so he stopped during 13 half-angels 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.199
 in short, I had exploited it very much 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 all the videos I have were part of it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 made hundreds of videos then we bring it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 even outside therefore a holy man who does 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 school this great gift is made 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.579
 he told me about it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 our anniversary for my 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 birthday for christmas the verdict 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 today I decided to promote the buoy 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 promoted and rejected as well as yes 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 will understand from the title but I liked it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 failed in the first place 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.160
 as I will call it anyway because I was a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.870
 revenge the television before there was the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 piccarello peel which as he says 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.640
 issima that I know but you don't 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 well known which you must know 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.159
 91 91 is the increase of a single one 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 box or then somewhere but it is anyway 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 as he said in a bio in other words that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.790
 establishes of peter hayes arrived 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.430
 smashed the so-called mine then 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 heard that sarah and having to do the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.390
 video of promoted failed instead 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.409
 got the bad bowl I can't 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.650
 next period even months I am 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 have been sent things two little things are 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 of phyto and is seen by gea drugs though 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.900
 along with the goblet stuff but it has 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 put different feelings into things however 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
 things of what you can try them now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 because I've never mixed water yes 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
 must immediately melt these instead 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.189
 two which are a fluid and therefore for 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 hair and a hair oil are 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 they had to be tested a little more too 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 because I have to expect to wash my hair 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 then it is not that I see it only of one 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.680
 time I have to do washes I have to do i 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.980
 I always try this way instead 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 done 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.280
 lacoste cost written with k is that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 I am a low-cost make-up brand 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.300
 sure many of the war have also seen 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.280
 in small perfumeries or even at 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.070
 supermarket also in other small ones 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.050
 shops is an Italian brand that makes 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.480
 precisely make up and low cost 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.730
 we begin to fail or begin to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.250
 promote I reject the first thing 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.280
 I'm going to fail and this mascara here 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.740
 is a revenue mascara that resists hydra 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 the resistance waterproof mascara 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.820
 and it is precisely this here that should 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 be all waterproof mascara 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.650
 so cool for summer because col 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.260
 sweat water should not melt me 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.900
 I wore it both normal 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 obviously in the morning and in the evening you 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 like to win easy in the sense that not 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 you sweat a lot in the rosy morning morning 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 it's another time I used it to go 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
 at the sea sister sarah and that is on the face the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.380
 moment nothing do not touch me at the sea 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.030
 personally also because the boys if 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.640
 then he exposes the agents to me from the sun 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.010
 penetrating make-up chemicals do not 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.930
 ago however they have this just mascara 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.240
 to find it and to take a closer look 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 woke up your sweeney was not 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.310
 He had to strain now is not that I 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.410
 I wanted to throw myself back into the water 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
 on having nothing even if I found it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.670
 but mascara like that was enough 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 that the professor but what a sketch of water 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.620
 etc. etc. not a month or so 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.840
 not even with the water there is a past never 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.910
 get to the beach in short, I'm from 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.780
 how much of arms that the mascara under 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.880
 so it's not in my case a toilet 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.100
 maybe someone else not approved 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.470
 in short, less will confirm or not 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.940
 I know maybe a subjective thing 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.940
 I absolutely can't not have done one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.220
 statistic success people on me me 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.709
 a foundation and powder was sent 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 in the sense that a liquid foundation that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.239
 but then when it dries from that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.580
 fantastic powdery effect I have it 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.510
 tried at home because but right for 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.250
 tell you about the product 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.690
 I couldn't try it out for the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.840
 simple reason they sent me 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.989
 this color that is apart from that the 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.370
 packaging is very uncomfortable because you see 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.019
 in the tube just do a little well 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.540
 listed as it comes out now I have to 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.790
 absolutely close it importable not 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.000
 I could really approve it outside that is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.000
 a really too dark spot and it's not 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.980
 bad there is in the sense that I can't 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.200
 define ie I would not use in the summer 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.260
 because anyway even if in the end a 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.480
 chypre effect and heavy and feels 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.340
 on the skin, however, a compromised sky 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.940
 this is a polish of the collection 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.770
 precisely their cost and is a ditch 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.720
 beautiful because a bright red but with 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.390
 let's see if I can get it 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.760
 perceive orange in color 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.860
 which I really like is that I had it 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.780
 in the last video they had shown 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.850
 relieved because anyway after four 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.590
 days and girls for me are many 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.360
 because I am always with my hands a 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.870
 let the water run in the stream 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.510
 grateful I put the spain back so it is one man 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.450
 I am always a second fair a 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.190
 part the color then you liked it is 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.930
 very full on the first pass, that is me 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.090
 I didn't do two passes if as you see 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.830
 the last video arrival on the enamel is 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.120
 but that holds the common piero ie 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.650
 I didn't do the second one in the photo one 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.020
 passed and we make his instrument with 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.880
 in short, transparent is also enough 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.080
 low cost so now we have gone 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.510
 promoted that we completely change it 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.830
 short I finally talk to you because it comes 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.410
 I really wanted to talk too though 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.810
 I have been waiting for these rent products 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.760
 dense really is a brand that suits me 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.500
 supporting each time more edifice 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.910
 where I bought 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.430
 the rental name for the hair I use 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.230
 yet it is still between the board and the site 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.420
 gloss that served when still living with 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.790
 but all the hair is cassani 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.590
 without strikes barra noir the reflections of the 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.420
 sure that the announces the grandfather some 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.040
 dark lights but in the sunlight when 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.930
 new hair showed reflexes 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.510
 of color possession put me under the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.010
 lens of colored but cucciari when 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.720
 I have been the ones sent by drugs 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.760
 he already has everything to try these 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.590
 my estimates are two 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.090
 grown if so seconds sportingly 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.330
 estimate for a hair oil 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.220
 the first is a fluid a fluid milk 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.400
 moisturizer for hair and not yes 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.410
 risciacqua ie using as 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.810
 product after shop where to have washed 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.030
 hair with shampoo and also wanting 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.620
 spring but no mask can become 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.970
 a little too much has associated us with the 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.120
 mask can get a little too much 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.640
 as heavy as airc and routine and 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.230
 let's say before you have to dry the 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.450
 hair that you do a crease or what 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.910
 leave natural when applied in drops 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.590
 of this fluid on the lengths and then e 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.280
 continue with the fold then without 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.470
 rinse 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.120
 the auction will be able to leave much more 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.670
 quickly because the hair is really 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.740
 really soft if you release them naturally 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.240
 feel hydrated we also add the 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.680
 made that also together with the eye that 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.840
 I'll show you later are products 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.810
 completely natural we do biblo 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.040
 so super promoted I leave you the 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.920
 link if this is oil 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.150
 in the info box that then precisely 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.570
 dealer who amy high to drugs 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.190
 Niger 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.770
 so you are safely on 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.410
 niger drugs the other one is oil ed 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.110
 is a completely vegetable oil for 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.390
 dry rebel hair ends this too 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.100
 it should not be rinsed, it is rather light 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.890
 like oil in the sense that compared to 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.260
 other types of oil is not very heavy 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.580
 however it is always moono despite having 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.770
 very dry hair once I have 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.990
 wrong though to prove it wrong I have 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.000
 put to this yes put the fluid 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.580
 after washing admitted that a little bit 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.500
 of this oil and the hair itself 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.980
 very dirty, of course 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.690
 because I take care bye where very high 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.280
 that is, IQ that out 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.830
 from the normal and therefore it is better to dose or 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.900
 like pre shampoo or whenever you want 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.820
 we even impose fake sea ​​on the sea 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.100
 take a bath rinse your hair underneath 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.080
 the shower those at the sea point take off 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.900
 the salt to use the oil that i 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.670
 benches others and to protect here from the sun 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.430
 from the salt in the sand use them in 

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.080

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.200
 really soft and juve of the lambs 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.030
 buckets of nature now also bought 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.160

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.240

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.910

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:07.740
