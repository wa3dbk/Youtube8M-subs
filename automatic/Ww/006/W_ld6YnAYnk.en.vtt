00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.940 

now<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.460> kept<00:00:02.820> our<00:00:03.000> rules<00:00:03.270> over<00:00:03.480> here<00:00:03.929> for<00:00:04.680> how

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
now I kept our rules over here for how

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.610 
now I kept our rules over here for how
we<00:00:05.009> multiply<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.759> two-digit<00:00:06.480> number<00:00:06.509> times<00:00:07.470> a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
we multiply a two-digit number times a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.280 
we multiply a two-digit number times a
two-digit<00:00:08.220> number

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
two-digit number

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
two-digit number
this<00:00:10.290> one<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> little<00:00:11.099> harder<00:00:11.219> because<00:00:11.790> when

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
this one is a little harder because when

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.700 
this one is a little harder because when
we<00:00:12.330> multiply<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.840> numbers<00:00:13.230> some<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.530> them<00:00:13.650> are

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
we multiply the numbers some of them are

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.840 
we multiply the numbers some of them are
going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:13.980> more<00:00:14.219> than<00:00:14.400> ten<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.650> first<00:00:17.550> step

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
going to be more than ten so first step

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.090 
going to be more than ten so first step
is<00:00:18.150> multiply<00:00:18.810> by<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.109> ones<00:00:19.439> place

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
is multiply by the ones place

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.160 
is multiply by the ones place
and<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.510> my

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and I'm going to do that right here my

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.210 
and I'm going to do that right here my
ones<00:00:22.500> place<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.449> right<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.660> 4<00:00:25.140> times<00:00:25.560> 6<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
ones place is right here so 4 times 6 is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.299 
ones place is right here so 4 times 6 is
24<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> 4<00:00:28.050> down<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:29.849> 2<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.330> here

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
24 put my 4 down here and my 2 up here

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.500 
24 put my 4 down here and my 2 up here
then<00:00:32.309> might<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.820> set<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.120> broken

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
then might like my set my broken

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.930 
then might like my set my broken
windshield<00:00:34.020> wiper<00:00:34.230> moves<00:00:34.680> its<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.190> across<00:00:35.399> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
windshield wiper moves its way across it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.619 
windshield wiper moves its way across it
only<00:00:36.090> goes<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.750> way<00:00:37.730> 4<00:00:38.730> times<00:00:39.239> 7<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> 28<00:00:41.600> but<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
only goes this way 4 times 7 is 28 but I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
only goes this way 4 times 7 is 28 but I
have<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> 2<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.350> here<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.760> raise<00:00:44.940> their<00:00:45.120> hand

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have a 2 up here we can raise their hand

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.840 
have a 2 up here we can raise their hand
tell<00:00:45.629> me<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> what

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
tell me what I do with that to and what

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.459 
tell me what I do with that to and what
the<00:00:48.000> answer<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:50.570> add<00:00:51.570> 2<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> 28

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the answer is going to be I add 2 to 28

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.529 
the answer is going to be I add 2 to 28
so<00:00:52.590> what's<00:00:52.739> manse<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.719> 30

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
so what's manse are going to be 30

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.010 
so what's manse are going to be 30
because<00:00:57.539> 4<00:00:57.899> times<00:00:58.230> 7<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> 28<00:00:59.160> plus<00:00:59.309> 2<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> 30<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
because 4 times 7 is 28 plus 2 is 30 so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
because 4 times 7 is 28 plus 2 is 30 so
there<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.530> done<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.100> step<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.930> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there I'm done with step one now I'm in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
there I'm done with step one now I'm in
step<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.570> zero<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:08.210> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
step two I need to put a zero and to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
step two I need to put a zero and to
hold<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> ones<00:01:09.930> place<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
hold the ones place because I'm going to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.730 
hold the ones place because I'm going to
be<00:01:10.979> multiplying<00:01:11.159> by<00:01:11.670> tens<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> zero

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
be multiplying by tens I put a zero

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.270 
be multiplying by tens I put a zero
right<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.659> now<00:01:15.740> here's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> point<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> want

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
right here now here's the point I want

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.670 
right here now here's the point I want
you<00:01:17.640> guys<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> watch<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> be

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you guys to watch I'm going to be

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.880 
you guys to watch I'm going to be
multiplying<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> tens<00:01:20.850> place<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
multiplying by the tens place now I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
multiplying by the tens place now I
don't<00:01:22.890> need<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.640> number<00:01:24.150> anymore<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.990> going

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
don't need this number anymore I'm going

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.460 
don't need this number anymore I'm going
to<00:01:25.799> cross<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.780> don't<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> getting

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to cross it out I don't want it getting

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
to cross it out I don't want it getting
in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.909> our<00:01:30.060> other<00:01:30.240> numbers

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
in the way of other of our other numbers

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
in the way of other of our other numbers
I'm<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> put<00:01:32.009> an<00:01:32.100> X<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.759> not

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
I'm just going to put an X to it not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
I'm just going to put an X to it not
erase<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
erase it because we have to go back and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.890 
erase it because we have to go back and
fix<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:35.970> us<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
fix it I want us to know there was it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.319 
fix it I want us to know there was it
two<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:38.310> we're<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
two there but we're not going to use it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.130 
two there but we're not going to use it
anymore<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.470> crossing<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:43.110> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
anymore so I'm crossing it out now I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.480 
anymore so I'm crossing it out now I
have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.770> multiply<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.810> two<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:46.530> groups<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.189> 10

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
have to multiply by two two groups of 10

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270 
have to multiply by two two groups of 10
and<00:01:47.790> since<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.750> multiplying<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.409> tens<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and since I'm multiplying by tens my I'm

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.499 
and since I'm multiplying by tens my I'm
going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> start<00:01:50.729> writing<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.060> answer

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
going to start writing my answer

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.920 
going to start writing my answer
underneath<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> tens<00:01:52.649> place<00:01:53.030> two<00:01:54.030> times<00:01:54.509> six

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
underneath the tens place two times six

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.100 
underneath the tens place two times six
is<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:56.250> what's<00:01:57.180> two<00:01:57.360> times<00:01:57.390> six

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
is what what's two times six

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
is what what's two times six
so<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> two<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so I'm going to put a two down here and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.249 
so I'm going to put a two down here and
my<00:02:01.530> 1<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> come<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.020> see<00:02:04.020> I'm

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
my 1 is going to come up here see I'm

Semyon<00:02:44.450> add<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.860> up<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.250> I'm<00:02:46.340> putting<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.640> plus

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
Semyon add it up so I'm putting a plus

Semyon add it up so I'm putting a plus
sign<00:02:47.210> I'm<00:02:47.570> putting<00:02:48.380> an<00:02:48.470> equal<00:02:48.890> sign<00:02:49.540> 4<00:02:50.540> plus<00:02:51.050> 0

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
sign I'm putting an equal sign 4 plus 0

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.440 
sign I'm putting an equal sign 4 plus 0
is<00:02:51.890> 4<00:02:52.310> 0<00:02:53.590> plus<00:02:54.590> 2<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.190> 2<00:02:55.310> men<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.000> make<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.270> easy

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
is 4 0 plus 2 is 2 men that make it easy

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.650 
is 4 0 plus 2 is 2 men that make it easy
for<00:02:56.570> us<00:02:57.340> three<00:02:58.340> plus<00:02:58.850> five<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.690> eight<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.660> one

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
for us three plus five is eight and one

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.180 
for us three plus five is eight and one
plus<00:03:03.170> well<00:03:03.470> nothing<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.430> one<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:06.410> when<00:03:06.860> we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
plus well nothing is just one so when we

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.290 
plus well nothing is just one so when we
take<00:03:07.960> 76<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:09.170> multiply<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.680> by<00:03:09.740> 24<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.550> we

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
take 76 and multiply it by 24 and we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.030 
take 76 and multiply it by 24 and we
follow<00:03:11.630> our<00:03:11.780> 4<00:03:12.290> steps

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
follow our 4 steps

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.770 
follow our 4 steps
the<00:03:13.640> answer<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:16.810> 1824<00:03:17.810> okay
