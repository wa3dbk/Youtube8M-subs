thing in the store right now I have no

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.539 
thing in the store right now I have no
idea<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> sounds<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.490> even

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
idea what it sounds like and don't even

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.240 
idea what it sounds like and don't even
care<00:01:51.110> there<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.349> of<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.039> choose

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
care there are a lot of things to choose

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
care there are a lot of things to choose
from<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.789> kind<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> tough<00:01:54.179> but<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.599> now

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
from so it's kind of tough but right now

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.130 
from so it's kind of tough but right now
I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.319> sound<00:01:55.590> city<00:01:55.829> Concord<00:01:56.459> am

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
I think it's the sound city Concord am

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
I think it's the sound city Concord am
mostly<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.349> it<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.799> has<00:01:59.569> on<00:02:00.569> all<00:02:00.869> these

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
mostly because it just has on all these

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.059 
mostly because it just has on all these
weird<00:02:02.959> switches<00:02:03.959> and<00:02:04.140> graphics<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
weird switches and graphics and
