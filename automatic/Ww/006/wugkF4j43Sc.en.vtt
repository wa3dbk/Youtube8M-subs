00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 Y 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:34.590
 I am the euros I was born in Buenos Aires 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 / for many years in the province and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.290
 then I moved to the capital and studied in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 music conservatories classical music 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 lyrical music and then I went to a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 little more to primitive music more 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.840
 African woman from India and there I started as a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.480
 find a little my style my music and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.480
 my voice this and from there came the black 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.940
 I do not lie 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.930
 wind 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 and meaningless 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.520
 in san fernando 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 these straws 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:27.280
 it's like a dream that I never imagined that 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.800
 this was going to happen 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.050
 I am very happy it makes me very happy to live 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
 this unexpected moment so nothing 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.010
 I am very grateful I am very happy 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.870
 along with the band we're also 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.480
 enjoying this special moment 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.240
 because good we feel like very 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.310
 loved by the people here and well 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.420
 received so nothing makes us want to 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.420
 be here all the time 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 you 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.890
 good socially the cumbia in argentina 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.400
 represents several things there are musicians that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.709
 like rap do it in usa the way 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.530
 of protest also the in Argentina 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.140
 many musicians use cumbia to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.060
 manifest I do not know 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 to criticize the government or the police 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.400
 this and good and there are also other musicians 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.170
 of my case that we make music more cumbia 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.989
 that has more to do with today with the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.940
 love or telling stories, what do I know about 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.769
 life situations that happen so 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 How good I think in Argentina and how 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.209
 different types of cumbia but the most 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 specific are these 2 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.490
 there is an injury that cries a pity that 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.920
 supreme good and by anybody but 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.240
 in the jungle when they temper the one they are 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.240
 brunettes moves the hip 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.460
 on wood 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.599
 I 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.599
 almost everything in a way 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.830
 to improve 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 but there is a singer that we discovered 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.680
 Now recently that is that 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.020
 It is also French and I like it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.970
 much his music his videos and we are about 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.520
 fans of him and now I had the pleasure 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.950
 to meet him and participate together in a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.319
 song with a song from him so 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.800
 I would not recommend anything because I love it 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.800
 his music 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.420
 of loneliness and with the night they feel 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.830
 loneliness when they laugh you feel loneliness 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.830
 because meanwhile in solitude 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.390
 I did not know him but now I knew him before 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.670
 to touch that we discover what is 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.550
 it treated and we were as surprised not 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.840
 we thought it was so big and the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.640
 truth is that nothing we were very 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.250
 eager for the moment to come 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.050
 because it seems like a super festival 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.090
 important and we also love it to be 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.220
 free and that people can come to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.530
 see us and it's a matter as well as of me 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.670
 love the demonstrations that the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.260
 people join in a square to be able 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.620
 enjoy the music so I 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.620
 love 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.820
 the time
