 You're a bread that's more we use in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.619
 pc that the beauty that in fact is the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 right browser died before I ever used 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 It's all from the internet. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 also explore until 11 really is not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.590
 It's bad, but a browser that I 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 I really liked it, it's the browser 's bai 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.780
 this program then some all 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 very coarse reduction programs that neither 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 think about party other programs is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.860
 I really do not advise you to use it. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.500
 it 's antivirus by what advice you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 the chrome has some additional a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 more to itown I think if you put 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.519

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.790
 stay the same but this browser really 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.520
 I was surprised by the speed of 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 navigation and performance 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.740

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.169
 use the hardware generation mode if it is 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.970
 available then here you activating here 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.639
 Baidu is automatically using the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.669
 your gpu to help process the 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.310
 graphics page or that there 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.799

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.639
 So much so that I had another rank stayed 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.540

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.379
 the update you come here, this is it 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.750
 for any browser the crowd to the 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.819
 chrome one thing about chrome or about 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.760
 This particular did not mean here just 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.469

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.109
 latest version that you are installing and 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.680

 The guys are there, the tip is a 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.199
 Basic tip about the browser is not 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.849
 I advise you to install other programs 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.669
 of the bay of the ego only managed to settle 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.070
 the browser that really is good others 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.210
 programs are no longer effective. 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.300
 medium 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:13.099
 let's say it's kind of do not have a 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 so perfect running out 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.780
 leaving the pc slow instead of leaving 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.199
 fast is not and pc party in the stadium 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.880
 antivirus antivirus're going for those 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.010
 has doubt that it is a good antivirus 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.870
 antivirus I use a lot there face and 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.080
 I advise you are using 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.900
 is it to see Avira is one of the antivirus 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.139
 there leave off he left weakened 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 he was doing something there then 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.250
 I left weak but then an antivirus 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.260
 very good that I use a lot of time and 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.560
 really advice you're using is the 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.210
 avira face after listening to avast 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.789

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.820
 Full is less headache - little 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.800
 on the screen showing then is less false 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.260
 positive I think there was really inside 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.080
 of the tests has shown up to date a great 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.919
 antivirus tape ' so I advise a lot 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.259

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.530
 London starts giving is bottleneck of 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:51.500
 to charge a phase such an exit sometimes is 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.569
 a machine with 160 power supply or 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.460
 the files of the machine then all 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:58.159
 spread and thereby making the machine 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.949
 sometimes take you even to boot 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:03.169

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:20.240
 Time, I do not have anything to say either. 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.889
