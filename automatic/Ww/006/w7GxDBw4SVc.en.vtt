00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.230
 that is a real hot cargo the coking plant Prosper sends Werner with 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.340
 the truck it is a pilot project in which the waste heat from coal mining 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.380
 kungeln a container is routed and in turn is with a truck too 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.060
 a school is driving to heat the building there is still the whole 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 As I said a try it could be an innovative in the near future 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.759
 Schwaben documents 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.289
 Coking plant Prosper 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.410
 more than 1000 degrees hot is the coolest any press will be an almost unimaginable 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.510
 Heat develops around Aigner sees 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
 some of it just disappears so unused 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690
 but that could change soon 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.530
 if the waste heat from the coking plant is supposed to heat a school and that with one 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.470
 Container 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.050
 who can store heat like a battery 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 the container is filled with pyrite salt 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.550
 then only the heat needs to be supplied from the coking plant, for example 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 become 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.130
 This will be the festival of the will for itself 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.220
 when the container is fully loaded when we are the container to the heat we are 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.510
 go here in the case the school 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.000
 and then move back with one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.830
 Heat exchangers heat and feed them in that's called and sets 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.910
 in the Bottroper pilot project, the excess heat is in the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.590
 Coking plant promise is used and thus to fill the containers 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 from there they drive to less than a kilometer away Hebel elementary school 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730
 Here the container is connected to the heating system 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.140
 the water from school back then flows the heat exchanger in 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.110
 Container 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.160
 Now in October, who will estimate the container will stand in for three days 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.170
 Winter we estimate that he is there 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.810
 with one day already heard that explains and forest at the Bucher 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.970
 has to be recharged 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.510
 as part of the bid for the city competition Kinowelt Chen City Run 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.600
 in Bottrop several such energy-saving projects 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.940
 For the city, the mobile heat storage are just a building block on the 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.939
 Off to a more climate-friendly city 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.490
 if you think out there in 2020 and think until 2050 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.869
 and then want to become a climate-neutral city at the time 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.429
 This kind of small-scale project will have to become a nationwide institution 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.510
 so that as much as possible co2 is saved at all points 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.849
 Containers as moving heaters that is just an attempt for the time being 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.379
 the project pays off in many within the next few years 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.749
 in the Ruhr area want the containers 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.120
 The Ruhr area is a good region for us Waha metropolitan area will be short 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.089
 Paths between 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.389
 Werner lower and heat sources 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.359
 and when you network half as many porta in this way 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.029
 How much energy and therefore money can be saved exactly must 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.809
 show the project first yet 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:43.709
 understood 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.730
 Hundreds of tons of co2 that are still going to blow up then will not work anymore 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.260
 consumed
