00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.820
 yourself 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 and more 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.780
 Laughter 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 and we are ready to do the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 makeup of clawdeen wolf 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 so cleaning the face so that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.690
 can facilitate our work to have it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.350
 clean and fresh is very important let's go 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.000
 to apply now the concealer and always 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 we mentioned that for a characterization 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.610
 it is important to apply it not only in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.259
 the lower eyelid but also in the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 superior to be able to have a canvas 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.180
 clean and the colors that we can apply 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.830
 be clearer now also when 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 we are doing a makeup in this 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.520
 case of characterization given to the type of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.189
 character that is of a human animal 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.799
 an animal human in this case then 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.990
 we also need to highlight the temples 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.610
 no model has the cheekbones 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.850
 pronounced that will allow us 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.270
 also work that and highlight in the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 traits we want to apply the base if 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.569
 you may notice it is a bit darker 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.369
 than normal and will also help 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.069
 highlight the light color we have 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.590
 used in the concealer around 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.459
 the eyelids the application of this same 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.780
 base 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.410
 I want you to observe how it is going 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.200
 surrounding the cheekbone not simulating a 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.400
 sinking allowing the cheekbone to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 highlight and already have a factional one 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.500
 little more animal not now I'm not 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.569
 touching a lot of the jaw 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.010
 chin 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.560
 in this case the jaw because really 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.780
 you do not need it now we seal with powders 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.319
 loose all around that has been 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.180
 corrected with light color and also what 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.579
 we do with all the dark tone that 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.859
 we have used that will allow 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.310
 all this uniform there if we include everything 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.560
 the face the neck and we proceed to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.209
 apply the shadows look how sharp 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.299
 is the color that we choose very 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.459
 important for this the type of shadow 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.840
 that we choose, I mean in terms of 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 quality 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.700
 because the pigment you have is going to 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.220
 allow the sharpness of the color that we are going 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.770
 to apply now 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.680
 you can use many tricks to 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.500
 be able to reach a desired tone 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.660
 the combination would be one of them a 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.560
 pencil background possibly in this case 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.840
 look for the combination of some 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.710
 tones and a half this color is not a color 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.600
 specific that allows you to see something 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 different inside the makeup and you 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.760
 they will observe it when it is finished 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.670
 now I want you to observe has retired 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.660
 a little the dust that can fall from 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.920
 the shadows 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.319
 now we move on to the other eye 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.730
 this is important that they can do 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.950
 if you do not have much experience in the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.770
 makeup and it's what we try to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.470
 apply when showing this tutorial to 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.260
 that they have the possibility to observe 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.010
 both eyes at once and see that they are 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.030
 absolutely even 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.310
 never bend 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.880
 that can give you the makeup you have to 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.730
 be exactly the same as the other eye 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.450
 and that will allow you to 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.330
 Makeup really looks 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.200
 done as if it were done by a 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.050
 professional 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 we are now applying the light color 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.050
 is a tone that will give you a lot of light and 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.750
 already in this case it's a lilac and look at the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.270
 nice effect it has is not a 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.660
 very difficult makeup what is important here 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.510
 is to define the color have that base that 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.600
 it's what you're told in a beginning 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.510
 no correction 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.960
 that has a proper shape 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:03.330
 that the amount is adequate also 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.289
 We are giving a touch-up right now to the 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.349
 lips and how can you observe having 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.120
 this base dark makeup around 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.090
 of the cheekbones almost does not need to use 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.660
 a blush 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.240
 now we are seeing 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.460
 how are we going to outline the eyebrows 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.820
 this character needs to have a 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.220
 expression also defined in the eyebrows 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.130
 put on the eyelashes that is a technique 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.870
 very simple to apply the glue and 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.050
 very pegadita at the birth of 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.350
 lashes you have to accommodate we have 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.140
 put some butts on the side too 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.650
 a lower lashes tails 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.660
 tabs 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.790
 let's apply a little pencil 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.280
 white inside and finish 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.020
 delineating it in the lower eyelid 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:57.860
 to be able to close 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:01.449
 everything that is the frame of the eyes 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.449
 for the application of the wig 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.190
 if this person has a hair 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.190
 collected 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.680
 you have to always insure it with hooks 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.680
 so that the wig can fit 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.680
 adequately
