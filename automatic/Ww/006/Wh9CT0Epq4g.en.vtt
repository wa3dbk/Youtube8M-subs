00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.920
 hello this is a quick message only 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.520
 I want to comment on the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.370
 so special day the day of 12 12 12 a 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.860
 special day in several senses first 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.949
 that obviously nothing good 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.190
 end-of-the-world theories from which they fell 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.140
 or because obviously wanted asteroids 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.210
 they are without foundation but the interesting thing 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.120
 is that these types of dates are a great 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.820
 pretext for many places of 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.770
 world seek to do meditation is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.520
 search and concentrate of ordering a way 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.860
 in a positive way and it has been proven 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.370
 fact 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.670
 gathering a lot of people and achieving 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.240
 create 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.549
 somehow a great meditation on 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.610
 conflicting cities has been achieved 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.820
 reduce the level of criminality and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.799
 traffic accidents but drastically 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.899
 it's amazing that experiment has been done 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.750
 in Washington in Chicago 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.580
 different cities of the world and have 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.409
 been looking even in the same 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 pentagon had already practiced some 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.890
 have experimented with when 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.340
 pilots who drive the jets to see how 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.740
 the airplane behaves depending on the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.440
 sense of humor depending on whether it is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.630
 he was angry or stressed or not and not that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.560
 they too but the machines and 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.530
 fire when the person we say is 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.079
 a vibration more dense but good thing 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.420
 is that it's obviously a great excuse 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.200
 have come a lot of news the Pope 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.630
 Benedict already announced his first twitter and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 is somehow like a symbol of 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.050
 opening 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.989
 to new technologies from part of 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.989
 this religion on the other hand in singapore 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.330
 and China used this date in many 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.700
 people thousands of people to get married 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.500
 because they consider this date 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.590
 it's good luck 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.989
 well then we'll see how they are doing 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.210
 On the other hand it is also important 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.650
 tell them that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.110
 the 12 12 12 is let's say a capicÃºa date 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.260
 which is not going to repeat until in 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.320
 2.101 the work that of 2101 is acts of 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.210
 application on January 1 or is done inside 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.210
 90 years old 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.230
 in this century that will be the last date 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.390
 of this kind and good changing the subject 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.950
 I just wanted to thank you that the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.760
 today casually talking about 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.560
 numbers we get subscriber 7777 a 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.550
 number that to me and good the person between 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.730
 I'm just not taste is not very 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.580
 let say 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.900
 superstitious but good if he wanted us 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.430
 also comment 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.740
 good in 12 14 12 already happened is a date or 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.630
 is happening at this time the only 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.540
 detail that I have been told the only 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.690
 detail that they told me in costa rica 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 a small tremor at 12 but not 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.709
 exactly at 12 12 but at 12 43 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.049
 and good again on twitter now 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.709
 same are the trending topic to everything 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.890
 remains 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.500
 with this date so there's no 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.260
 attention there are people who have done some 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.140
 type of action has done meditation and that 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.359
 well I think that somehow the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.549
 the world will vibrate better today 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.340
 we hope that this will continue and we are going 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.909
 to see what happens on December 21 of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.799
 2012 that goes in what aspect on how the 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.579
 world somehow joins i think 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.310
 that we are reaching a point 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.560
 climate in social networks which 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 when that no less world of this 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.409
 kind above all there is a kind of union 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.510
 of collection and then we expect nothing more 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.049
 that do not go to fear this guy 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.959
 of things and I think we concentrate on 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.870
 and that connection 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.539
 connect us all as planets and good 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.400
 Well, this is the message for the day of 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.349
 today thanks for yesterday's genre was 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.210
 the really fun truth we see the 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.190
 Saturday and good also on this day
