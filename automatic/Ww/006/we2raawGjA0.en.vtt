00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
when I wasn't doing so well you see a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.949 
when I wasn't doing so well you see a
con<00:02:56.250> co<00:02:56.459> dispossessing<00:02:57.060> Robinho<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.840> on

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
con co dispossessing Robinho there on

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.300 
con co dispossessing Robinho there on
the<00:02:58.050> ball<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.350> he<00:02:58.470> plays<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> true<00:02:58.950> ball<00:02:59.130> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the ball and he plays a true ball that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.490 
the ball and he plays a true ball that
amazingly<00:03:00.120> finds<00:03:00.450> his<00:03:00.630> way<00:03:00.660> true<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.140> Pato<00:03:01.350> you

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
amazingly finds his way true to Pato you

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.930 
amazingly finds his way true to Pato you
know<00:03:01.680> every<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.430> those<00:03:02.640> balls

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
know every now and then those balls

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.699 
know every now and then those balls
finally<00:03:03.360> do<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.660> their<00:03:03.810> way<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.500> just

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
finally do get their way in and it just

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.260 
finally do get their way in and it just
it<00:03:04.860> makes<00:03:05.040> such<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.340> difference<00:03:05.370> plateau

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
it makes such a difference plateau

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.640 
it makes such a difference plateau
coming<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> finesse<00:03:07.230> shot<00:03:07.260> which<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
coming in with the finesse shot which is

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.440 
coming in with the finesse shot which is
bad<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.430> was<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:08.700> happy<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.970> make<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
bad for and I was so happy to make it to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.580 
bad for and I was so happy to make it to
nil<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:11.550> game<00:03:11.790> was<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.590> two-bar

nil and this game was on a two-bar
orange<00:03:14.040> latency<00:03:14.520> which<00:03:14.550> wasn't<00:03:14.970> really<00:03:15.150> very

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
orange latency which wasn't really very

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.000 
orange latency which wasn't really very
good<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.780> was<00:03:15.870> very<00:03:16.110> difficult<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.560> play<00:03:16.739> and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
good it was very difficult to play and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.300 
good it was very difficult to play and
and<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:18.570> I'm<00:03:18.900> done<00:03:19.170> scoring<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.769> goal<00:03:19.830> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and as I'm done scoring that goal this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.860 
and as I'm done scoring that goal this
guy<00:03:20.489> actually<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.150> decided<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.570> he<00:03:21.720> had

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
guy actually just decided that he had

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.390 
guy actually just decided that he had
enough<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.230> he<00:03:22.350> decided<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.769> rage<00:03:22.980> quit<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.340> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
enough and he decided to rage quit and I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.650 
enough and he decided to rage quit and I
knew<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.640> was<00:03:23.760> coming<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.180> soon<00:03:24.269> as<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> press

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
knew it was coming as soon as you press

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
knew it was coming as soon as you press
Start<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.230> knew<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.340> knew<00:03:26.489> why<00:03:26.730> as<00:03:26.910> well

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
Start I knew that and I knew why as well

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.460 
Start I knew that and I knew why as well
I<00:03:27.120> knew<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.480> was<00:03:27.570> because<00:03:27.840> he<00:03:27.989> felt<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.290> he

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
I knew it was because he felt like he

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.259 
I knew it was because he felt like he
dominated<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.190> for<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.459> entire<00:03:29.730> first<00:03:30.150> half

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
dominated me for the entire first half

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.910 
dominated me for the entire first half
like<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.110> see<00:03:31.260> his<00:03:31.440> stats<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
like as you can see his stats on the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.410 
like as you can see his stats on the
right<00:03:32.070> hand<00:03:32.190> side<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.610> are<00:03:32.640> actually<00:03:33.239> what

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
right hand side there are actually what

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.670 
right hand side there are actually what
it<00:03:33.450> starts<00:03:33.810> where<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> half<00:03:34.170> time<00:03:34.350> because<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
it starts where a half time because I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.930 
it starts where a half time because I
barely<00:03:34.920> let<00:03:35.160> him<00:03:35.250> touch<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.430> ball<00:03:35.700> at<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
barely let him touch the ball at the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.850 
barely let him touch the ball at the
side<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.269> second<00:03:36.600> half<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.200> just<00:03:37.590> went<00:03:37.709> out

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
side the second half but I just went out

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.259 
side the second half but I just went out
more<00:03:38.070> determined<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.550> win<00:03:38.670> basically<00:03:39.150> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
more determined to win basically and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.670 
more determined to win basically and
that's<00:03:39.420> what<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.630> was<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.080> do<00:03:40.170> understand

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
that's what it was but I do understand

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's what it was but I do understand
why<00:03:40.769> he<00:03:40.890> was<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.040> bit<00:03:41.160> frustrated<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.790> may<00:03:41.970> have

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
why he was a bit frustrated it may have

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.729 
why he was a bit frustrated it may have
seemed<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.780> didn't<00:03:43.050> deserve<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.320> win<00:03:43.470> that

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
seemed like I didn't deserve to win that

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.070 
seemed like I didn't deserve to win that
game<00:03:43.890> but<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:45.120> trust<00:03:45.390> me<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.570> did<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> next

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
game but but trust me I did the next

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.290 
game but but trust me I did the next
game<00:03:46.320> i<00:03:46.350> go<00:03:46.620> into<00:03:46.830> again<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.090> orange

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830

bizarre reason not the perfect chemistry
thing<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.840> on<00:04:18.900> but<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.470> good<00:04:19.680> team

nonetheless<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.430> I've<00:04:20.489> struggled<00:04:20.700> against

nonetheless and I've struggled against

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.330 
nonetheless and I've struggled against
teams<00:04:21.270> with<00:04:21.359> less<00:04:21.630> chemistry<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
teams with less chemistry so and I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.680 
teams with less chemistry so and I
wasn't<00:04:23.729> really<00:04:23.850> looking<00:04:24.030> forward<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.600> the

wasn't really looking forward to it the

wasn't really looking forward to it the
first<00:04:24.930> half<00:04:25.169> was<00:04:25.380> basic

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
it was passed out actually but it was a

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.200 
it was passed out actually but it was a
great<00:04:35.099> save<00:04:35.310> by<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.550> goalkeeper<00:04:35.999> nonetheless

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
great save by the goalkeeper nonetheless

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.899 
great save by the goalkeeper nonetheless
and<00:04:36.569> he<00:04:36.629> had<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.930> balls<00:04:37.080> he<00:04:37.469> heads<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.189> shows

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
and he had the balls he heads the shows

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.420 
and he had the balls he heads the shows
the<00:04:39.090> ball<00:04:39.210> out<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:39.719> a<00:04:39.749> Inler<00:04:40.740> who<00:04:40.919> turns<00:04:41.189> and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
the ball out to a Inler who turns and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.249 
the ball out to a Inler who turns and
heads<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.729> back<00:04:42.060> into<00:04:42.270> mikkeli<00:04:42.719> and<00:04:42.870> I'm<00:04:42.960> so

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
heads it back into mikkeli and I'm so

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.929 
heads it back into mikkeli and I'm so
surprised<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.949> he<00:04:44.039> wasn't<00:04:44.189> offside<00:04:44.669> as<00:04:44.849> he

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
surprised that he wasn't offside as he

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.369 
surprised that he wasn't offside as he
hit<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.210> into<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.569> back<00:04:45.719> of<00:04:45.749> the<00:04:45.900> net<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.259> I

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
hit that into the back of the net like I

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.749 
hit that into the back of the net like I
was<00:04:46.499> sure<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.740> was<00:04:46.919> offside<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.580> referee

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
was sure it was offside but the referee

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.700 
was sure it was offside but the referee
obviously<00:04:48.240> let<00:04:48.389> it<00:04:48.509> stand<00:04:48.689> and<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.409> wasn't

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
obviously let it stand and it wasn't

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.439 
obviously let it stand and it wasn't
until<00:04:49.830> deep<00:04:50.249> into<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.669> second<00:04:51.029> half<00:04:51.060> that

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
until deep into the second half that

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.700 
until deep into the second half that
something<00:04:51.900> else<00:04:52.050> happened<00:04:52.409> in<00:04:52.499> the<00:04:52.590> game

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
something else happened in the game

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.950 
something else happened in the game

whatever the guy's name is like he was
very<00:05:10.050> much<00:05:10.289> unpacking<00:05:10.590> me<00:05:10.800> for<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.009> whole

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
very much unpacking me for the whole

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.550 
very much unpacking me for the whole
game<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.550> was<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:12.330> felt<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.050> lot<00:05:13.199> of<00:05:13.319> pressure

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
game it was I felt a lot of pressure

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.140 
game it was I felt a lot of pressure
playing<00:05:13.949> it<00:05:14.159> and<00:05:14.250> stuff<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:14.580> as<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.849> game<00:05:14.879> was

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
playing it and stuff but as the game was

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.420 
playing it and stuff but as the game was
over<00:05:15.210> he<00:05:15.509> decided<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.139> make<00:05:16.740> me<00:05:16.919> watch<00:05:17.129> all<00:05:17.370> of

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
over he decided to make me watch all of

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.570 
over he decided to make me watch all of
this<00:05:17.969> entire<00:05:18.330> screen<00:05:18.779> which<00:05:19.439> am<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:20.099> mean<00:05:20.400> I

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
this entire screen which am I mean I

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.429 
this entire screen which am I mean I
don't<00:05:20.610> really<00:05:20.969> care<00:05:21.449> when<00:05:21.689> people<00:05:21.990> do<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.199> I

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
don't really care when people do that I

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.019 
don't really care when people do that I
think<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.949> little<00:05:23.069> bit<00:05:23.219> petty<00:05:23.550> but<00:05:23.849> then

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
think it's a little bit petty but then

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.760 
think it's a little bit petty but then
again<00:05:24.150> I<00:05:24.330> have<00:05:24.659> done<00:05:24.870> it<00:05:24.990> myself<00:05:25.110> particularly

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
again I have done it myself particularly

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.309 
again I have done it myself particularly
if<00:05:26.129> I'm<00:05:26.370> playing<00:05:26.490> against<00:05:26.849> somebody<00:05:27.089> who<00:05:27.419> who

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
if I'm playing against somebody who who

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.200 
if I'm playing against somebody who who
watches<00:05:28.770> all<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:28.979> replay<00:05:29.520> screens<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:30.060> stuff

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
watches all the replay screens and stuff

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.969 
watches all the replay screens and stuff
like<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:31.050> am<00:05:31.259> I<00:05:31.469> thought<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:31.830> he<00:05:31.919> would

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
like that but am I thought that he would
