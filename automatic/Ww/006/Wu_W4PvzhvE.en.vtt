00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:16.070
 in the mountains of cabrils northeast of 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:18.020
 barcelona is the house x its 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.009
 particular way you can recognize 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.009
 better from above 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.429
 it seems to float even though its 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.890
 Solid construction is made of 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.880
 concrete as desired by its owner 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 Greek flavor 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 hello welcome to barcelona 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 welcome to my house come, I'm going 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 to show how my house is 350 meters 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 squares distributed in two floors in 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 the one below are the rooms 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 main 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.360
 this is our living here we spent a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.070
 Lots of time with other friends 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.720
 making meetings and enjoying and about 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 all enjoying these beautiful views 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.309
 that a glass wall is great 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.070
 6 meters high is what allows 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 these views from every room in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 clear days you get to see the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.790
 Mediterranean so as not to have to choose 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710
 between the sea views with the mountain 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.979
 the owner chose the form of x 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.020
 offers privacy in the back and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.190
 spectacular views in the part 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.500
 frontal 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.920
 so the role of nature was that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.370
 nature I entered our house that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 everything is mixed that feels like 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:41.119
 part of the situation and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.250
 and for us nature is a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.470
 situation to solve because here I was 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.509
 there as I say you can not change what 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.090
 we have to solve or change or 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.790
 modify is the construction of this 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 house to stay in touch 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.009
 continuously with nature when 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.200
 We click or designed the house next to a 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.240
 architecture studio came up the idea 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.409
 to decorate the interior with furniture 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 simple and modern 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.200
 this man's favorite place of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480
 business is right next to your 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.349
 office on the first floor here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.349
 get relax 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.040
 clear lines and similar tones 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.200
 Modern furniture dominates 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.560
 combines with the classic like this armchair 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.080
 by charles eames 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.850
 to me what I love about furniture 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.980
 classic is its history 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.700
 everything that is behind that piece of furniture is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.700
 a story is a novel is that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.430
 architecture is engineering 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 are people behind these mobiles there 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.379
 people did not want furniture 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.650
 extravagant wanted something classic something 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.659
 recognizable from the living room is 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.120
 You can access the kitchen through a 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.010
 open this dining table marble 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.959
 seven meters long with the kitchen 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.019
 Integrated was designed exclusively 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.019
 for this house was made in Germania 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.250
 the different axes of the house create the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.490
 border between public space and the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.490
 private 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.040
 good 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.430
 the project is in charge of the architect 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.260
 eduardo cadaval his conception was everything 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.420
 a challenge since never before had 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.670
 built a house with this form the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.500
 construction process was also a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.300
 exercise almost an experiment called us 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.930
 the client because we have certain 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.970
 experience in concrete houses and he 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.750
 I wanted to try a technique 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.239
 novel construction that normally 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.730
 Used in bridges and tunnels to spaces 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.769
 that's why the walls are made with 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.470
 special concrete we have raised 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.100
 6 meter walls with a formwork 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.799
 only on one side then project ent 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.190
 an expensive but successful experiment its 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.810
 construction cost 2 million euros 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.880
 Concrete and glass are its main 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.160
 materials also in the bedrooms 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.389
 the transparent fronts go from 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.389
 floor to ceiling 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.920
 I get up and the first thing I do is 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.650
 open your eyes and from my position 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.770
 bed when I open my eyes what I see is 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.390
 the nature and the beauty of just the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.030
 position that has that has the room 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.580
 because it was thought so it's that not yours 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.990
 thing you do not see nor the house you see you see the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.050
 nature is as if you were sleeping 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.050
 outside 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.270
 Greek flavor lives in the house x with its 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.340
 family for a year and every day 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.970
 happy to have these views so 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.970
 special
