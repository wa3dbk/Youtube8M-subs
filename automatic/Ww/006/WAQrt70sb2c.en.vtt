understand what the difference between
those<00:02:02.189> two<00:02:03.290> components<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.470> inside<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.400> you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
those two components are inside of you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
those two components are inside of you
but<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.049> problem<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.920> belong<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
but the problem is that they belong to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.779 
but the problem is that they belong to
the<00:02:08.579> invisible<00:02:09.090> realm

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
the invisible realm

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.280 
the invisible realm
so<00:02:09.939> that's<00:02:10.119> what<00:02:10.390> makes<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.750> more<00:02:11.049> difficult

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
so that's what makes it more difficult

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.330 
so that's what makes it more difficult
to<00:02:11.950> discern<00:02:12.849> between<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.450> two<00:02:13.659> as<00:02:14.560> most

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
to discern between the two as most

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.880 
to discern between the two as most
people<00:02:15.790> would<00:02:15.970> agree<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.230> universe<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
people would agree the universe is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.160 
people would agree the universe is
divided<00:02:18.549> can<00:02:19.239> be<00:02:19.360> divided<00:02:19.780> into<00:02:19.930> two

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
divided can be divided into two

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.899 
divided can be divided into two
categories<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.950> visible<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.849> invisible

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
categories the visible and the invisible

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.330 
categories the visible and the invisible
the<00:02:22.720> body<00:02:22.959> obviously<00:02:23.620> belongs<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the body obviously belongs to the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.509 
the body obviously belongs to the
visible<00:02:24.670> around<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.930> visible<00:02:26.230> category<00:02:26.890> but

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
visible around the visible category but

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.280 
visible around the visible category but
the<00:02:27.790> other<00:02:27.909> two<00:02:28.150> components<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.810> soul<00:02:29.079> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the other two components the soul the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.110 
the other two components the soul the
spirit<00:02:29.440> belong<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.159> invisible<00:02:30.579> category

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
spirit belong to the invisible category

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.539 
spirit belong to the invisible category
and<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.659> when<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:32.049> get<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:32.470> two<00:02:32.530> mixed<00:02:33.400> up

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
and it's when we get these two mixed up

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.089 
and it's when we get these two mixed up
that<00:02:33.849> trouble<00:02:34.269> begins<00:02:34.569> that's<00:02:35.349> why<00:02:35.650> in

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
that trouble begins that's why in

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.190 
that trouble begins that's why in

from<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.400> spirit<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:51.970> for<00:03:52.690> some<00:03:52.930> reason<00:03:53.409> that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
from the spirit and for some reason that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.409 
from the spirit and for some reason that
is<00:03:53.769> very<00:03:54.099> important<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:54.909> that's<00:03:55.030> why<00:03:55.359> the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
is very important and that's why the

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.970 
is very important and that's why the
Lord<00:03:56.079> decided<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.859> put<00:03:57.069> this<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:58.060> this<00:03:58.299> passage

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
Lord decided to put this in this passage

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.360 
Lord decided to put this in this passage
so<00:04:00.299> that's<00:04:01.299> what<00:04:01.510> we'll<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:01.870> doing<00:04:02.370> now

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
so that's what we'll be doing now

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.610 
so that's what we'll be doing now
studying<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.599> difference<00:04:04.989> between<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.409> soul

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
studying the difference between the soul

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.949 
studying the difference between the soul
and<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.889> spirit<00:04:05.949> and<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:06.699> will<00:04:06.879> do<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.329> in

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
and the spirit and we will do so in

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.659 
and the spirit and we will do so in
increments<00:04:08.319> we'll<00:04:08.739> be<00:04:09.099> studying

the beginning in the original text it

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.140 
the beginning in the original text it
says<00:05:07.740> doesn't<00:05:08.740> written<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.550> first<00:05:09.760> man<00:05:09.970> Adam

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
became a life-giving spirit so that is

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.130 
became a life-giving spirit so that is
again<00:05:17.620> showing<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.670> distinction<00:05:19.120> between<00:05:19.480> the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
again showing a distinction between the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
soul and the spirit the first Adam is

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.470 
soul and the spirit the first Adam is
obviously<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.380> Adam<00:05:24.100> of<00:05:24.300> Genesis<00:05:25.300> the

obviously the the Adam of Genesis the
Adam<00:05:25.870> in<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.020> Garden<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.410> Eden<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:27.400> man<00:05:27.610> who

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
Adam refers to the Lord Jesus Christ so

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.080 
Adam refers to the Lord Jesus Christ so
one<00:05:34.200> was<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.230> living<00:05:35.650> soul<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.700> other<00:05:36.850> one

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
one was a living soul and the other one

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.600 
one was a living soul and the other one
is<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.270> life-giving<00:05:37.540> spirit<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.530> in<00:05:38.890> that<00:05:39.130> we

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
is a life-giving spirit and in that we

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.720 
is a life-giving spirit and in that we
get<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:40.240> distinction<00:05:41.160> between<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.490> soul<00:05:42.700> and

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
get a distinction between the soul and

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.260 
get a distinction between the soul and
the<00:05:42.910> spirit<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.840> soul<00:05:44.080> can<00:05:44.980> harbor<00:05:45.520> life<00:05:45.700> it

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
the spirit the soul can harbor life it

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.270 
the spirit the soul can harbor life it
is<00:05:46.480> a<00:05:46.690> living<00:05:47.290> soul<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.680> can<00:05:47.710> have<00:05:47.980> life

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
is a living soul it can have life

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.140 
is a living soul it can have life
contained<00:05:49.180> inside<00:05:49.420> of<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.960> but<00:05:50.800> if<00:05:51.490> I<00:05:51.610> contrast

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
contained inside of it but if I contrast

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.780 
contained inside of it but if I contrast
the<00:05:52.630> spirit<00:05:53.080> can<00:05:53.410> be<00:05:53.440> life-giving<00:05:54.040> meaning<00:05:54.460> it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
the spirit can be life-giving meaning it

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.760 
the spirit can be life-giving meaning it
can<00:05:55.000> spawn<00:05:55.450> life<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:56.170> that's<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.530> first

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
can spawn life so that's the first

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.860 
can spawn life so that's the first
difference<00:05:56.980> or<00:05:57.640> first<00:05:57.940> distinction<00:05:58.600> we<00:05:58.690> can

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
difference or first distinction we can

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.390 
difference or first distinction we can
make<00:05:59.050> between<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.470> soul<00:05:59.680> and<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.830> spirit<00:05:59.920> the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
make between the soul and the spirit the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.330 
make between the soul and the spirit the
soul<00:06:00.610> can<00:06:00.910> harbor<00:06:01.330> life<00:06:01.510> and<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:02.440> Spirit<00:06:02.860> can

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
soul can harbor life and the Spirit can

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.730 
soul can harbor life and the Spirit can
spawn<00:06:03.820> life

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
spawn life

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.540 
spawn life
now<00:06:05.510> let's<00:06:06.510> go<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:07.350> another<00:06:07.530> difference<00:06:08.250> or

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
now let's go to another difference or

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.100 
now let's go to another difference or
another<00:06:08.790> distinction<00:06:09.300> that<00:06:09.480> will<00:06:09.750> help<00:06:09.870> us

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
another distinction that will help us

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.650 
another distinction that will help us
know<00:06:10.860> what<00:06:11.040> the<00:06:11.160> spirit<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:11.670> versus<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.300> soul

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
know what the spirit is versus the soul

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.500 
know what the spirit is versus the soul
and<00:06:12.900> for<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:13.740> we<00:06:13.920> have<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.130> go<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:15.150> various

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
and for that we have to go to various

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.170 
and for that we have to go to various
passages<00:06:16.020> starting<00:06:16.740> in<00:06:17.120> judges<00:06:18.120> chapter<00:06:18.170> 14
