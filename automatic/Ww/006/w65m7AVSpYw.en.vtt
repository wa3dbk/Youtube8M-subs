00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.330 
dumb hose designer if you look at it it
can<00:02:05.610> exit<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> dust<00:02:06.270> bin<00:02:06.479> about<00:02:06.810> halfway<00:02:07.079> up

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
can exit the dust bin about halfway up

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
can exit the dust bin about halfway up
it<00:02:08.340> goes<00:02:08.519> down<00:02:08.790> through<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.209> guide<00:02:09.509> bracket

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it goes down through this guide bracket

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
it goes down through this guide bracket
and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.459> use<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> attachments<00:02:12.480> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and then to use the attachments you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.509 
and then to use the attachments you
actually<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> disconnect<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
actually have to disconnect it at the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.009 
actually have to disconnect it at the
base<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:17.269> this<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:18.780> left

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
base and then this is what you're left

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.220 
base and then this is what you're left
with<00:02:19.549> this<00:02:20.549> does<00:02:20.790> stretch<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> ways<00:02:21.510> but

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
with this does stretch out a ways but

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
with this does stretch out a ways but
this<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.650> you're<00:02:22.769> supposed<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.070> hook

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
this is what you're supposed to hook

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.729 
this is what you're supposed to hook
your<00:02:23.519> handle<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:25.290> use<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.269> attachments

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
your handle to to use the attachments

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.800 
your handle to to use the attachments
and<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.310> almost<00:02:29.519> near<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> floor<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and this is almost near the floor so you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.170 
and this is almost near the floor so you
might<00:02:30.989> get<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> couple<00:02:31.470> feet<00:02:31.829> out<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.250> but

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
might get a couple feet out of this but

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.310 
might get a couple feet out of this but
it's<00:02:33.329> just<00:02:33.359> absolutely<00:02:33.930> dumbest<00:02:34.290> design<00:02:34.620> ever

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
it's just absolutely dumbest design ever

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's just absolutely dumbest design ever
so<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.500> connect<00:02:37.799> this<00:02:37.920> back<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.420> maybe<00:02:42.440> show

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so if we connect this back on maybe show

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.819 
so if we connect this back on maybe show
you<00:02:43.500> how<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.829> works<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:46.200> clean<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> power

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
you how this works just clean the power

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.520 
you how this works just clean the power
switches<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.640> top<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.290> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
switches here at the top there is a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.590 
switches here at the top there is a
on/off<00:02:50.250> switch<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.670> there's<00:02:50.910> also<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
on/off switch and there's also a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.449 
on/off switch and there's also a
separate<00:02:52.440> switch<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:52.950> brush<00:02:53.160> roller

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
separate switch for the brush roller

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:24.149 
separate switch for the brush roller
right<00:02:53.700> here

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.220 

so<00:03:25.159> overall<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.849> vacuuming<00:03:26.269> performance<00:03:26.870> is

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so overall the vacuuming performance is

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.119 
so overall the vacuuming performance is
average<00:03:28.099> at<00:03:28.370> best<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:30.230> doesn't<00:03:30.260> have<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.769> lot<00:03:30.980> of

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
average at best it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.190 
average at best it doesn't have a lot of
suction<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:32.209> holes<00:03:32.450> diameter<00:03:33.019> at<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
suction the holes diameter at the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.850 
suction the holes diameter at the
fittings<00:03:33.620> are<00:03:33.769> fairly<00:03:34.040> narrow<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:36.650> motor

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
fittings are fairly narrow and the motor

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.520 
fittings are fairly narrow and the motor
itself<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.459> fairly<00:03:37.849> anemic<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:39.290> really

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
itself is fairly anemic it's really

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.020 
itself is fairly anemic it's really
limited<00:03:39.709> by<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.069> amount<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.489> power<00:03:40.700> source

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
limited by the amount of power source

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.660 
limited by the amount of power source
available<00:03:41.599> so<00:03:42.530> if<00:03:42.890> you're<00:03:43.040> expecting<00:03:43.310> us<00:03:43.579> to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
available so if you're expecting us to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
available so if you're expecting us to
replace<00:03:43.970> your<00:03:44.180> home<00:03:44.329> vacuum<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.840> forget<00:03:45.140> it

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
replace your home vacuum and forget it

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.350 
replace your home vacuum and forget it
if<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:46.129> want<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:46.549> for<00:03:46.730> light<00:03:46.909> pickups

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
if you want it just for light pickups

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.339 
if you want it just for light pickups
and<00:03:47.709> routine<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.190> know<00:03:49.280> touch-up<00:03:49.670> cleaning

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
and routine you know touch-up cleaning

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.490 
and routine you know touch-up cleaning
yeah<00:03:51.349> it'll<00:03:51.650> work<00:03:51.709> just<00:03:51.829> fine<00:03:52.069> but<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.959> know<00:03:54.470> I

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
yeah it'll work just fine but you know I

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.789 
yeah it'll work just fine but you know I
would<00:03:54.860> think<00:03:55.299> twice<00:03:56.299> about<00:03:56.540> spending<00:03:56.780> $300<00:03:57.650> on

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
would think twice about spending $300 on

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.759 
would think twice about spending $300 on
this<00:03:57.829> again<00:03:58.310> if<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.810> know<00:03:59.900> thinking<00:04:00.680> this

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
this again if you you know thinking this

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.880 
this again if you you know thinking this
is<00:04:00.890> going<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.099> replace<00:04:01.280> your<00:04:01.400> home<00:04:01.670> vacuum<00:04:02.890> let

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
is going to replace your home vacuum let

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.790 
is going to replace your home vacuum let
me<00:04:03.920> know<00:04:04.040> if<00:04:04.129> you<00:04:04.190> got<00:04:04.280> any<00:04:04.400> questions
