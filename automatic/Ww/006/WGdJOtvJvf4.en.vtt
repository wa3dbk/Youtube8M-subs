00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 many friends and friends of recipes for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.910
 cook today I prepare the tidbits of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.500
 chicken breast with breadcrumbs and chips 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.410
 we need four beaten eggs 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.630
 for breading always for breading 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.109
 if you still need a package of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.340
 crumbled chips and some flour 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.550
 we need hard wheat instead 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.910
 of a chicken breast and for the sauce 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 a little mayonnaise, a little lemon and some 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 parsley 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.270
 cut our breasts into pieces 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 chicken 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.400
 then first striped like this and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.330
 then 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 from morsels of this size here 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.160
 now we commit our tidbits of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.580
 chicken breast so we pass them first 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.580
 in the flour 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.840
 let's move on then 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 in the beaten egg 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.520
 then we pass the morsels in the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 crumbled chips and we finish the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
 breading 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 this is the breading of chips first 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.450
 to make them fry we prepare the sauce of 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.979
 accompaniment then we squeeze the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.090
 then mayonnaise in a small bowl 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.090
 put the parsley 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.640
 and finish by squeezing a little lemon 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.540
 then we go to fry our 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.540
 bocconcini 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.150
 then we serve morsels with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.840
 our sauce after having unstuck them 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 oil
