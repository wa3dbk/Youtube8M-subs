Spartan<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.480> way<00:02:53.599> trucks<00:02:53.989> were

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
Spartan but that's the way trucks were

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.970 
Spartan but that's the way trucks were
back<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.830> at<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.730> time

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.120 

yes<00:03:00.550> cap

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:13.470 

and<00:03:03.490> there<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> beautiful<00:03:06.310> truck

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.970 

I<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.330> windshield<00:03:26.140> cranked<00:03:26.740> out

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
I think the windshield cranked out

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.740 
I think the windshield cranked out
somewhat<00:03:27.670> for<00:03:27.970> ventilation<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:31.270> that's<00:03:31.480> why

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
somewhat for ventilation and that's why

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.460 
somewhat for ventilation and that's why
the<00:03:31.810> wipers<00:03:32.770> are<00:03:32.950> from<00:03:33.160> about
