00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.690
 all with you pay players word for it 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.779
 today I would like to again address 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.290
 remarkable field proven under 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.120
 the title is just recently me 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.750
 managed to lose paint continued 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.830
 the first two parts have changed and 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.139
 implementers madrid called bargaining 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.270
 the game was made clear by the fans of the series 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.640
 by a very famous movie of the same name 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.460
 the name of the sense that in translation means 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640
 the best shooter comments I got 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.369
 about the same as banks and items 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.869
 that is, not without the help of our pirates 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 conscientiously worked 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 I believe that Europe was four 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.930
 there I was only interested in Afghan 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.170
 the sale was to replenish your 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.920
 a small 32 3 wild flowing from here 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 I just saw debts 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.860
 among other internet cards 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.980
 for some reason there is again a block for the first 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.260
 part of the price and the unexpected 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 desperate I bought and the second part 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.130
 Thank God so it would seem 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.730
 places 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.250
 I must say that the first two two series 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.020
 developed in turn with such 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.880
 channel but then their continuation 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.020
 Syrian anyone I told 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.879
 lower and lower vanavar 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.870
 not yet come yet 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.880
 before i used to review this game 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.680
 so to say that the pirates understood create 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.790
 even cover my brainchild so I'm with 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.120
 dallas 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.300
 in general, what game 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.299
 such covers 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.479
 bring it exactly is a nazi 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 condrin 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080
 I have questions 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 we must look at this fight 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.050
 seriously you can't even miss out 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.610
 fought key so constantly when 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 entering the group we must 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.570
 look at it with nothing 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 remarkable need 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 it seems that they owe him something 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 The game was made in 1925 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.820
 but the beginning of the gameplay 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.600
 standard view as in the previous parts 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.409
 and now we can even sneak up and and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.530
 the rear company of our flying ship 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.260
 first you need to do not shoot 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.140
 Prague eminent and becomes even 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.310
 a little fun but what happens then 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.049
 to tixi porting to this 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.010
 the idea 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.910
 guess 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.380
 what occupies the most part 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.300
 gameplay 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 see for yourself 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.650
 having personally flown 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.420
 I think at this rate you can fly 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 furious years 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.510
 in general, here are the flights to the other end 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.770
 of light is the main component part 1 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 swam 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.249
 it will take forever then what will happen 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.169
 then weird annoying art and i 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:19.959
 understand 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.680
 my planes approaching rocket 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.560
 but without hesitation shoot down and here are the first 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.169
 impressions of the game are terrible 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.879
 well what needs to be said here 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:28.859
 look what a wonderful 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.870
 protests shot it reached that shoot 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.739
 threads 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.909
 in general, pirates however tried so they 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.739
 nothing worked out graphically 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.959
 play yourself now let's sound 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.169
 accompanying 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.089
 sounds pretty good especially 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.119
 computer sounds and explosions but what about 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.119
 music 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.469
 and i'm not here playing even because of this 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.769
 getting incredibly boring 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.849
 the plot of the game and frankly did not understand 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:55.889
 seemingly can be destroyed 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.439
 a certain amount of enemy 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.359
 fighters 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.269
 but here apparently the creators did not 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.119
 torture yourself and just made a banal 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.899
 assignments 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.399
 before the mission was given some sort 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.960
 information in small letters 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.680
 back on a black background 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.420
 but I don't think there is a convocation going into 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.040
 details as if there was not all the same 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.330
 Tom Country was created on the basis of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.170
 the first two parts and naturally 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.459
 game interfaces are very similar 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.179
 the same on-board computer floor crane 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.689
 the truth of the first two looked 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.589
 prettier body will be approximately 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.609
 the same but still the second game all the same 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.619
 the most dynamic gameplay and she also 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.789
 characterized by the presence of music in the game as 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:29.559
 make her the best game of this 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.559
 trilogy still flying a little beaten yet 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:32.859
 one fighter on-board computer 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.509
 there was a strange message and then I 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:36.619
 was amazed 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.589
 it's hard to believe but that's the way the game 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.409
 there is a second mission giving what after all 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.219
 becomes third person 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.569
 there is a competent expert in Italy 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.049
 excludes itself 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.779
 that's why they couldn't make the game 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.179
 in this mode 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.469
 he got two great if europe 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.039
 did not go unnoticed 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.859
 but it seems I was happy early 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.169
 even at this landing site this pit 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.959
 pour unpleasant memories in the first 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 parts 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.230
 it's impossible to figure it out 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.430
 when what 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.769
 and generally where to laugh 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.769
 and here is the result 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.400
 what the fuck was it less like 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.870
 landed 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.750
 how could there have been a landing affected 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.889
 the end of the mission does that point give 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.659
 less 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.490
 you ask and what next 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.629
 of course the second assignment 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:27.719
 and then fundamentally 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.129
 pointless to tell 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.860
 everything is repeated in the same way 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.530
 but only our second tier I don't 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.960
 gone and accordingly the third stock is nothing 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.620
 but I know one thing 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.670
 this play is incredibly sad shit which 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.580
 passed by all levels 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.750
 I think even what would tell you about 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.940
 how did the pirates 90 do or 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.270
 and we have this annoying organ 3 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.409
 personally I would take a ticket to play this game 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.879
 for a long time not using the game arbiter decision 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.959
 Well, specifically they sent 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:55.509
 simulators 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.939
 and I proudly present 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.069
 opportunity to activate this 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.300
 the game according to his assistant named 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.930
 May 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.930
 money you her 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.879
 RBK 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.300
 behind 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.590
 is not it 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.030
 Klitschko
