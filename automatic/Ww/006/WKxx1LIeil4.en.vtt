00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
see in this video I'm going to copy a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.430 
see in this video I'm going to copy a
single<00:00:14.580> frame<00:00:14.880> from<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.240> video<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.929> the

single frame from the video to the
clipboard<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:23.330> then<00:00:24.330> I'll<00:00:24.510> paste<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.080> image

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
clipboard and then I'll paste that image

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.730 
clipboard and then I'll paste that image
in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
in

3d<00:00:26.160> lut<00:00:26.369> creator<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.210> open<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.320> curves<00:00:28.529> page

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.670 

by<00:00:32.430> pressing<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.059> degrade<00:00:33.480> button<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.110> can

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
by pressing the degrade button I can

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
by pressing the degrade button I can
extract<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> curves<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.970> image<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
extract the curves from the image and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
extract the curves from the image and
those<00:00:36.960> curves<00:00:37.320> show<00:00:37.920> me<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.400> original

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
those curves show me that the original

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.350 
those curves show me that the original
was<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> grayscale<00:00:39.780> image<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
was a grayscale image so I have the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.729 
was a grayscale image so I have the
curves<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.019> restore<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.650> original

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
curves that restore the original

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.390 
curves that restore the original
greyscale<00:00:44.699> image<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.449> graded<00:00:45.840> blue<00:00:46.050> one

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
greyscale image from the graded blue one

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.920 
greyscale image from the graded blue one
this<00:00:47.400> degraded<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:48.269> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.720> we're

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this degraded look is the one we're

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.140 
this degraded look is the one we're
going<00:00:49.080> to<00:00:49.170> archive<00:00:49.760> reversing<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> curves

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
going to archive reversing the curves

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.030 
going to archive reversing the curves
will<00:00:51.390> double<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> effect<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.559> applied<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
will double the effect when applied to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.070 
will double the effect when applied to
this<00:00:53.190> image<00:00:55.820> let's<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.120> take<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.600> image<00:00:57.839> that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
this image let's now take the image that

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.340 
this image let's now take the image that
we<00:00:58.229> want<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.500> grade<00:01:02.269> when<00:01:03.269> we<00:01:03.299> paste<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.110> image

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
we want to grade when we paste the image

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
we want to grade when we paste the image
the<00:01:04.739> current<00:01:05.040> curves<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.549> replied<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the current curves are replied is the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.330 
the current curves are replied is the
original<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.549> effect<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.190> that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
original and the effect now all that's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.320 
original and the effect now all that's
left<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.210> desaturate<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.440> colors

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
left to do is to desaturate the colors

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
left to do is to desaturate the colors
and<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.630> also<00:01:16.049> add<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.590> contrast<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and we can also add more contrast and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.620 
and we can also add more contrast and
make<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> sky<00:01:18.840> darker<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.760> pin<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
make the sky darker to do this I pin the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.679 
make the sky darker to do this I pin the
neutral<00:01:22.020> point<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.820> darken<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.510> blue

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
neutral point and then darken the blue

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
neutral point and then darken the blue
colors<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.900> I'll<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.320> everything<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
colors and I'll just make everything a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.220 
colors and I'll just make everything a
little<00:01:29.340> bit<00:01:29.490> lighter

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.990 

this<00:01:33.230> is<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.560> result<00:01:34.180> before<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.510> after<00:01:36.500> I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.710 

can<00:01:41.000> apply<00:01:41.300> this<00:01:41.360> grading<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.260> other<00:01:42.530> photos

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.020 

is<00:01:48.160> before<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.430> after

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.780 

here's<00:01:56.020> another<00:01:56.200> example<00:01:59.520> again<00:02:01.380> before<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
here's another example again before and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.100 
here's another example again before and
after

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.459 

thanks<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.260> watching<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.830> bye<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.280> now
