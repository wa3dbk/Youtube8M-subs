00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 I'm exactly 333 for real points and 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.330
 I'm going to show you how to hack the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.400
 pension so they can play the children 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.969
 ixe wishes 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.490
 commented is doing the post 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.340
 presence and tutorials 31635 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.869
 officials 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.780
 I have a psp 3001 configure 631 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 now I'm going to show you we're going to 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.529
 adjust the system 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.200
 you see let's go to the integration option 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.890
 what is system information 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.590
 and if you can see what it says 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.590
 a good one says version 6.31 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.630
 6.31 if you can see more or less good 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.270
 what they have to do is lower the bread 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.690
 what did kant swisher say ? 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.680
 what they download are these folders 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.680
 Now let's look 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.720
 these folders what they have to do 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.710
 is to replace them with the originals of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.620
 the psp2 already 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:21.590
 and replace it and just in case he says 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:24.010
 backup of the ship tape esp esp 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.660
 some replaced 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.480
 I do not have the playlist that I am 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.450
 testing and all work 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.350
 once the archives company we go 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.510
 to the psp and we can confirm 65 I do not have 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 so we 're going to the game menu this 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.409
 It is not 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.409
 at least 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.070
 As it explains 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.900
 it's a gesture for them to play 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.420
 we go to the demo or the demo as 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.350
 some tell you 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.770
 in this game 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.770
 the mine does not go up and then so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.730
 it depends on everything 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 we hope everything changes 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.140
 it's a tube 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.590
 good the main goal circle 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.770
 to people letters 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.489
 if we put the llanero 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.489
 wait a few moments 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.730
 and you will go to the main menu of the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.420
 psc 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.660
 but in french 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.660
 Nothing was born 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.990
 here 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.020
 Let's see 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.120
 i 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.750

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.470
 He passed 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.280
 again 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.280
 all 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 Well, you can advance the video a bit 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.040

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.910

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180
 5 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.780
 in a matter of truth until 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.820
 grip 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.880
 He asks twice now he gets out 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.050
 main menu we go to the information 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.050
 system adjustment 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.960
 without training of the system and as well 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.180
 can see now the version happened to be 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.160
 631 prop 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.050
 more or less you can see a seal by 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.840
 this week with a cell phone 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.070
 that's why he commented the 333 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.340
 your love of the 6.31 system and once done 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.889
 that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.510
 what we have to do is connect the 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.700
 spice back 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.569
 [Applause] 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.699
 if we can connect 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.699
 to college data 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.610
 To get where we are, we open it 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.380
 good in the root folder of the 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.010
 country directory in my case is and points 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.100
 bars we created a folder called did 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.870
 that will be made we created it right click 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.930
 in a folder the teacher did not 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.260
 capitals and we enter those just already 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.430
 I have the eyes keep it back but 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.440
 they really should not have anything 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.009
 I'm going to go up a couple of games 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:04.970
 I'm going to try and 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.790
 they copy any European game 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.680
 once stuck they close 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.680
 always remember to take them out here 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.800
 and we can disconnect the psp 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:28.590
 we are going 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.500
 at least symbolic games and we 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.710
 we direct to 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.710
 averages floor to both 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.340
 we access now we can access but 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.210
 will not say that they are damaged if not 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.210
 we do the previous case 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:59.450
 Here are the options to follow in Spanish that 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.220
 they are still selected did as I have 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.560
 only codices god of war centers 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.560
 four reforms we select with x 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.100
 to set the 30 to 60 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.819
 and good all the advertisements 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.370
 and here we have forgiveness 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:33.869
 overcoming 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.710
