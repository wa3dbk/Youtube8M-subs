00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.780
 hi girls i want you to make a video 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.570
 on the stylized rose 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.100
 dinner wants to do on this type 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.040
 that yesterday I tried to make the effect 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.250
 trail of site marks and I want to do it 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.170
 for dinner nails because I can see them 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.690
 yesterday he is trying to do today 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.670
 precisely the rose is stylized and has some 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.980
 of difficulty in this regard 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 and here I show him a little how 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 I do it 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 then I always use brush two 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.660
 as I have already told you many times 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.809
 I immerse the tip right into the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 color I am using acrylic color 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:01:01.890
 then white begins 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.220
 I'm trying to move a little bit 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.460
 camera because the frame was not 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 very correct then always started with 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.950
 the tip of the brush and I make a 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:33.840
 small central semicircle in this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 so then with the tip of the brush a lot 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 I turn around slightly then slightly 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 crush the back up with the tip 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 and I do the same thing below 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.230
 so always with the tip of the brush 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.140
 light from you that I have to take some 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.870

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.350
 light brush crushes and then comes back 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.880
 up and then I go on 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.880

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.050

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.050
