00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.399
 Hello, my 10 is a simulator 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.959
 tetris expel imagined that 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.780
 butt without music 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.480
 my gosh you can not imagine the land for 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.030
 we launch each such 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580
 run and what's the catch here 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.619
 trick ask yes in order and that in 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.320
 tom to place all the figures somehow 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.949
 actually the soup itself kid ink ft content 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.570
 clearer wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.609
 rolls rolls over 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.220
 proper physics physics in this game you 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.470
 just great i would i compare i 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.600
 perhaps with physics in bass effende 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.610
 somewhere somewhere in such a place and 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.470
 actually what is the feature 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.810
 this game is up to fit all 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.590
 these figures the larger the figure you fit 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.600
 so much better here is the angle down such 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.370
 articles are nothing here more than a figure 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.960
 purely is better so more and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.790
 break up if you're there with all the dope like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.040
 understand so apparently 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.200
 I realized this is actually very 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.770
 fun toy as long sticks and 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.059
 music is i just don't know it when 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.820
 once recorded on tape with 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.520
 dictaphone in childhood and then served 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.159
 in the process and the stubborn thing recorded 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.910
 this melody on voice recorder and and 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.350
 and the very Tetris and pears are so true 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.710
 it was not really tetris was very 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.479
 reaching gambling although no 100 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.840
 points a hundred there was no such music 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.740
 leg 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.330
 I I I recorded what was the use of all 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.119
 wasn't I had this music no i didn't 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.520
 I know why, but here's the best 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.560
 physics think think better physics in general 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.800
 this year although the game is created figs knows 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.440
 what year is it two years ago you were created 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.440
 agree idea just awesome tax 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.430
 Taxi Taxi Taxi Taxi ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.610
 all words of yutz 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.149
 come on 100 nodding at the article on the article 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:58.990
 1 articles on the article my goodness 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.750
 oh no no come on let 's go normal 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.310
 should win well no no more true 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.470
 you will not win at least not lose 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.050
 gotta curtains 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.130
 tetris is one of my favorite games 8 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.410
 tags icon 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.720
 dachshund quietly quietly quietly not gods 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.950
 got up 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:28.600
 base as well, come on already finally Kelly did not 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.650
 some line broke but did not stay 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.020
 food will break like that everywhere else 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.209
 the line broke fine just like that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.060
 let's break everything you need to number 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.850
 everything breaks perfectly just i don't know 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.370
 all beautiful i'm looking for them yes i'm still like in 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.420
 although your game is not really fucking 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.030
 understands what it all depends well, not bad 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.980
 things are going so quite interesting to yourself 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.880
 toy here perhaps on this I finish 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.830
 it somehow 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 watch me play tetris a little 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.430
 strange probably for you 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.170
 or not or yes but generally yes you know what 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 Dad, too, just suck a fool lupi to 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.120
 they are when you are not pressed down below 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.750
 it's all a unit that I understood the gameplay 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.739
 but perhaps even no, I think that over the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.590
 calculating where the floor is and there is for example physics 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.840
 you will agree fun thing here a 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.400
 this is my principle than 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.890
 so as not to bore you the tetris game 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.269
 that you yourself have played it is a link to 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.940
 the game in the video description 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.819
 But on this I have all 100 and those 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.319
 who watched this video and subscribe to 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.079
 channel put comments to sleep with you 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.620
 was dick and I have such a request who knows 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.569
 where to download normal sims then ok 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.099
 sims that sense to cooperation from 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.329
 additions student life in general in 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.849
 Ideally, because I have long wanted to understand 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.829
 make videos and on by student life 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.150
 here night nobody could get tired 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.220
 in a normal way it somehow needed 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.040
 the original sims ii what 's in particular 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.689
 dermatitis would all be together 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.780
 that somehow I wanted to play this sims 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.129
 yes here it is not all and see you soon 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.930
 See you all for now 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.359
 play good games good for example 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 somehow because nothing like i 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.000
 not yet seen and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
 in my very good 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.160
 retrospective I dreamed to the same 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.420
 made 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.390
 although to watch this do not 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.770
 so there for example mushrooms just 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.900
 boris titov's hallucinogen though them 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.720
 there is parody on mario is on to 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.670
 the sea who remembers will understand wheezing okay 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.690
 Generally there she is we carry this and see you soon 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.690
 See you all for now
