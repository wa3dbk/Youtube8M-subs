00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.340
 what is homeopathy 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.600

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.770

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.909
 continuous update 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.630
 Now let's move on to what is the 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.310
 today's topic 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.310
 what is homeopathy 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.500
 let's start 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.620
 with the etymological definition created by 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.770
 the doctor encourages the word homeopathy 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.120
 is composed of two Latin words the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:26.110
 first or meo which means similar 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.340
 similar like and ducks that means 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.170
 disease, suffering or suffering 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.510
 then we define the word 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.060
 homeopathy as a similar disease or 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.460
 similar disease 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.579
 I let the'll explain as follows 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 way my empathy is based on a law 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.509
 the law of similarity if homeopathy 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 it is a medicine that is based on this law 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.340
 of similarity as described by the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.439
 doctor hahnemann simile and simile and search 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.470
 on tour this means that the 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.289
 similar heal the like must 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.420
 understood as follows 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.939
 a certain substance can cure 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.100
 the symptoms it causes to understand 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.709
 I explain this in a better way with a 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.880
 example that can be known by the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.880
 most readers 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.500
 chop onion imagine you're in your 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.110
 kitchen and it is in front of you a 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.080
 chopping board a knife and an onion 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 your job is to cut it into very 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.180
 little ones 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.730
 so you start chopping the onion 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 and when cut it fills the environment 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.219
 of your particles which you identify 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 for its characteristic smell but also 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.870
 begins your body to react from a 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.349
 peculiar shape your eyes are put 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.670
 Tearful you burn and as it usually happens 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.489
 begins to run down your nose a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.680
 transparent and watery liquid while 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.250
 begins to sneeze 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.980
 remember this now I'm going to ask you to 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.290
 erase that image from your mind now 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.250
 imagine that a person arrives 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.060
 to your office but you see his eyes 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.049
 watery runny nose sounds 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.049
 every time the nose 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 let me ask you something 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.060
 of these two images that you imagine that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.620
 it happens to the person who comes from chopping 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.409
 onion 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.220
 or who suffers from some type of flu or 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.900
 allergy 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.900
 I'm going for the second 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.720
 in this way myopathy is 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.700
 How homeopathic medicine works 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:53.470
 arises from natural substances 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:58.780
 that produce in him the healthy person 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.780
 symptoms of disease-like 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.200
 so the onion changes its name to 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.599
 someone stops homeopathic medicine 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 which has as properties and qualities 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.760
 relieve many flu pictures 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.760
 similar to the symptoms that produce 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.359
 we conclude that if thousands and thousands current 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.609
 ur is actually the first pillar of the 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.590
 which maintain homeopathy since 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.050
 we could define that this is the method 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.050
 therapeutic of similarity of symptoms 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.309
