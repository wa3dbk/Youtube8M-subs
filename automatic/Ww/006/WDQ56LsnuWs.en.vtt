00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
they push him out maybe because they

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.619

think Garuda was very upset I don't know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.610 
think Garuda was very upset I don't know
exactly<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.780> became<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:11.190> be<00:01:11.220> ill<00:01:11.550> but<00:01:12.620> I

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
exactly when they became to be ill but I

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.330 
exactly when they became to be ill but I
don't<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:16.340> correlation

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
don't know if there is correlation

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
don't know if there is correlation
between<00:01:19.460> those<00:01:20.460> situations<00:01:21.150> Paris<00:01:21.720> Opera<00:01:21.930> he

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
between those situations Paris Opera he

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420 
between those situations Paris Opera he
changed<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> lot

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
changed a lot

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
changed a lot
from<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.760> beginning<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:24.960> fight<00:01:25.260> a<00:01:25.290> lot

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.430 
from the beginning and he fight a lot
and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.030> by<00:01:27.210> little<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.960> took<00:01:28.230> away

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
and then little by little they took away

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.180 
and then little by little they took away
the<00:01:28.620> chair<00:01:29.070> from<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:30.300> him<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:31.710> give<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
the chair from from him to give it to

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.300 
the chair from from him to give it to
somebody<00:01:32.430> else

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
somebody else

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
somebody else
and<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.580> me<00:01:35.760> it<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.050> was<00:01:37.080> not<00:01:37.440> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and for me it was not it was not I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.430 
and for me it was not it was not I
wanted<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.330> could<00:01:39.540> stay<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.350> he

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
wanted he could he could stay and he

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.270 
wanted he could he could stay and he
could<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:42.380> saw<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.010> possible

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
could I saw that it was not possible

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.150 
could I saw that it was not possible
because<00:01:44.730> it's<00:01:45.690> not<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.230> only<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.680> physical

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
because it's not not only for physical

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.470 
because it's not not only for physical
reasons<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:48.090> far<00:01:48.860> for<00:01:50.180> personal<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
reasons it was far for personal and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.620 
reasons it was far for personal and
intimate<00:01:52.640> reasons<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.940> don't<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.180> exactly

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
intimate reasons I I don't know exactly

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.110 
intimate reasons I I don't know exactly
I<00:01:55.040> think<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.430> Rudolf<00:01:56.820> had<00:01:57.000> exerted<00:01:57.270> his<00:01:57.600> will

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
I think that Rudolf had exerted his will

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120 
I think that Rudolf had exerted his will
successfully<00:02:00.120> over<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:00.900> many<00:02:01.110> things<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.980> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
successfully over so many things and I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
successfully over so many things and I
think<00:02:02.370> what<00:02:02.490> happened<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.970> him<00:02:03.120> at<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> end

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
think what happened to him at the end

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.560 
think what happened to him at the end
really<00:02:03.720> was<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:05.010> for<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.430> first<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
really was now for the first time in so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.320 
really was now for the first time in so
many<00:02:06.720> areas<00:02:07.399> his<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.269> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
many areas his will was not going to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.940 
many areas his will was not going to
make<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> difference<00:02:09.750> anymore

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
make the difference anymore

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.559 
make the difference anymore
he<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.220> believed<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.730> something<00:02:14.000> would

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
he just believed that something would

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.300 
he just believed that something would
come<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.140> save<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.680> day<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.069> he<00:02:16.190> would

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
come and save the day and he would

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.040 
come and save the day and he would
continue<00:02:16.610> because<00:02:17.120> he<00:02:17.360> believed<00:02:17.780> in

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
continue because he believed in

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
continue because he believed in
longevity<00:02:18.530> he<00:02:19.099> thought<00:02:19.310> he<00:02:19.400> was<00:02:19.520> going<00:02:19.640> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
longevity he thought he was going to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.150 
longevity he thought he was going to
live<00:02:19.910> well<00:02:20.150> into<00:02:20.300> his<00:02:20.450> 90s<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> he<00:02:21.800> talked
