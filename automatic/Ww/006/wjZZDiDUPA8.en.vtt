00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
on the white cluster is on the back of

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.699 
on the white cluster is on the back of
the<00:01:52.969> fan<00:01:53.179> is<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.539> switch<00:01:53.929> for<00:01:54.170> selecting<00:01:54.590> your

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
the fan is a switch for selecting your

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.349 
the fan is a switch for selecting your
performance<00:01:55.219> range<00:01:55.429> you<00:01:56.029> can<00:01:56.149> pick<00:01:56.329> between

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
performance range you can pick between

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.789 
performance range you can pick between
800<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.560> 1500<00:01:57.950> rpm<00:01:58.549> 800<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.149> 1800<00:01:59.719> rpm<00:02:00.079> or<00:02:00.289> 800

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.800 

one<00:02:07.550> other<00:02:07.700> cool<00:02:07.850> thing<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.300> that<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> back

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
one other cool thing is that on the back

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.150 
one other cool thing is that on the back
of<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.020> fans<00:02:09.290> are<00:02:09.470> four<00:02:09.680> little<00:02:09.950> rubber

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
of the fans are four little rubber

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.980 
of the fans are four little rubber
stickers<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.910> helps<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.330> sound<00:02:11.660> dampening

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
stickers that helps do sound dampening

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.570 
stickers that helps do sound dampening
but<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.620> comes<00:02:12.800> with<00:02:12.980> an<00:02:13.070> extra<00:02:13.160> set<00:02:13.520> of

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
but it comes with an extra set of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.190 
but it comes with an extra set of
stickers<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:14.150> well<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.690> add<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> second

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
stickers as well so if you add a second

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.140 
stickers as well so if you add a second
fan<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:15.710> add<00:02:15.920> those<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.520> fan<00:02:16.850> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
fan you can add those to the fan and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.930 
fan you can add those to the fan and
it'll<00:02:17.390> help<00:02:17.540> dampen<00:02:17.840> some<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.350> vibration

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
it'll help dampen some of the vibration

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.130 
it'll help dampen some of the vibration
we<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.060> did<00:02:20.150> some<00:02:20.330> quick<00:02:20.540> testing<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
we just did some quick testing on a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.130 
we just did some quick testing on a
workbench<00:02:21.380> PC<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.100> was<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> Intel<00:02:22.760> i5<00:02:22.940> 35<00:02:23.600> 70<00:02:23.990> K

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
workbench PC it was a Intel i5 35 70 K

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.760 
workbench PC it was a Intel i5 35 70 K
at<00:02:25.130> idle<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:25.820> about<00:02:26.030> 35<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.900> under<00:02:27.380> load

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
at idle it was about 35 and under load

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.940 
at idle it was about 35 and under load
it<00:02:28.160> peaked<00:02:28.490> at<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:28.970> 65<00:02:29.630> both<00:02:30.470> he<00:02:30.680> sings

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
it peaked at about 65 both he sings

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.950 
it peaked at about 65 both he sings
performed<00:02:31.460> basically<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.390> same<00:02:32.540> even<00:02:32.870> though

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
performed basically the same even though

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.450 
performed basically the same even though
they<00:02:33.050> had<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> different<00:02:33.410> fan<00:02:33.740> configuration

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
they had a different fan configuration

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.720 
they had a different fan configuration
we<00:02:35.120> were<00:02:35.240> running<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> fans<00:02:35.810> at<00:02:36.050> max<00:02:36.980> speed<00:02:37.160> in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
we were running the fans at max speed in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.660 
we were running the fans at max speed in
both<00:02:38.060> cases<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.980> white<00:02:40.130> fans<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.520> little

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
both cases so the white fans a little

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.910 
both cases so the white fans a little
bit<00:02:40.880> faster<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.750> was<00:02:41.900> maybe<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.590> degree

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
bit faster it was maybe one degree

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.530 
bit faster it was maybe one degree
cooler<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:43.490> that's<00:02:43.670> within<00:02:43.850> margin<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.360> error

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
cooler but that's within margin of error

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.060 
cooler but that's within margin of error
so<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> don't<00:02:45.110> know<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.440> would<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.830> would

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
so I don't know that I would I would

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.580 
so I don't know that I would I would
commit<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:48.020> performance<00:02:48.470> was

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
commit to that but the performance was

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.590 
commit to that but the performance was
pretty<00:02:48.740> solid<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.220> both<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.760> there<00:02:50.570> is

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
pretty solid for both of these there is

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.180 
pretty solid for both of these there is
a<00:02:50.690> version<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.200> these<00:02:51.350> it's<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:51.830> cheaper

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
a version of these it's a little cheaper

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.860 
a version of these it's a little cheaper
that<00:02:52.370> doesn't<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.120> wider<00:02:53.540> black

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that doesn't have the wider black

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.260 
that doesn't have the wider black
powdercoat<00:02:54.350> that's<00:02:54.710> just<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.010> ets<00:02:55.370> t<00:02:55.700> 40<00:02:56.120> we

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
powdercoat that's just the ets t 40 we

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.000 
powdercoat that's just the ets t 40 we
didn't<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.750> those<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.050> test<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.590> if

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
didn't have one of those to test but if

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.350 
didn't have one of those to test but if
you<00:02:58.130> don't<00:02:58.280> care<00:02:58.370> about<00:02:58.490> looks<00:02:58.820> be<00:02:59.090> sure<00:02:59.240> to
