and I just felt awful I had a really a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.860 
and I just felt awful I had a really a
lack<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.280> sense<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.789> control<00:00:50.120> over<00:00:50.239> my<00:00:50.839> body

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.490 
experimenting with different types of
diets<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.239> finding<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:08.989> what<00:02:09.200> worked<00:02:09.409> best

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
diets and finding out what worked best

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
diets and finding out what worked best
for<00:02:09.769> me<00:02:10.009> my<00:02:10.939> cholesterol<00:02:11.239> went<00:02:11.599> up

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
for me my cholesterol went up

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.090 
for me my cholesterol went up
so<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> address<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.620> i<00:02:13.680> met<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
so to address that i met with a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
so to address that i met with a
nutritionist<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.060> had<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.930> only<00:02:16.050> took<00:02:16.230> me<00:02:16.290> three

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
nutritionist I had it only took me three

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.270 
nutritionist I had it only took me three
visits<00:02:17.450> didn't<00:02:18.450> take<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> lot<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.900> time<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
visits didn't take a lot of time but the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.490 
visits didn't take a lot of time but the
results<00:02:20.790> were<00:02:20.940> phenomenal<00:02:21.300> because<00:02:21.900> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
results were phenomenal because I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.200 
results were phenomenal because I
learned<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> structure<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.820> meals

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
learned how to structure my meals

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.120 
learned how to structure my meals
structure<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> was<00:02:25.470> eating<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> daily

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
structure what I was eating on a daily

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.110 
structure what I was eating on a daily
basis<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.780> very<00:02:28.140> helpful<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.120> think

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
basis it was really very helpful I think

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.700 
basis it was really very helpful I think
the<00:02:30.240> biggest<00:02:30.480> challenge<00:02:30.990> has<00:02:31.050> been<00:02:31.230> finding

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
the biggest challenge has been finding

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.780 
the biggest challenge has been finding
new<00:02:31.830> clothes<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:34.010> I've<00:02:35.010> gone<00:02:35.190> through<00:02:35.250> quite<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
new clothes I I've gone through quite a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.120 
new clothes I I've gone through quite a
bit<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.120> new<00:02:36.270> clothing<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.590> biggest

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
bit of new clothing the biggest

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.790 
bit of new clothing the biggest
challenge<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.150> honest<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.840> probably<00:02:41.210> just

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
challenge to be honest is probably just

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.620 
challenge to be honest is probably just
continually<00:02:43.800> doing<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:45.260> cardinal<00:02:46.260> sin<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
continually doing it the cardinal sin of

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.630 
continually doing it the cardinal sin of
putting<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:48.780> weight<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.650> eating<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> meal<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
putting on weight is not eating a meal a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.270 
putting on weight is not eating a meal a
skipping<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> meal<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
skipping a meal so you have to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.560 
skipping a meal so you have to
constantly<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.210> top<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.990> situation

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
constantly be on top of the situation

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.540 
constantly be on top of the situation
every<00:02:57.570> time<00:02:57.840> there<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> meal<00:02:59.340> every

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
every time there there is a meal every

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.730 
every time there there is a meal every
two<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.850> three<00:02:59.970> hours<00:03:00.180> you're<00:03:00.690> eating<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
two to three hours you're eating and you

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.900 
two to three hours you're eating and you
cannot<00:03:02.250> miss<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.610> meal<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> focus

cannot miss a meal now that I focus

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.570 
cannot miss a meal now that I focus
exactly<00:03:06.080> specifically<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.440> getting<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.430> as

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it it drives me constantly so find that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.650 
it it drives me constantly so find that
why<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.340> you'll<00:03:17.970> be<00:03:18.090> able<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.330> reach<00:03:18.540> your

why and you'll be able to reach your

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.170 
why and you'll be able to reach your
goals<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:20.250> honestly<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:21.030> biggest

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
goals really honestly the biggest

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.630 
goals really honestly the biggest
difference<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.950> feel<00:03:23.070> wonderful

and I have a lot of energy to which is

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.250 
and I have a lot of energy to which is
huge<00:03:38.820> when<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.420> first<00:03:39.720> went<00:03:39.959> on<00:03:40.110> the

medications for the epilepsy I was

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.440 
medications for the epilepsy I was
sleeping<00:03:43.170> all<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.320> time<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:45.000> didn't<00:03:45.360> have

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
sleeping all the time and I didn't have

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.990 
sleeping all the time and I didn't have
a<00:03:45.480> diet<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.959> was<00:03:46.170> giving<00:03:46.500> me<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
a diet that was giving me you know the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.120 
a diet that was giving me you know the
energy<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.390> didn't<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.080> training<00:03:49.860> that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
energy I didn't have the training that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.250 
energy I didn't have the training that
was<00:03:50.220> giving<00:03:50.520> me<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> energy<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.540> feel<00:03:52.080> like

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
was giving me the energy so I feel like

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.040 
was giving me the energy so I feel like
a<00:03:52.320> new<00:03:52.530> person<00:03:52.560> really
