 Hello everyone and as you understood in the title 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 under the video of what is at stake and so were not 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.900
 a lot to start 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.540
 let's go first do our layout 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.990
 future saddle we take cardboard dense 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.240
 paper or just white paper 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 We put our bike and we try 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 are planning 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 How she gulkinym they short 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.599
 fat or 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 subtle and flowing around our hands on 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 the very first stage the stage number we select 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.350
 what material will our future be 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.329
 saddle frame material selection can 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
 be plenty what we do next 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.309
 we just take our layout already and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 We apply in our case, we have chosen 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.949
 metal outlines and cut it was 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.170
 number three is mounting hardware when 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 already everything will be a shame will be uncomfortable 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.020
 climb somehow scroll 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.680
 screw and the like therefore 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.140
 bolts and bend welded them already them something on 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.880

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 somehow but so hard so that you don't 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:22.270
 fell fourth component 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.930
 on our design which we can 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.290
 cut out 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.900
 we have already arched apply our little 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.360
 polyurethane foam on our metal 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.160

 You are certainly not an easy one and we are not 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.660
 it is necessary to finish because the rocky network 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.680

 or jeans and if you really want yourself 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.920
