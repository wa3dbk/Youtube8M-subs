 after Saturday's torrential rains 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.950

 general the stage of the day she herself was 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.310
 hectic up to kilometer 423 he 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.320
 there was no doubt 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.000
 giniel de villiers was gone for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.820
 impose and largely even problem at the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.370
 kilometer 423 more than giniel so it's 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.929
 nani roma who finds himself leading to

 peterhansel no problem for petter 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.200
 since rva was anyway to more 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.569
 from one hour in general 2010 to 44 minutes 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.670
 and especially that nasser al attiyah has 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.530
 galley like never before many stops 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.869
 for the qatari who finds himself a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 once again stopped at 4 km 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.829
 of arrival 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.259
 the dakar has seen a turning point today 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.929
 peterhansel finds himself alone solidly 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.549
 in the lead with less than a huge setback 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.549
 an 11th title reaches out to him 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.540
 in the motorcycles of upheaval in 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.700
 this step that hurt david 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.020
 casteu victim of shock with a cow 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.480
 yeah those are things that happen 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.250
 the leader of the general classification loses 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.330
 almost half an hour he suffers from a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.850
 shoulder trauma 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.750
 maybe a dislocation but nothing sure 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.000
 also fall for Lopez to chaleco 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.320
 survivors among the favorites and not 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.640
 less since it is all 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.430
 simply the title holder cyril 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.930
 després and joan barreda no mistake 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.330
 for loans they had time to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.429
 catch up on casteu and whose injury 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.440
 of his rival involuntarily makes the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.209
 casteu business who after his injury 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.580
 experiencing mechanical problems is 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.350
 forced to stop to repair at a 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.450
 thirty kilometers from the finish 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.220
 and to add to the luck of the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 title is a very bad state 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.410
 possible for olivier bread old leader 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.970
 from general to arrival cyril depres y 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.290
 41 minutes and 36 seconds 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.200
 it is more than 4 minutes ahead joan 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.709
 barreda then alessandro botturi and at 7 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.510
 minutes 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.600
 ruben faria and so well the whole problem 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.820
 from the meadows had 13 minutes 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.290
 of delay on faria so this is the

 Portuguese who takes the head of the general
