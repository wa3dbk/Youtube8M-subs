there's<00:01:17.189> no<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> work

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
there's no way we can get it to work

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.990 
there's no way we can get it to work
you've<00:01:19.979> tried<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> things<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> can

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you've tried all the things that you can

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.420 
you've tried all the things that you can
try<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:21.509> only<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:22.020> only

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.560 
try and there's only there's only
certain<00:01:23.430> things<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.939> try<00:01:24.060> anyway

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
certain things that you can try anyway

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
certain things that you can try anyway
and<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> course<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> can't<00:01:26.310> see

and of course I'm not there I can't see

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.830 
and of course I'm not there I can't see
what<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> machine<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> doing<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.540> I've<00:01:27.659> got<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
what the machine is doing but I've got a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
what the machine is doing but I've got a
rough<00:01:28.020> idea<00:01:28.259> he<00:01:29.009> sent<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> log<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> from

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
rough idea he sent me the log and from

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
rough idea he sent me the log and from
all<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.930> research<00:01:31.290> online

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
all I can research online

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.780 
all I can research online
it's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> CPU<00:01:33.329> problem<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.079> assume<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.220> what

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it's a CPU problem so I assume this what

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
it's a CPU problem so I assume this what
I<00:01:35.820> believe<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.600> CPU<00:01:37.140> 2<00:01:37.409> has<00:01:37.740> been<00:01:37.890> damaged<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I believe it's CPU 2 has been damaged in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
I believe it's CPU 2 has been damaged in
some<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.390> transit<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.810> end

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
some kind of way in transit now this end

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
opinion in of no part of the machine

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
anything like that but of course it was

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
anything like that but of course it was
just<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> pure<00:01:52.500> emotion<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.820> Mac<00:01:54.000> Pro<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
just a pure emotion of the Mac Pro in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
just a pure emotion of the Mac Pro in
transit<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.049> completely<00:01:56.030> annihilated<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.149> I
