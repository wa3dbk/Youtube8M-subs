nice-looking<00:00:17.390> like<00:00:17.600> I'm<00:00:18.530> going<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.740> join<00:00:18.980> two

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
nice-looking like I'm going to join two

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:29.660 
nice-looking like I'm going to join two
bases<00:00:19.670> together<00:00:19.850> like<00:00:20.510> two<00:00:20.690> boilers

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.190 

the<00:00:30.300> SCF<00:00:30.660> reason<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.230> disassembled<00:00:32.600> on<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the SCF reason we disassembled on the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.030 
the SCF reason we disassembled on the
ends<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.790> bases<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.910> been<00:00:35.940> cut<00:00:36.210> away<00:00:37.040> but

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
ends of the bases have been cut away but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.180 
ends of the bases have been cut away but
it's<00:00:38.190> joining<00:00:38.520> together<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> mat<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.010> using

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's joining together the mat I'm using

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.439 
it's joining together the mat I'm using
the<00:00:41.370> joining<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.699> bases<00:00:42.030> together<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
the joining the bases together it's

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.000 
the joining the bases together it's
called<00:00:42.540> lunging<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.290> as<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
called lunging and as you can see that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.520 
called lunging and as you can see that
indentation<00:00:44.570> will<00:00:45.570> new<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.870> along<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
indentation will new right along and the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.520 
indentation will new right along and the
other<00:00:46.710> base<00:00:47.280> will<00:00:47.699> sit<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.330> flush<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
other base will sit on that flush I just

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
other base will sit on that flush I just
need<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.769> bit<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> filler<00:00:52.909> machine<00:00:53.909> I'm

using is a earth Lunger primarily using
car<00:00:57.870> body<00:00:58.050> works<00:00:58.290> doing<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> same<00:00:59.159> thing

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
car body works doing the same thing

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.100 
car body works doing the same thing
joining<00:00:59.730> panels<00:01:00.000> together<00:01:00.180> which<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.870> good

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
joining panels together which is a good

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:19.900 
joining panels together which is a good
job<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.500> this

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.570 

the<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:21.150> sc3<00:01:21.840> base<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.620> open<00:01:22.920> spot<00:01:23.190> welded

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the to sc3 base is an open spot welded

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.790 
the to sc3 base is an open spot welded
together<00:01:23.760> on<00:01:24.510> always<00:01:24.870> left<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.260> do<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
together on always left to do now is

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.740 
together on always left to do now is
fill<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> old<00:01:26.340> redundant<00:01:26.910> flour<00:01:27.150> wells

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
fill the old redundant flour wells

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
fill the old redundant flour wells
I<00:01:27.780> put<00:01:28.260> person<00:01:28.620> patch<00:01:28.800> panels<00:01:29.220> again<00:01:29.520> using<00:01:30.510> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I put person patch panels again using a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.100 
I put person patch panels again using a
plunger<00:01:31.640> much<00:01:32.640> needed<00:01:32.940> no<00:01:33.120> just<00:01:33.690> spot<00:01:33.900> weld

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
plunger much needed no just spot weld

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:47.320 
plunger much needed no just spot weld
them<00:01:34.650> together<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.950> easy<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.550> that

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.580 

it's<00:01:48.330> no<00:01:48.510> time<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.960> start<00:01:49.170> looking<00:01:49.440> at<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's no time to start looking at the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.320 
it's no time to start looking at the
design<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.250> engine<00:01:50.310> frames<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> v8

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
design of the engine frames for the v8

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.840 
design of the engine frames for the v8
engine<00:01:51.800> I've<00:01:52.800> decided<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> really

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
engine I've decided that if you really

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.390 
engine I've decided that if you really
even<00:01:54.030> look<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.150> bit<00:01:54.330> off<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> plunge

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
even look a bit off the plunge

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.580 
even look a bit off the plunge
you<00:01:56.400> can<00:01:56.610> gets<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.850> nice<00:01:57.030> V<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:58.229> workable

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can gets a nice V that's workable

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
you can gets a nice V that's workable
and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.640> both<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> frames<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.600> same

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and then be both the frames on the same

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
and then be both the frames on the same
plane<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.560> gonna<00:02:01.740> sit<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.190> carriage

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
plane are gonna sit on this carriage

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
plane are gonna sit on this carriage
I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.360> carriage<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> leveler

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
I think this carriage is like a leveler

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
I think this carriage is like a leveler
I<00:02:04.710> need<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> finish<00:02:05.190> out<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> lot<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.180> look<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
I need to finish out a lot to look it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.640 
I need to finish out a lot to look it
and<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.810> look<00:02:06.930> more<00:02:06.990> attractive

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and make it look more attractive

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.380 
and make it look more attractive
I've<00:02:08.130> already<00:02:08.280> started<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
I've already started on this one as you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.300 
I've already started on this one as you
can<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.570> i<00:02:09.899> relieved<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.649> quarter<00:02:11.009> inch<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
can see i relieved a quarter inch of it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.770 
can see i relieved a quarter inch of it
much<00:02:14.310> much<00:02:14.580> better<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.120> still<00:02:15.300> needs<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.660> lot

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
much much better but still needs a lot

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.520 
much much better but still needs a lot

big<00:05:52.210> enough<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.600> power<00:05:52.810> bloody<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.169> lot<00:05:53.350> more<00:05:53.590> is

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
big enough to power bloody a lot more is
