00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.269
 you everybody his reptile nuptials on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 is found for a new video so 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 a short video story of you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 show the new decor of the fact that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 cerium of this quarter is to show you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 a nice little system when like 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 I have not planned water filtration 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.470
 at fund level bin Behold the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.699
 he sleeps them quietly 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.710
 so at the level of decoration so I 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.369
 pink as you can see handle 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 also the branches 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.690
 I added some and still have some margin to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.520
 this level 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 so of course I'm doing little by little 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 like that the plants grow up 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 plants from the fund she grows small to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 small and manage rising every time the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 branches and I add new ones 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 plants every time you that the decor 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 is getting better and better so here it is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 it's a little dull colors this 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.809
 that he had he was cold right now 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.590
 it is not very hot 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
 so here is the decor below there is a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.210
 plant that is alas will turn off kahina 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.220
 may 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.799
 she died so I think of a water to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.190
 an incompatibility at the level of 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.830
 plants 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 but I also think he was very 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.750
 tight at the fence in the corner 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.190
 she had not much light but 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.930
 otherwise all the others grow very 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.430
 well 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.330
 here is the background there is a bit of clouds so 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.240
 you see the bottom is a little 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.070
 scary and there are ball colonists who get 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.509
 develop if I'm wrong that's it 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.009
 no 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.159
 so that's it's these are small animals 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.660
 which degrades the organic matter of 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.700
 funds that recycle all that 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.340
 so that's fine it creates 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 a little world fauna sighs a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.729
 recycling system 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.810
 So here small system when too 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.640
 back at the bottom tray it's 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 a bottle that I drilled game them 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.300
 push in the substrate to the bottom 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.619
 and I inserted a small pump 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.310
 so I'm going to show you this to more than 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.789
 details we do not see very well in 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 big is a little pump the pipe 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.060
 part of 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.320
 and he goes in another big bottle 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.440
 to recycle water otherwise as a plant 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.090
 I added a post what I put 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.560
 in order to ski during and to garnish 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.120
 a little bit above and I added a 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.010
 deer horn fern it's like that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.320
 so that's called for good 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.760
 hang the branches together and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.890
 your cerium flex for easter and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.810
 risks with your chameleon so there is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.020
 a technique is very simple 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.850
 punch holes in the branches and 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.070
 as well to pass launched risks like 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.700
 it's called or necklaces things 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.010
 plastic and balls and the tip that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.310
 you cut because it can be a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.720
 little edge for your truck 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.350
 so that's fine that allows that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.320
 you see the branches either nas is 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.370
 well hung between them so we can 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.370
 hide the white sweetbreads 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
 Here some clashes between them 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.280
 so here for the decor so I think 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.730
 add other plants of course 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.330
 I think even turbo is also 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.970
 add a lot of branches 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.680
 history that the cage the protection 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.850
 touch totally above 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.390
 so there is still 30 cm still put 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.120
 fine bark of cork with 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.350
 hang tillandsia I really 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.350
 found some good stuff 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.480
 why not put it so here is my 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.590
 chameleon is doing very well he still has his 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.540
 problem with the language 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.630
 I really think it 's 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.380
 birth but that does not prevent to live 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.380
 and to feed 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.709
 so here it was a little video 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.390
 story to show you a little the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.160
 new decor and talk to you a little bit of 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.620
