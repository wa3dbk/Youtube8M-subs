00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.720
 and wrapped of bolivia with a performance 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.190
 very good they hurt towards peace 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.559
 tell us how was the experience of 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.070
 replayability in the selection looks 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.710
 happy and happy because good is a son 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.720
 targets the challenges out there 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.700
 any player wants to have one could 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.840
 to be able to be and the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.250
 true that good an experience 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.170
 different from all the others because good 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.610
 because we know what height this you 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.010
 will also ask how was played in 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.449
 the height which ones are let's say more 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.430
 beyond what you know the differences 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.379
 to play for example here in the field that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.269
 in argentina it is not a different 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.710
 true that living with a voice in 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.920
 how much because good because the air is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.050
 different 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.659
 the headache also occurs in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.019
 efforts is a feeling that does not 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.250
 We are used to it, but I think 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.260
 that we are ready too 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 physically as for as to compete 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.809
 well a little too think about where 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.219
 these plays are also playing you 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.049
 motivates more so a little leave this from 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.059
 side we saw some that were put 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.640
 oxygen you had that also resorted 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 to that resource or you could go easy on 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.509
 the oxygen that it generated changed the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.490
 air the truth that you regenerated a 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.619
 little is something that we also did in 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.940
 the costumes for good in some 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.429
 moments that we felt a little 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.929
 drowned and I think it was something also in 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.450
 positive because not because there are also 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.039
 other formulas at the same time we arrived on 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 the time of the game we were not there long 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.209
 time in height and those two formulas 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 in that they expand to play this type 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.979
 of party not good all things that I think 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 that are positive and how they can play 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 with messi that is the best in the world as 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 play next to him on a court 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.600
 the best thing that exists is a player who 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.850
 It gives pleasure to see him pleasure to play next 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 of him and good as we say all for 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.360
 luck is Argentine and the truth is 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.590
 also admired person is a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.119
 very simple person a person who 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.070
 that is also very much involved in 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.799
 group and that's good to have good 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.390
 entered yesterday gives you as an illusion of 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.979
 Well, there are chances to follow 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.799
 playing the national team and being able to get 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.630
 to the global yes the truth that is a group 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.660
 which is already formed his group will 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 getting into people is in the position in the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.260
 which one you play there are many players of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.640
 high hierarchy and then you have to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.830
 keep a level in rivers I think that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.209
 in the club where one was not because 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.590
 the calls out there are from every 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.569
 two or three months you have to maintain a 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 level and with that level surely 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.110
 we will continue trying to make think about 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.849
 coach yes yes you can have it in 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.410
 account and how was the memory with your 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.690
 teammates after several days without 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.020
 come here to train but good for 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 Of course I am telling what was one 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.440
 and well then always one talks to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.270
 the companions when it is out of the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.730
 that he had been doing and wanting to 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.110
 come back because the truth that I feel 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.150
 very comfortable and good and try to 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.950
 mentalizing has already happened today this 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.440
 regenerative works and already tomorrow 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.850
 back to normal we were a 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 little because the flight was delayed 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.200
 we came late and decided to do 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.730
 a little regenerative and tomorrow back 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.050
 with the group and how it prepares the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.240
 match with vÃ©lez is a match that goes to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.310
 to be very cute very expected is a match 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.860
 cute is a game that we have the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.870
 eager to reverse the last game 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.580
 against it the image was not good 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.980
 I'm sorry to win to keep fighting 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.940
 up and good a match that really 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.010
 have surely I have to be more 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.390
 100% because it is difficult opponents more 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.710
 I imagine that wanting to continue walking 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.540
 in the monumental that we come from streak 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.920
 but of course of riding has to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.750
 continue to be strong with our 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 people and good to give to the idea these people 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.230
 that really deserves more than good 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.580
 of what we are to us pretend 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.260
 to delude people through power 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.040
 get to the end of the tournament fighting and 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.040
 well what we want
