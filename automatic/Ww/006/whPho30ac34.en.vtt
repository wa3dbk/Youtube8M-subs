00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.010
 what happened imagine what they capture you and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.600
 after you have a plan 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.890
 escape at the moment of executing 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.890
 that something like that happens 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.580
 betrayed by your own motorcycle 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.179
 and I said that you have to have a lot 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 bad luck for you at a time that 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.179
 you need all the functions but 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179
 go running without you 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.100
 and you noticed who was 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 putting a group of police officers that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.670
 they had arrested but this video is the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 use so he owns russia this video me 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.150
 suggests that the reason why 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.410
 they had stopped to make it a bit 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.090
 different gentleman you have been 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.800
 had we determined that your level of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 alcohol is too low to handle it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.930
 missing a bottle and half the pot if I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930
 they catch 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.780
 and from experience of life I can 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.310
 ensure that before everything happened 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 that the motorcycle did not even want 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.550
 turn on but on which the white of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
 this recording and your weird cameraman does not 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.890
 it's okay to say they put down 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.890
 a chicken 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.000
 and I thinking that I was the only one who had 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.650
 a hen of a cameraman 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.330
 In my life I have seen many kinds of 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.100
 people doing all kinds of tricks and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.740
 bike stunts now what 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:02:02.200
 comes next is totally 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:02:04.450
 awesome and after the show 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.130
 he steals the bicycle to the bed I am 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.180
 kidding but you know the guy 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.180
 he has talent for that 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.749
 and as I understand it as well as 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.159
 he conquered girls in Africa like this 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 how on this side of the world did they get 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.280
 located in line with what 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 appears but I really believe that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.310
 this guy like he likes to entertain 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.049
 people hear I want to see the trick that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.500
 I learned how to make a loan bicycle 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:33.870
 yours to teach and after 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.250
 wake up knowing the bicycle no longer 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.169
 seriously but I do believe that I believe that the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.969
 bicycle was not even a bone look 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.799
 at the end of the video he puts the bicycle 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.419
 and he's walking away from me when he was 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.950
 walking around there he saw the bicycle you 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.879
 I say again it 's a show and you 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.959
 you want to know what would be a good 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.760
 news that at the end of both 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.630
 show and both the guy did not even 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.270
 let's know, this bicycle 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.950
 cast 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.390
 because you know that I show you here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.860
 all kinds of animals such as for example 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.480
 they have complex of people who 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.310
 they want water what they move to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.320
 themselves what you want to fly away that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.430
 they want to sing to me is the political thing and the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 today I am going to add a new 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.320
 category what is believed is military 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.880
 they come out to warm up 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.360
 for 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.780
 but the chain 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.670
 ah 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.900
 I had to what I tell you to see me 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.580
 is scary the way you 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.050
 anima is advancing from here to 200 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.209
 years we do not do well at the zoo 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.010
 and it ends up dominating the human I know that 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.360
 we found a good solution for this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.160
 let's eat it all and you know that I 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.360
 I'm a lot more people over it 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.830
 say that this support more unless 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.330
 eight of them even if it was walking from 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.860
 cock I would say that he has to have some 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.060
 standing on the feet or that's how I do 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.770

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.760
 member and how are you going to see it I do not know if 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.560

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.209
 claim of civilians now so with more 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.750
 reason and I like it is that it came out we fought 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.130
 how is not everything 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.480

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.100
 introduction for each click that I'm going to 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.690
