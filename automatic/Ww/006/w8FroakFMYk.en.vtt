00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:47.570 
particularly for time trial or anything
but<00:04:41.389> I<00:04:45.050> think<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.830> TC<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.430> in

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
but I think it's just on TC like in

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.219 
but I think it's just on TC like in
general<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.030> more<00:04:48.210> time<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.630> can<00:04:48.750> spend<00:04:48.930> on

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
general the more time you can spend on

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.800 
general the more time you can spend on
it<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.310> more<00:04:51.000> comfortable<00:04:51.240> you're<00:04:51.600> going<00:04:51.720> to

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
it the more comfortable you're going to

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.740 
it the more comfortable you're going to
be<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.139> position

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750
