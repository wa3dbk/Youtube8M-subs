00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.752
Today is the day to accelerate a Stuttgart jewelry

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.068
The A 45 AMG

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.360
The most powerful 2.0 engine of the world

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.800
What you expect from this car, Rubinho?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.640
I've always been so passionate for the AMG line

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.480
The cars are very powerful, have a lot of stability

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.460
It's a car... It's a jewelry of course

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.560
To test in a track like this, I think this one will be in front

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.875
4WD should make some difference

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.860
Let's try?

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.420
Let's go!

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.780
So, here we go

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.620
Velo CittÃ 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
This A 45 should be a great pleasure to drive

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.140
Because is an engine very small but very powerful

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.840
Here we have the electronics that we can let on to have intelligent traction

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.060
Or turn off to be just with the rear traction

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.220
The driver will always prefer the rear traction

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.380
But the 4WD is faster than the rear traction, isn't?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
Well, we need to see how much will reduce the power

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.080
You have moments that you would like to turn off, exiting the corner

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.960
Is a moment that you are losing time

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.060
Now the torque of this car is amazing for what I see

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.340
With low rpm the car is so strong

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.660
Yeah, let's say to or public that we are slow for the guys taking pictures

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.060
This is hurting me

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.000
Now that you said that you are tired to be so slow, let's do a fast lap?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.420
Just to feel this car a bit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.640
You are going into the kerbs in the morning like this, Rubinho

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.800
My breakfast will come back here

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020
This car turns in very well

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.360
Don't go wide 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.220
So drop me in the finish line

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.300
So, go flat out reaching the limit of this car

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.560
Hey production, let's turn off this radio, huh?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860
Let's go, Rubinho. Let's push.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.840
'Fast Lap with Rubens Barrichello'

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.400
Now it's time!

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.920
I liked this turn

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.720
Go!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.620
With the help of the 4WD and with the good torque of the turbo

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.540
The A 45 AMG did 1 min 5 sec and 23

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.020
One tenth of a second more faster than the M135i

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.980
But this fight will continue 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.500
Very good car, so stable

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.720
I don't have too much hair to arrange, but ok

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.460
This car have the characteristic to understeers a bit

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.560
Which is safe for the streets

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.140
Despite, when you lift the throttle it corrects

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.220
When oversteers you lift the throttle and he can spin
