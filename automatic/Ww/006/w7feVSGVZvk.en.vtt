maps because it was always white but I

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.310 
maps because it was always white but I
don't<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.180> why<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:15.750> remember<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.290> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
in my fp6 and I'm getting a little bit

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.660 
in my fp6 and I'm getting a little bit
scared<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.860> again<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.100> had<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.549> this

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
scared so again I had to think of this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.240 
scared so again I had to think of this
SC<00:03:33.030> 2010<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.260> far<00:03:34.440> i<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.739> i<00:03:34.830> have<00:03:34.860> three

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250

SC 2010 and so far i think i have three
kills<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.640> SC<00:03:35.910> 2010<00:03:36.330> i<00:03:36.420> fast-forward<00:03:37.110> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
kills of SC 2010 i fast-forward this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
kills of SC 2010 i fast-forward this
part<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.890> little<00:03:38.100> bit<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:38.790> i

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
part just a little bit just because i

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.009 
part just a little bit just because i
don't<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.390> want<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> bore<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.870> guys
