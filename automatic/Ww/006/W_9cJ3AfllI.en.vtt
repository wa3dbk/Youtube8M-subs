 flow series to that thread 4 and just 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.750

 good in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 talk about a topic that he did caused 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 quite a stir among the community 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.030
 gamer especially people who do 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.550
 videos that was that 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.629
 who found a post where they indicated 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.079
 that microsoft studios and studio for three 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.160
 and 343 they were not going to allow making videos 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 leave it 4 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.130
 well that is the post is real 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.670
 I will 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.080
 I will leave the links of the original post 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.520
 down in the description of the video the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.110
 first link that was not found 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.380
 it rested original where said 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.380
 information 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.860
 good what happens with this information 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.220
 this law or clause is in force from 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 the output of halo reach from before 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.259
 the output of halo reach and has always 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.759
 been alone that right now people 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 poking around in the community forum of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 halo discovered it and caused quite 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 stir creating false information 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.369
 that we were not going to be able to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.850
 Serbs let him four what else and that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.850
 Sirs 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.510
 question that a part is true but 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 on the other hand it is wrong that 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.610
 like all video games hello has 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.190
 a copyright a copyright 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.340
 which forbids you to do certain things 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.380
 with the game in which that post or 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.360
 answer that there is in that topic of that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.600
 of the forum that thread 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.540
 is that if you make a hello video and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.160
 it tells you that you are a creator of that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.460
 game or do you have some kind of right 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 about that game your videos will be given 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.720
 low and there is a high possibility of 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.110
 that your YouTube channel be given a 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.110
 strike 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.550
 as I said because of the bad 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.280
 interpretation 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.280
 this post was created that rumor was created 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.790
 I think two days ago 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.049
 yesterday in two days 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.090
 a person from microsoft studio made 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.160
 an explanation of this clause 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.590
 in which I will also leave the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.190
 link to that answer 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.350
 all those links are in English 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.730
 If you do not know English, I'm going to make a 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.860
 small network 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.830
 with a little summary of what I did the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.670
 post that came out a few days ago in which 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.769
 the person clarifies that this is a 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.530
 clause against what they always call 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.900
 I mentioned previously that it was prevent 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.739
 that people make money saying that the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.180
 game is yours on the other hand they do not go 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.240
 to have a lot of people 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 chasing people who upload videos 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.080
 to demonstrate their skills 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.210
 it was like this the people who 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.220
 has no partnership with any network 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.190
 of video games 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.570
 and then mentioned since they from 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.980
 years ago they have mainly 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.200
 deals with matxin and more as we can 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.920
 see in the realization of the hey series 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.360
 they have a partnership is special not 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.840
 how do you have electronic to battlefield 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.490
 rather it has battlefield towards 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.230
 playstation as you have it also that 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.180
 have studies with microsoft and like that but 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.000
 they also had other agreements 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.440
 with most of the networks 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.140
 video game 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.660
 what does this mean all the rumors 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.420
 that they made that the channels that 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.040
 upload contents of hello 4 ivÃ¡n 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.740
 they were going to add strike if they go to 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.890
 shut down the videos were going to fall 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.440
 are totally false this was due to the 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.390
 misinterpretation 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.440
 a clause 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.440
 of the study 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.509
 so from my channel they can 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.590
 wait for the contents of the four 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.830
 as soon as I leave, I will continue with this 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.470
 countdown series to 4 without any 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 kind of problems over there I saw that I think 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.410
 that 10 Mayer 360 also commented on 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.479
 this topic is that perfect made a video 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 saying that if it's going to be a channel 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.130
 secondary to climb halo 4 and I'll 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.539
 I said it was not necessary I explained 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.599
 everything that I am telling you here in 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.789
 this video and well I will see what 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.740
 people who also have a channel and have 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.449
 this doubt will be clarified to the extent 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.110
 as possible 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:19.500
 well that was the theme of this episode 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.910
 episode number 2 23 days remain for the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.250
 exit of the game 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.190
 and from this side to the monitor I talk to you about 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.230
 excessive jp and see you next 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.200
 video editing or whatever it is that you do 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.690
 always about 30 seconds left or a 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.900
 minute is not going to continue running without 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.900
 no music and that's all
