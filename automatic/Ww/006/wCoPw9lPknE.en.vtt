so<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.449> way<00:03:21.629> we<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.810> which<00:03:22.079> one<00:03:22.229> it<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.409> ok

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
so that way we know which one it is ok

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.000 
so that way we know which one it is ok
ok<00:03:23.510> once<00:03:24.510> you've<00:03:24.690> got<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.290> exported<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:25.979> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
ok once you've got this it exported as a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.589 
ok once you've got this it exported as a
schematic<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.819> only<00:03:27.060> thing<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.329> really<00:03:27.479> have

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
schematic the only thing you really have

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.939 
schematic the only thing you really have
to<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.229> go<00:03:28.379> into<00:03:28.769> nbt<00:03:29.549> edit<00:03:29.909> file<00:03:30.949> open

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
to do is you go into nbt edit file open

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.800 
to do is you go into nbt edit file open
and<00:03:32.120> you're<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.299> want<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.479> go<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.659> your

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and you're going to want to go to your

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.930 
and you're going to want to go to your
emcee<00:03:34.199> at<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.440> filed<00:03:34.680> your<00:03:34.829> mcedit<00:03:35.400> schematics

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
emcee at it filed your mcedit schematics

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.729 
emcee at it filed your mcedit schematics
and<00:03:36.090> open<00:03:36.419> up<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> schematic<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.500> saved

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and open up the schematic you just saved

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.979 
and open up the schematic you just saved
ok<00:03:38.069> what<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.489> going<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.699> do<00:03:38.849> is<00:03:39.389> this<00:03:39.750> is

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
ok what this is going to do is this is

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.960 
ok what this is going to do is this is
going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> well<00:03:40.919> apparently<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.489> didn't<00:03:41.729> select

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to well apparently I didn't select

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.219 
going to well apparently I didn't select
it<00:03:42.150> right<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:42.479> this<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> bring<00:03:43.079> it

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
up to where you've got the two entities

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.349 
up to where you've got the two entities
there<00:03:47.159> let<00:03:47.760> me<00:03:47.819> open<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> different

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
there let me open up a different

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.909 
there let me open up a different
schematic<00:03:49.019> here<00:03:49.049> where<00:03:49.349> I've<00:03:49.440> actually<00:03:49.620> got

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
schematic here where I've actually got

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.319 
schematic here where I've actually got
the<00:03:50.069> entities<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.790> open<00:03:51.690> up<00:03:52.549> hey<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:54.030> dream

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
the entities I open up hey it's a dream

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.559 
the entities I open up hey it's a dream
schematic<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.040> same<00:03:56.220> thing<00:03:56.269> ok<00:03:57.269> where

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
schematic it's the same thing ok where

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.119 
schematic it's the same thing ok where
it<00:03:57.659> says<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:57.900> where<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.379> says<00:03:58.409> entities<00:03:58.979> this

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
it says here where it says entities this

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.460 
it says here where it says entities this
is<00:03:59.280> two<00:03:59.459> entities<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.150> type<00:04:00.389> you're<00:04:01.290> going<00:04:01.409> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
is two entities of type you're going to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.439 
is two entities of type you're going to
want<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.620> expand<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.310> ok<00:04:02.760> you'll<00:04:02.909> see<00:04:03.090> two<00:04:03.299> of

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
want to expand that ok you'll see two of

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.170 
want to expand that ok you'll see two of
these<00:04:03.540> ok<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.439> your<00:04:04.590> entity<00:04:05.129> thing<00:04:05.970> this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
these ok this is your entity thing this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.059 
these ok this is your entity thing this
is<00:04:06.359> what<00:04:06.659> makes<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.049> horse<00:04:07.229> you<00:04:07.409> know<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.769> horse
