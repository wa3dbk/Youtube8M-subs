warfare 3 today and I've been playing

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.259 
warfare 3 today and I've been playing
quite<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> lot<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> infected<00:00:26.730> lately<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.179> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
quite a lot of infected lately it's a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.960 
quite a lot of infected lately it's a
really<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:28.560> good<00:00:28.830> game<00:00:29.039> game<00:00:29.789> mode

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
really really pretty good game game mode

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.210 
really really pretty good game game mode
but<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.140> quite<00:00:31.349> disappointed<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:32.040> they've

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
but I was quite disappointed how they've

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.280 
but I was quite disappointed how they've
removed<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.970> drop<00:00:33.150> zone<00:00:33.420> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
removed it for drop zone because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
removed it for drop zone because
everyone<00:00:35.160> used<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> play<00:00:35.610> drop<00:00:35.970> zone<00:00:36.180> 4

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
everyone used to play drop zone 4

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.830 
everyone used to play drop zone 4
montage<00:00:37.380> clips<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.280> killfeeds<00:00:39.000> using

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
montage clips and killfeeds using

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.300 
montage clips and killfeeds using
snipers<00:00:40.260> obviously<00:00:40.650> it's<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.130> good<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
snipers obviously it's really good to

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.030 
snipers obviously it's really good to
forget<00:00:41.550> feeds<00:00:42.140> whereas<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.320> game<00:00:43.590> mode<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
forget feeds whereas this game mode you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
forget feeds whereas this game mode you
can't<00:00:44.310> really<00:00:44.490> get<00:00:44.730> any<00:00:45.270> clips<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.530> anything

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
can't really get any clips or anything

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.390 
can't really get any clips or anything
because<00:00:47.360> it's<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.650> because<00:00:49.650> it's<00:00:49.680> evolved

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
because it's just because it's evolved

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.000 
because it's just because it's evolved
from<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.670> private<00:00:51.030> match<00:00:51.180> game<00:00:51.450> mode<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:52.770> can't

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
from a private match game mode you can't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
from a private match game mode you can't
really<00:00:53.220> get<00:00:53.460> clips<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.630> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
really get clips on it and that you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.360 
really get clips on it and that you
could<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.620> montage<00:00:55.980> without<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
could use in a montage without it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930 
could use in a montage without it
looking<00:00:56.490> looking<00:00:57.150> set<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.570> anything<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:58.940> lot

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
looking looking set up or anything a lot

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
looking looking set up or anything a lot
of<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.600> maps<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.040> spots<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of the maps a lot of the spots on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
of the maps a lot of the spots on
infected<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.300> people<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.900> private

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
infected that people use on private

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.130 
infected that people use on private
matches<00:01:04.430> have<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.640> been<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.810> used

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
matches have now been like this used

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.490 
matches have now been like this used
because<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:08.190> fact<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.570> throwing

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because the fact that they get throwing

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400 
because the fact that they get throwing
knives<00:01:10.680> quite<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.290> to

and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> could<00:02:25.379> see<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.400> work<00:02:26.430> very

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and I could see that it would work very

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.809 
and I could see that it would work very
very<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:27.329> online<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.920> getting<00:02:29.159> XP<00:02:29.579> and

very well online with getting XP and

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.949 
very well online with getting XP and
it'd<00:02:29.909> be<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> great<00:02:30.239> way<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.569> level<00:02:30.810> up

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
it'd be a great way to level up

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.020 
it'd be a great way to level up
especially<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:31.890> you're<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.190> juggernaut<00:02:35.030> also

to know if it's any good if I could use
it<00:02:50.569> by<00:02:51.569> obviously<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.440> don't<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.829> because

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
it by obviously but I don't know because

and for all you ps3 guys waiting for the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.000 
and for all you ps3 guys waiting for the
maps<00:02:58.709> well<00:02:59.400> ps3<00:02:59.940> elite<00:03:00.150> members<00:03:00.450> anyway<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
maps well ps3 elite members anyway I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.410 
maps well ps3 elite members anyway I
think<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.609> maps<00:03:02.790> come<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.329> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
think the maps come out on the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.259 
think the maps come out on the
twenty-eighth<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.170> februari<00:03:05.150> correct<00:03:06.150> me<00:03:06.209> if

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
twenty-eighth of februari correct me if

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.309 
twenty-eighth of februari correct me if
I'm<00:03:06.480> wrong<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.379> think<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:07.799> do<00:03:07.859> and

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
I'm wrong but I think they do and

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.649 
I'm wrong but I think they do and
hopefully<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:11.459> means<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:12.000> map<00:03:12.120> packs<00:03:12.359> for

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
hopefully that means the map packs for

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.809 
hopefully that means the map packs for
non<00:03:13.290> cod<00:03:13.560> elite<00:03:13.680> members<00:03:14.159> will<00:03:14.340> be<00:03:14.430> coming<00:03:14.639> out

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
non cod elite members will be coming out

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.390 
non cod elite members will be coming out
probably<00:03:15.629> around<00:03:15.720> March<00:03:16.139> time<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:17.069> some

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
probably around March time or some

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.360 
probably around March time or some
someone<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:19.859> see<00:03:20.069> now<00:03:20.220> on

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
someone like that as you can see now on

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.819 
someone like that as you can see now on
the<00:03:20.430> gameplay<00:03:20.879> me<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.209> James<00:03:21.449> just<00:03:22.440> camping

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829

the enemies just running around i'll

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.789 
the enemies just running around i'll
probably<00:03:27.120> speed<00:03:27.449> this<00:03:27.599> up<00:03:27.810> until<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.650> gets

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
probably speed this up until it gets
