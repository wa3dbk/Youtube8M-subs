00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.520
 driving the alpha 4c is always an experience 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.880
 beautiful if then a cabrio is still 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.040
 better 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.500
 we are on the alp tramping track 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.500
 this in the new 4c spider 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.470
 the first thing you notice is that 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.390
 no longer in the windshield 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.550
 built of aluminum but in carbon in 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.250
 visible carbon fiber has always remained 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.980
 under the fateful 1000 kg starting from 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.980
 a base of 895 kilos was not difficult 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.309
 the bed as we have seen is removed 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.830
 in a few minutes and it's completely 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.379
 of canvas and finds place in a special one 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.850
 bag in the trunk naturally has it 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.320
 luggage space in this case 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.450
 becomes practically zero 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 the best thing you know is what it is and what it is 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.140
 completely changed the sound of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.449
 this car already with the exhausts 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.640
 sports the 4th c coupe had a sound 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.979
 wonderful a symphony from the drains 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 but with the spider even better because the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.530
 sound has inside from the roof that wraps 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 completely 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.240
 at the slightest provocation he answers with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.940
 an absolutely baritone voice 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.060
 exciting moves between a curve and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.200
 the other with an extraordinary activity 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.549
 extraordinary even if we consider that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 contact with the road is not 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.840
 immediate practically nothing and the 4c 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.280
 it does not have power steering and therefore it is not there 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.130
 nothing between my hands and the front wheels 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 certain sensitivity this penalizes a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.640
 little in maneuver is actually really 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.409
 heavy to turn when in 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.930
 parking but just move slightly 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.420
 the wheels to feel it immediately 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.130
 steering that lightens a steering wheel a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.380
 variable ratio that instead becomes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.759
 perfect when it starts 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.860
 speed up the comment in which you are 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.870
 begins to push hard 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.180
 and as we said with the spider 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.530
 the experience is even more exciting 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.990
 because you can hear all the noise of the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 engine the feeling of the rear end that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.430
 faithfully follows the front and one 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.800
 machine quite difficult to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.869
 to govern in the sense that not having the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.290
 third sample has margins so 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.090
 high so when the recovery starts 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.220
 it is not the easiest because it is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.140
 steering is very complicated and therefore 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.930
 it would be necessary to give a lot of flying angle 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.860
 in a very short time 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.450
 on the other hand to the mission of one 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.550
 spider is not to always be 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 totally meeting stefano with this one 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.670
 car you can drive too 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.080
 quietly there are four 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.570
 DNA positions 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.459
 in this case the most extreme one with 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.110
 which we are driving now is the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.420
 race position and that without i 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.220
 check and come push it and throw it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 inside in the curves with the maximum 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.600
 speed and causing even a little 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 so much is known that the braking that this 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.160
 machine we saw it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.290
 a road and an event of a 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.570
 extraordinary power and takes you in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.120
 safety at the entrance to the curve for 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.110
 being able to give the front wheels and follow 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.450
 perfectly 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.110
 history 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.520
 the 1750 turbo engine is always one 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 very pleasant surprise 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.560
 horses are 240 this figure has been 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.050
 a little object of criticism because the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.970
 chassis of this car are 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.400
 finally available to be 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.360
 scrambled that seems quietly 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.360
 being able to support them 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.650
 horses and I assure you they are more than that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.880
 enough to have fun 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.100
 because they stimulate 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.570
 mobile with a power to weight ratio from 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.260
 record its category 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.610
 she certainly does not lack acceleration 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.870
 let alone the green on the road 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.760
 the six-speed dual-clutch gearbox 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.760
 no of the best they ever are 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.060
 especially when using it in mode 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.670
 race only sometimes coming under 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 curve a little bit with confidence 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.629
 a march that may not be 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.909
 inserted however it brings us very well 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.650
 this engine is also out of speed and all of them 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.139
 driving impressions of 4c 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.670
 wrong with the sports file and 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.670
 cabrio with four wheels 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.920
 no 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.630
 to
