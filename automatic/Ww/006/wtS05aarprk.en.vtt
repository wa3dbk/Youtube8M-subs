00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
understanding which is also juxtaposed

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.400 
understanding which is also juxtaposed
by<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.820> tension<00:02:24.120> from<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> fact<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.080> he

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
by the the tension from the fact that he

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.520 
by the the tension from the fact that he
is<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.600> outside<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> school

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.560 
is really on the outside of the school
and<00:02:28.830> whether<00:02:28.980> she<00:02:29.250> wants<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> let<00:02:29.820> herself<00:02:30.000> go

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
and whether she wants to let herself go

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.190 
and whether she wants to let herself go
into<00:02:31.020> something<00:02:31.950> that's<00:02:32.210> really<00:02:33.210> dark<00:02:33.540> which

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
into something that's really dark which

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
into something that's really dark which
is<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.590> potentially<00:02:35.310> dangerous<00:02:35.460> as<00:02:35.910> well

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is and potentially dangerous as well

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.630 
is and potentially dangerous as well
because<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> how<00:02:37.020> much<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.500> threat<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
because this is how much of a threat the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.670 
because this is how much of a threat the
Strigoi<00:02:38.910> are<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.660> literally<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.290> worst

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
Strigoi are it literally is the worst

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
Strigoi are it literally is the worst
thing<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.490> do<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.000> they<00:02:42.150> are<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
thing that you can do and they are the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
thing that you can do and they are the
biggest<00:02:42.960> threat<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.500> our<00:02:43.590> world<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:45.540> well

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
biggest threat in our world so as well

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.540 
biggest threat in our world so as well
as<00:02:45.930> being<00:02:46.080> isolated<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.740> segregated<00:02:46.980> through

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
as being isolated and segregated through

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.330 
as being isolated and segregated through
school<00:02:47.850> he<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.840> seen<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> threat<00:02:49.890> he's<00:02:50.130> seen

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
school he is seen as a threat he's seen

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.430 
school he is seen as a threat he's seen
as<00:02:50.490> dangerous<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.210> obviously<00:02:51.720> Lissa<00:02:51.990> has<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
as dangerous so obviously Lissa has to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
as dangerous so obviously Lissa has to
kind<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.190> battle<00:02:53.550> with<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:53.910> her<00:02:54.000> own<00:02:54.150> head

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
kind of battle with that in her own head

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.630 
kind of battle with that in her own head
of<00:02:54.540> whether<00:02:54.870> she<00:02:55.080> wants<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.460> touched

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
me about that aspect as well I guess for

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580 
me about that aspect as well I guess for
our<00:03:11.370> characters<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.540> feeling<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.110> being<00:03:13.350> on

always go through and that's something

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.990 
always go through and that's something
