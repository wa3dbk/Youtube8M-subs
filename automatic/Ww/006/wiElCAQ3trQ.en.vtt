00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.563
Saint Geoorge killed the dragon

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.874
I want to kill him too

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.505
With my shield, armor

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.721
And spear raised in the air

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:31.239
Saint Geoorge killed the dragon

00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:33.595

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:35.991
With my shield, armor

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.360
And spear raised in the air

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:33.377
This world has so much iniquity

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:38.767
I want to be a knight of the goodness

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:42.952
Always fighting the good combat

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:48.062
With justice, love and loyalty

00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:52.925
I will not bend to any emperor

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.576
And I will not deny what I believe and what I am

00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.223
Following the example of George, the soldier

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.094
The saint, the warrior, the faith by my side

00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:11.510
In perpetual seek for the truth

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.070
Fighting against the dragon of evil

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:21.526
For I know I will smash him

00:02:22.448 --> 00:02:26.319
Under the saints hooves of my horse

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:30.979
For I know I will smash him

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:35.855
Under the saints hooves of my horse

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:40.219

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:44.601
Under the saints hooves of my horse

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.293
Help me, my Saint George!

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:58.925
My flag has a cross
My flag is full of light

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.769
Save George, he´s good!

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.913
Glorious Saint George, in the name of God,

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:12.363
Give me your shield and your powerful weapons,

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.606
Defend me with your force and your greatness,

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:18.956
And underneath the legs of your faithful horse

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:22.685
My enemies stay humble and weak

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.366
Hail, glorious Saint George
Of the celestial fields

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:39.125
Bless your children
With fraternal goodness

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:57.203
Ogan play for Ogum

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:26.178
Ogan play for Ogum, I want to hear
Ogan play for Ogum, I´m gonna ask for

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:35.266
Hoisted flag is signal of a victory
In the fields of Humaitá

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:41.515
And in umbanda we´re all gonna greet
The great phalanx that knows how to fight
