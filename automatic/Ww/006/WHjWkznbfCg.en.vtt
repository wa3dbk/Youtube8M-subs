00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.059
 It is a utility that will be able to 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 allow to retrieve information from 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.770
 our hard drive or recover a disk 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.970
 hard damaged and take out all that 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 information in directly to be able to 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.960
 recover it and be able to use it when 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 we think at a certain moment that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 we had lost it we have already proceeded to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 the disney installation that he offers us 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 two options the option where you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 include all management options 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.970
 hard drive to warn us in a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.399
 determined moment of a possible failure 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.559
 of the unit and then a version 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.199
 portable that can be used in a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 pendrive to be able to recover in 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.019
 any computer directly that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 information and having a volume of 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.739
 boot and if not then generating a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 volume creating an operating system in 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 an external hard drive that you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.010
 we will add district we can see that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 once installed it offers us a double 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 menu for in this case one for each 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.410
 disk alone with that information 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 disk and the possibility to verify the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.060
 more details of all the discs or 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 configure the supervisions 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.619
 we can also temporarily stop the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.040
 smart supervision we see that we are 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.039
 indicates the temperature of this disc and of 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.409
 another disk that internal within this in 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.570
 this case is a mini mac and we can see 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.189
 as the data in the information for that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.850
 disk in addition to the same options 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.820
 let's open district and we'll see that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 we have here a series of hard drives and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.030
 to be able to display the options we will see 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.759
 the partitions that are included in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.159
 each disk each of these partitions 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.200
 includes information in the event that 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.459
 be accessible to the user for 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.280
 protect them using recovery bout and 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.869
 guaranteed recovery and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.060
 additionally we have extras like 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.000
 make backup copies in image of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.979
 m &amp; g or mount the volume in the mode 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.250
 only reading to prevent others 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.799
 applications write to disk 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.230
 accidentally and spoiling well 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.120
 the data that we try to recover 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.150
 so easy to recover files as 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 that is, we have a previous session of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.010
 5 hours ago but we can run all 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.989
 the methods of recovery or perform 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.970
 a deep universal search analysis 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.849
 of the partitions or look for the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.060
 lost hf s partitions let's turn off 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.380
 the previous session 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.630
 and simply what we have we have 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.640
 here from a series of files that do not 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.050
 have recovered at the time and we can 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 choose the folder in which we want 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.730
 recover these files obviously 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 will always be outside the structure of the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.180
 disc on which we are trying 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 retrieve information because if not 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.130
 we can overwrite that information from 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
 other files that we might need 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.040
 we also have some options for 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.830
 ignore the structure at the end of 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 folders of the recovered items and 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.790
 we can search among all the files 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 except the system and the hidden 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.019
 all files including those of the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.470
 system and the hidden or just images 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.209
 audio video file documents 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.220
 additionally we can decide the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.500
 age of the search so that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.880
 we will not have to go crazy with 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.950
 thousands of millions of files for 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 locate a single file that is the one 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.770
 we are interested all the files have 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.730
 of option of will glÃ¼ck 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.260
 to be able to quickly preview that 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.170
 file and see if those that we 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.819
 we are really looking forward or looking 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.219
 say has some preferences 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.730
 that allow us to define what types of 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:50.249
 files we want to work with when deploying 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.019
 these types of files we can decide 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:54.090
 that we want to recover then the 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.549
 different types of files there 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.620
 available we can mark or unmark 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.540
 the boxes to recover those 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.840
 records 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.790
 some come by default we can in 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.010
 any time you need a type of 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.560
 additional file in this case we can 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.689
 tell the district to request 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.849
 through a form that is included 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.190
 in upcoming acts that are included 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.799
 next updates the possibility 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.329
 to include that type of file in 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.460
 security options we will have 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.070
 a master password so that nobody 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.110
 can access recovery walt and others 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.900
 parameters and characteristics of district 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.830
 a list of items to show when 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.380
 the 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.800
 we started district to see the 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.070
 partitions ie we can for example 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.070
 mark all these elements and show 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.740
 even discs and small partitions 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.220
 activate the smart status for the disks 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.410
 hard to monitor the records before before 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.530
 hardware problems and we can 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.300
 additionally decide which discs are going 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.070
 to show the temperature or are not the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.510
 menus that we have seen here we can 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.880
 mark the or uncheck them so that 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.500
 appear or disappear and then 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.180
 we have the general options and the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.340
 possibility to uninstall disney 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.050
 directly from here if we have done 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.760
 a complete installation that includes the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.670
 smart management measures and others 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.520
 elements to manage hard drives the 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.260
 way better and faster to eliminate 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.810
 all those options that have been installed 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.630
 at the level of the system is made from 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.750
 Here we have seen how the 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.080
 preferences and let's go back 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.440
 let's save the different options 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.960
 let's get out of how we've marked in 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.940
 the preferences options the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.850
 show all the partitions we will see 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.410
 as there are many more partitions that are 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.080
 show here in this case for example 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.230
 is the disk recovery the partition 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.910
 disk recovery is indicated 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.580
 that is a disk the system does not 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.860
 recommend 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.770
 and introduce us in that partition but in 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.879
 any time we can skip that 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.740
 possibility and access that partition 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.199
 district is an extremely useful 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.210
 useful to retrieve information from 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.620
 our hard drives either because the 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.860
 we have accidentally deleted and not 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.120
 We have backup as 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.550
 forensic utility to recover 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.680
 information on damaged hard drives 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.770
 with the different options for 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.960
 hcs partitions and the possibility of 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.840
 rebuild those partitions this dream 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.930
 It is a very solid offer at a very reasonable price 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.240
 reasonable for advanced users and 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.740
 also for ite departments and 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.740
 technical services
