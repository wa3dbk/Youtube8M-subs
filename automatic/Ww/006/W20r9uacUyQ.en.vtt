00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
prominent centerpiece I've actually call

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
prominent centerpiece I've actually call
it<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> side<00:00:20.250> piece<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> root<00:00:21.420> stemming

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it a side piece it's a root stemming

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.859 
it a side piece it's a root stemming
from<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.769> left<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> tank<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.689> this

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
from the left side of the tank now this

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.740 
from the left side of the tank now this
is<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.140> represent<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:26.010> mangrove<00:00:26.789> root<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.570> some

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
sort of tree root that is reaching into

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.680 
sort of tree root that is reaching into
the<00:00:30.869> ocean<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.880> side<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> tank

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the ocean on the right side of the tank

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.200 
the ocean on the right side of the tank
I<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.079> some<00:00:34.260> corals<00:00:34.710> popping<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.030> whole

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
I have some corals popping up the whole

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
I have some corals popping up the whole
point<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.230> represent<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.460> fact

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
point of this is to represent the fact

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
point of this is to represent the fact
that<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> brackish<00:00:39.570> water<00:00:39.840> tank<00:00:40.230> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that this is a brackish water tank so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
that this is a brackish water tank so
it's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> transition<00:00:41.489> environment<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it's the transition environment from the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's the transition environment from the
marine<00:00:43.260> environment<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> freshwater

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
marine environment to the freshwater

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
marine environment to the freshwater
environment<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.070> where

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
environment and this is the water where

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
environment and this is the water where
the<00:00:47.820> green<00:00:48.030> spotted<00:00:48.420> puffer<00:00:48.629> fish<00:00:48.809> likes<00:00:49.680> to
