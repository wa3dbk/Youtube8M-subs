00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.890
 a few months after its release 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.230
 of the latest apple iphone 5 smartphone 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.970
 Let's talk about rumors 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.970
 the next smartphone from home cupertino 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.730
 momentous turn from apple looks like that apple 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.070
 want to abandon your own style of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.200
 device production passing by 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.629
 a comfortable and useful display and above all 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 which characterized the iPhone because it is 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.100
 usable with one hand of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.170
 reasonable size around 4 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.680
 inches to the new display that will be around 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.180
 between 4.7 and 5.7 inches then this 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.780
 it will be the next novelty and the most 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.190
 important news of the brand new iphone 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 I remember what I will say in this video 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.320
 they are all rumors so don't take it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.530
 these news as real but take the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.479
 with pliers even if I repeat that every 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.210
 I have been dealing with for three years 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.090
 rumor of iphone and other smartphones 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 I've always hit them then it's up to you 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 still decide the first news 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.770
 it looked more like an enlargement of the display 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.140
 that can be seen and well viewed by 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.590
 android users but from people like 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.899
 me is not well seen as a screen 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.690
 4.7 inches is really inconvenient to 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.190
 use with one hand 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.560
 the new iphone will probably be 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.929
 called iphone air to reflect the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.569
 new style of apple nomenclature 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.440
 this iphone should be 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.140
 marketed around May or 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.209
 June 2014 even if one is not excluded 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340
 marketing a presentation a 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.970
 September as happened every year then 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.569
 I will set myself the most a date of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.280
 presentation around September 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.440
 as already mentioned the size of the display 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.959
 this will also be increased thanks to 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.819
 a narrowing and of the frames of the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.670
 display that 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.209
 I could see from the screens that 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 seem to have leaked into the network 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.879
 iphone 6 photos of the new iphone if that 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.469
 have been running for some time in the 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.269
 net showing the body of 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.819
 production of this iphone and should 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.760
 be leaked by manufacturing companies 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.950
 like fox with obviously the body is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 large but allows the installation of a 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.989
 display large enough inside and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.150
 exploit it and allow the very fact 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.000
 to exploit all the space of the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.819
 body limiting the frames a bit like 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 happens on galaxy s 4 but looks like that in 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.449
 this case the apple engineers 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.449
 they did an even better job 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.560
 very display technology 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.930
 probably will always be lcd and again 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 more probably the pixel density 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.609
 it won't change because apple 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.540
 believes that it is useless to overcome the 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.280
 threshold of 331 ppi threshold above which 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.010
 the human eye already fails to 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.750
 distinguish the individual pixels so it is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.209
 useless to go over this 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.250
 definition other noises instead there 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.280
 show how the new iphone display 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.579
 6 will show a similar pixel density or 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.620
 comparable to that of galaxy s 4 io 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.579
 I find it very unlikely because 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.650
 Apple will find it useless to do an exhibition 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.290
 of the kind from the hardware auction for 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.109
 fight the samsung competition the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.419
 device will mount 2 gigabytes of ram a 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.819
 proprietary 8 processor that much 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.159
 probably will be quad core with a 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.709
 20 nanometer manufacturing process that 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.909
 the same will be produced by tsmc 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.560
 amd producer we will find one further 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.689
 a camera most likely 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.019
 always 8 megapixels with a view 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.049
 improved and an optical stabilizer 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.849
 on which apple is already working and one 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.479
 videorecording that could arrive 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.519
 most likely at 4k we will find 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.319
 plus a camera probably 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.969
 always 8 megapixels but they are not 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.190
 excluding the possibility of increasing 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.449
 this definition of the camera up 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.340
 at 13 megapixels 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.949
 but the most important novelty of this 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.229
 camera will probably be given by 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.990
 optical stabilizer that will carry one 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.760
 higher quality at the click of the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.740
 photo even with poor light conditions 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.590
 precisely because of the possibility of holding more 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.020
 open the shutter these are all 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.750
 rumors on iphone 6 or iphone air 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.639
 obviously I repeat we are always in the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.469
 Field of rumor and everything could change 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.419
 because we still find ourselves really 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.529
 so long since the release date of 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.510
 this new iphone 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.089
 I will always keep you updated with new ones 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.620
 video is about all the news concerning 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.810
 this device so stay 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.279
 connected here with the alex trans channel 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.990
 bros channel to have all the 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.909
 information on this device in 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.469
 real time and buoys that I tell you 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.089
 subscribe to the channel then for 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.550
 stay up to date with news on 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:06.020
 iphone i galaxy s 5 or whatever you want 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.520
 and I really like it if the video is there 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.289
 liked to support my work 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 comment to tell me what is wrong 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.010
 good of this video what is good 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.190
 what do you think about these rumors and up 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.449
 this new device and I greet you 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.449
 thanks for following the video
