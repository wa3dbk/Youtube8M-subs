the one robot they were rooting for

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.729 
the one robot they were rooting for
named<00:03:11.799> Adam<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:13.030> know<00:03:13.150> Hugh<00:03:13.359> Jackman<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.079> it's

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
named Adam you know Hugh Jackman is it's

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.559 
named Adam you know Hugh Jackman is it's
got<00:03:14.859> a<00:03:14.889> shadow<00:03:15.099> feature<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.879> mimics<00:03:16.239> use

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
got a shadow feature so it mimics use

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:24.809 
got a shadow feature so it mimics use
movements<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.709> one<00:03:23.889> of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.040> main<00:03:24.310> points<00:03:24.609> I

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
movements so one of the main points I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:25.979 
movements so one of the main points I
think<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:25.269> have<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.510> make<00:03:25.689> about<00:03:25.870> this

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
think that we have to make about this
