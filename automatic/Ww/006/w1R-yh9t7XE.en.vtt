to write it was to better talk about

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
to write it was to better talk about
this<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> visual<00:01:03.030> dialogue<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.600> what

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this kind of visual dialogue like what

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240 
this kind of visual dialogue like what
happens<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.500> stare<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.739> each<00:01:04.860> other<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
happens when we stare at each other and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
happens when we stare at each other and
the<00:01:05.339> assumptions<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.330> sometimes
