and we'll take a quick tour of the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.920 
and we'll take a quick tour of the
hardware<00:00:17.670> because<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> very<00:00:18.630> cool

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
hardware because this is a very cool

device<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.550> unique

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
device as you can see it's got a unique

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.529 
device as you can see it's got a unique
hinge<00:00:21.660> slider<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> sort<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.820> pops<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
hinge slider so it sort of pops up and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.259 
hinge slider so it sort of pops up and
out<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.560> does<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> slightly<00:00:26.699> thinner

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
out this does make it slightly thinner

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
can see some of the gaming performance

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.910 
can see some of the gaming performance
on<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.090> phone<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:10.730> interface<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.270> very

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
the controls are going to be very

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.470 
the controls are going to be very
sensitive<00:05:30.669> but<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.760> also<00:05:31.880> get<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.090> really<00:05:32.330> nice

compelling 3d games like this because

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:53.980 
compelling 3d games like this because
with<00:05:53.060> great<00:05:53.210> hardware<00:05:53.599> people<00:05:53.870> would

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
with great hardware people would

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.369 
with great hardware people would
definitely<00:05:54.110> buy<00:05:54.409> them<00:05:58.930> so<00:05:59.930> in<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.139> end<00:06:00.229> the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
definitely buy them so in the end the

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.050 
definitely buy them so in the end the
t-mobile<00:06:00.680> g2<00:06:01.129> is<00:06:01.280> really<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.550> great<00:06:01.610> piece<00:06:02.030> of

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
hardware but its success is going to

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.719 
hardware but its success is going to
mostly<00:06:04.099> rely<00:06:04.490> on<00:06:04.699> how<00:06:05.389> much<00:06:05.539> people<00:06:05.780> like<00:06:06.199> that

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.719 
effects here which are very neat but in
some<00:06:17.479> ways<00:06:18.009> android<00:06:19.009> has<00:06:19.129> really<00:06:19.430> just<00:06:19.639> been

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
some ways android has really just been

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.719 
some ways android has really just been
left<00:06:20.060> behind<00:06:20.210> like<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.930> music<00:06:21.289> player<00:06:21.729> the

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
left behind like the music player the

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.580 
left behind like the music player the
music<00:06:23.030> player<00:06:23.210> on<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.509> t-mobile<00:06:23.840> g2<00:06:24.319> is

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
music player on the t-mobile g2 is

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.159 
music player on the t-mobile g2 is
pretty<00:06:25.250> much<00:06:25.400> exactly<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:26.389> same<00:06:26.659> as<00:06:26.960> the

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
pretty much exactly the same as the

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.180 
pretty much exactly the same as the
music<00:06:27.289> player<00:06:27.740> on<00:06:28.069> the<00:06:29.060> original<00:06:29.449> t-mobile<00:06:29.930> g1

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
music player on the original t-mobile g1

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.770 
music player on the original t-mobile g1
it<00:06:31.190> really<00:06:31.400> hasn't<00:06:31.580> changed<00:06:31.729> much<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.449> still

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
it really hasn't changed much I still

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.050 
it really hasn't changed much I still
like<00:06:32.990> that<00:06:33.020> you<00:06:33.319> can<00:06:33.590> search<00:06:34.430> automatically

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
like that you can search automatically

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.629 
like that you can search automatically
from<00:06:35.389> the<00:06:35.599> music<00:06:35.900> player<00:06:36.280> but<00:06:37.280> it<00:06:37.370> doesn't

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
from the music player but it doesn't

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.610 
from the music player but it doesn't
offer<00:06:37.759> any<00:06:38.030> advanced<00:06:38.389> playback<00:06:38.930> controls<00:06:39.440> or

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
offer any advanced playback controls or

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.439 
offer any advanced playback controls or
eq<00:06:40.069> options<00:06:40.520> it's<00:06:40.729> really<00:06:40.940> just<00:06:41.090> not<00:06:41.240> very

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
eq options it's really just not very

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:44.469 
eq options it's really just not very
impressive<00:06:41.900> for<00:06:42.289> multimedia<00:06:42.969> so<00:06:43.969> that's<00:06:44.300> the

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
impressive for multimedia so that's the

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.019 
impressive for multimedia so that's the
t-mobile<00:06:44.810> g2<00:06:45.259> it's<00:06:45.919> a<00:06:46.069> very<00:06:46.340> nice<00:06:46.550> piece<00:06:46.849> of

t-mobile g2 it's a very nice piece of

t-mobile g2 it's a very nice piece of
hardware<00:06:47.389> but<00:06:48.139> it's<00:06:48.289> definitely<00:06:48.620> not<00:06:49.099> the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
hardware but it's definitely not the
