both sessions really which is which is a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.970 
both sessions really which is which is a
good<00:02:24.220> way<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.370> thinking<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.880> suppose<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:26.470> it's

then<00:03:04.630> again<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.110> took<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.560> outfield

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
then again you know you took an outfield

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
player into a goalkeeping session and

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.210

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
you'd be able to last about five minutes

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.880
