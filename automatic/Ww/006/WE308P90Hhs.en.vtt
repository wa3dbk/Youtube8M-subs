00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.459
 Scenes from Monday night students are being picked up by police officers from the lecture hall 3 of the 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.009
 i-miev Fiege building worn out 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.929
 The evacuation marks the end of a week-long dispute 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.139
 between student occupants and uni-management 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 but how could it come to that? 2 1 look back 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.390
 Everything starts with the nationwide education strike 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.570
 also in Dortmund the students on the street for a 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.570
 to demonstrate a fairer education system 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.980
 a week later then the occupation of the auditorium Preisetikett the battered St 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.870
 Rudolf 0 2 a spontaneously organized group of 400 students stormed 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.250
 1 pm the lecture hall "I am seven 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.650
 I would have been fed up with always saying that 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.890
 the solidarization has been sold 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.500
 March percent this only became an arm if they anyway from the man 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.810
 after several inquiries 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 One of these is the abolition of tuition fees 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 more democracy in the education system 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.990
 its about fundamental reform of bachelor master programs 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.190
 on Wednesday at the student assembly the auditorium from all 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.020
 seams 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.770
 a thousand students have come 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 to talk with Rector Ursula Gather about better study conditions 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.290
 to discuss 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.210
 many squatters from lecture hall 1 are also inspired on the spot by the occupation 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.910
 The students in conversation with the principal make their anger air 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910
 and exercise sharp criticism of current study systems 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 It is years of frustration Jens invites 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.310
 In the coming days, the two parties will be using the media for the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.880
 Interpretation sovereignty the most sensitive 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 Director stresses that the squatters are preventing their fellow students from studying 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.039
 the squatters, on the other hand, speak of growing solidarity 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.020
 while the students set up in Lecture 1 home increases the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.020
 uni-management the pressure on the occupiers wants to see concrete demand 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.419
 the previous approaches are considered by the Rectorate unrealistic 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.879
 but the grassroots voting behavior of the students 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.109
 makes fast solutions impossible 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.389
 On Thursday, the students have to discuss in plenary whether they are in the lecture hall 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.959
 3 and 7 the uni-management had offered him this 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.549
 after much back and forth on Friday evening, the things are packed the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.029
 Besetzer changes Saturday in the lecture hall 3 too late for the uni-line 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.430
 So for the first time last night, the students will be looking for success in the lecture hall 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.499
 leaving on Friday night in search of found she found canceled 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.790
 because the studies were not ready to accept our offer yet 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.579
 Could submit counter offer 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.939
 then the search was canceled and students asked them yesterday 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.519
 Haaser leave 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.739
 because we have the one for that we also see and have the fire as eternal 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.470
 This morning for the last time asked to want the heritage called Persian operation in the 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.930
 Auditorium 3 also quite stupid take place with the seats in the lecture hall 3 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 we actually see ourselves as percent 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.659
 not the legal because the one would be there 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 and demands of 4 degrees 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.120
 followed in the menstruation that the police should move around 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.730
 what is the turn of the listener? 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.029
 I can not confirm 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.579
 St 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.489
 In the evening, the director is on site 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.489
 am with the police who subsequently cleared the building 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.409
 the squatters can be carried out and celebrated by fellow students 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.150
 they value the eviction as personal defeat of the Rectors WÃ¼rzburger 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.430
 found if the directors did not go down who about the police 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.110
 but if she had simply had typical current size 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.419
 has become students with us 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.639
 to argue on a linguistic level and dialogue 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.199
 To visit this is an indictment for them for a person's function 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.599
 at this university and thus also for the Ã¶vp University of Dortmund 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.189
 View of the University, however, the owners had long since the backing in 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.939
 lost to their own ranks 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.359
 So even the Alster 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.620
 which as a substitute for the actual fiscal year, the committee will where such 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.340
 Even protesting he did not go behind the trials 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.840
 Today, one percent of the population has been supported in the clear. "We condemn them 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.990
 They did not happen and percent tried again today with the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.960
 To speak to players what mediation attempts I accepted 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.099
 As far as I know, no sprayers are allowed to speak in the Oskar district of Dortmund 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.180
 But feels misunderstood by the press secretary of the university 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.030
 and make it clear the day after 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.169
 the Grizzlys Empolis key that she would not give 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.789
 that does not mean that she is 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.159
 Could I be the dfb team first must be 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.240
 therefore 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.849
 it's just a feeling of levitation playing 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.849
 in that context, I would really like to know why 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.740
 because we are accurate and the procedure is approachable in the future large percent 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.419
 the largest number of students 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.300
 and there are also many studies that do not see this for themselves 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.139
 and 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.800
 I believe such phases, we drove well with our position mischief 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.930
 there really caught on me Â»Ones percent 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.710
 Being an institution leads at 11 percent the election percent 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.909
 for large parts of the student body 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.469
 with the signed memorandum the student remains at least one 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:32.599
 partial success 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.610
 the contract was signed by 14 rectors from NRW including Ursula Gather 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.310
 have announced on central criticisms of the education strike
