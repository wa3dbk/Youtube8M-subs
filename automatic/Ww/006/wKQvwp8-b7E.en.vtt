00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.519
 and good morning all his friends I hope 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.630
 that you're fine 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.039
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.859
 new video on farming simulator 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 2015 for a fashion presentation and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.769
 today I presented you a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 masseuse ferguson combine harvester 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.540
 9895 so frankly it's very rare to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.159
 have to present monks massey 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 ferguson because simply 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.239
 usually they are very very badly 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 realized but I must confess that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 this harvesters there she is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
 frankly pretty well done and more 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 it's quite rare on farming 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 reapers massy ferguson but that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.159
 frankly it's pretty much done 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 all why make a quick tour 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.159
 no frankly we see that the tires 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.409
 are pretty well done so there is 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.059
 double wheel in the front as we could 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.040
 to see him 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 frankly she is really very very 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 well detailed very very well done 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.290
 good after me I find that when not in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 for guard from above I find that it 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.350
 is a bit too square at the level 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.240
 the tramp and where I find it is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 a little too square but otherwise frankly 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 I find it really well done for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 a reaper massy ferguson 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 found that we do not find much 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.500
 on the 15th so frankly not bad 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.630
 So there with this set this wagon me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 door bar cutting so with the bar 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 cutting that is with also so I 'm 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 to see years and a pack where there is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.330
 several modes so first of all the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 reaper that costs 3,190 thousand euros 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 which makes 459 horses only one capacity 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 of hopper of 12330 4 liters and which 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.940
 therefore suitable for the macd so have 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 it is the cutter bar so at cost 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.150
 maintenance of 380 euros per day so 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.460
 it's still quite expensive when 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.820
 even quite expensive but in reality it's up to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.760
 just about that so the cutterbar for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 cereals so the mac of which 60 that 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.659
 I told you so there are sixty 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.320
 ten thousand euros and the gunson master 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.299
 horns 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.250
 so that's the cutterbar for the 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.780
 corn that is at 45 1999 1000 euros is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.500
 so here in various actually we're going to go 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.920
 we do not wear you 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.240
 two door trolleys cut so who in 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.680
 do it's just luxury ones 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.470
 farm that was on the xiii that were 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 reconverted the color been modified they 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.530
 are made for the two bars of 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.480
 couple so frankly it's rather 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.110
 practice which carts they be 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.360
 delivered with 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.270
 especially that it works pretty well there the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.510
 cutting bar did not fall well even 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.890
 if even so good late epa but I the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.970
 grows very well muzzled pose fast done 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.100
 on top like that to larache 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.720
 but having cutting does not move too much 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.540
 so it's going a warrior and a little 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.530
 beacon but that we frankly 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.690
 it's not bad done here is the little 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.070
 reapers frankly she is not 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.959
 wrong why immediately mounted 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.340
 inside look at the little step 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.810
 the focus extinguisher 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.520
 it's not bad so we get in so 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 listen also the sound a coffee is 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.000
 really beautiful 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 frankly it's really a 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.069
 super are so we gonna frankly she 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.450
 is rather well done rather well 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.800
 detailed so we'll see them at 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.540
 inside so the inside that is not 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.950
 badly done also what's good it's 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.319
 that she is retro who are functional 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.420
 I want to tell you I play at most 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.870
 down and retro are cons but 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.980
 functional so that's pretty good 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.900
 so otherwise at the inner level 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.870
 frankly she is not too badly done 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.730
 the storyteller who works the gauge here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.220
 it seems to me that they also work 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.900
 watch a counter level here when 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.370
 I retreat there is a small camera that is 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.769
 puts down does not work well obviously 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.430
 but it's frankly a little detail 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.470
 which is rather nice here is otherwise 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.510
 the beacons are functional when 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.480
 we press x of course we spite 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.819
 and it then works at the level of 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.720
 options we have when we press the 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.670
 nem no 8 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.590
 we can open the little door here 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.239
 so that's where the engine is 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.329
 we can watch his hunger not the engine 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.010
 but finally for the short reaper I 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.540
 understood me so the very good who 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.170
 is frankly not badly done too is 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.250
 of the most unfolds pretty well and when 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.019
 we support not to 7 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.510
 we can simply open the door 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.190
 so that's not bad so the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.479
 indicators are indeed well 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.979
 looked the same on the retro there 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.020
 frankly it's not bad a behind 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.370
 me there it works wonderfully on the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.490
 cutting bar we're just going to look fast 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.550
 do it so here is the same thing 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.870
 works the beacon is functional 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.460
 so lighthouses here it works 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.840
 so that's perfect is that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.220
 it looks inside went there at 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.820
 relay so French hair 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.500
 lÃ©clercq pretty much that fire on the 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.090
 so frankly she is not bad 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.560
 like I just removed the display and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.510
 show how it looks in the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.060
 game is actually so frankly we 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.960
 see that she is really pretty good 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.729
 represented well-honed size and 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.530
 frankly it's really a very 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.520
 beautiful reapers so hop 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.570
 me what I'm going to do by cons 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.010
 it's just going to just go 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.330
 attested a little bit harvested 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.250
 to be able a little bit how she 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.570
 works so we know where I want to 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.340
 you also specify for the traces 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.050
 as you can see the traces 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.569
 will double because on some 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.189
 modes of the times they have duplicates 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.800
 ah the traces of the two wheels that there 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.610
 frankly it's working so it's 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.099
 just perfect 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.969
 so we're going to be the cutter bar if I'm going 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:28.219
 obviously happens here hop nickel 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.229
 so the couple's pond was not written 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.839
 how much does the state do I think the fact 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.179
 about 10 meters 10 medical that 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:39.020
 it's a good little cutterbar 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:40.610
 which is frankly not bad so we're going 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.639
 test a little bit harvested for 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.840
 see what it can give 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.000
 here is it 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.740
 instead of his coffee I'm not 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.330
 implied the little beep she did 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.790
 the sound she did all of a sudden there but 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.919
 frankly she has a beautiful sound set 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.720
 reapers it's just huge 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.389
 here is now really works 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.820
 very well are just perfect just forced 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.080
 on the cutterbar one can note if 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.000
 we can remove it's perfect 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.220
 frankly this mayonnaise did 1 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.350
 are these huge super beautiful sounds 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.840
 that she does not like and behind 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.430
 frankly well done frankly very 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.970
 very very beautiful reapers that I 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.710
 advise you 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.300
 because of reapers like that one 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.500
 do not find it often here we see 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.570
 also on the dashboard here at 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.650
 how much is filling up at and all have 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.990
 frankly it's not bad I do not know 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.090
 if the gauge finally it works after 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.400
 that you see but frankly for 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.270
 a precious massy ferguson not 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.280
 a lot about the 15 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.590
 this one I advise you it 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.690
 really works very very well she 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.190
 works wonderfully 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.320
 so here is so for fans of massey 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.850
 ferguson I advise you the link 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.860
 will be in the description as always 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.500
 and to download it you will have everything 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.050
 just just to click on it 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.000
 So here's this friends I tell you to 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.860
 the next I hope this little 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.780
 fashion presentation will have you more than 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.669
 cables and do not hesitate do not hesitate to 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.560
 let go a little super saffron blue thumb
