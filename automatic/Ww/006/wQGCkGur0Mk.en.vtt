sometimes you see you know inspiration

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
sometimes you see you know inspiration
from<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.870> heritage<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.290> inspiration<00:01:43.920> from

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
from the heritage of inspiration from

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.270 
from the heritage of inspiration from
the<00:01:44.340> Nordic<00:01:44.690> tradition<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.920> some<00:01:46.920> does<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.190> in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the Nordic tradition and some does is in

the Nordic tradition and some does is in
the<00:01:47.370> foreground<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.000> sometimes<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.510> the

the foreground and sometimes in the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
the foreground and sometimes in the
background<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:50.010> has<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
background but I don't think it has to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:01.780 
background but I don't think it has to
be<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> other
