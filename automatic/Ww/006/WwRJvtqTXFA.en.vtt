account<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.139> find<00:00:10.379> the<00:00:10.469> glass<00:00:10.680> shell

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
account is going to find the glass shell

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.369 
account is going to find the glass shell
on<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> outside<00:00:12.209> and<00:00:12.420> because<00:00:13.020> we<00:00:13.170> didn't

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
on the outside and because we didn't

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.320 
on the outside and because we didn't
have<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.920> room<00:00:14.219> down<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.029> lower

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
have a lot of room down in the lower

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.170 
have a lot of room down in the lower
sections<00:00:15.840> we've<00:00:16.110> put<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.590> HD<00:00:17.520> camera<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
sections we've put the HD camera in the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.000 
sections we've put the HD camera in the
top<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.540> it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
top of it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:30.740

free<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> swing<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:50.910> while<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.050> inside

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
free to swing open while they're inside

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
free to swing open while they're inside
the<00:00:52.440> payload<00:00:53.010> Bay<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the payload Bay like this with a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.380 
the payload Bay like this with a
parachute<00:00:54.719> between<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:56.370> book<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.880> body

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
parachute between them the book of body

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
parachute between them the book of body
chief<00:00:57.690> stops<00:00:58.380> them<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.590> opening<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
chief stops them from opening and the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.310 
chief stops them from opening and the
parachute<00:01:00.210> stops<00:01:00.719> them<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:00.899> folding

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
parachute stops them from folding

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.530 
parachute stops them from folding
inwards<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.579> you'll<00:01:02.760> notice<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.270> they

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
inwards now you'll notice that they

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.529 
inwards now you'll notice that they
overlap<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.649> so<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.909> only<00:01:06.090> need<00:01:06.299> one

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
overlap that's so that we only need one

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.809 
overlap that's so that we only need one
attachment<00:01:07.079> point<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.709> when<00:01:08.039> this<00:01:08.189> pause<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
attachment point so when this pause that

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.899 
attachment point so when this pause that
also<00:01:08.969> holds<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.600> funny<00:01:09.869> place<00:01:10.459> this<00:01:11.459> while

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
also holds this funny place this while

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.029 
also holds this funny place this while
loop<00:01:12.149> just<00:01:12.479> simply<00:01:12.840> hooks<00:01:13.229> around<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.679> servo

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
loop just simply hooks around the servo

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.099 
loop just simply hooks around the servo
horn<00:01:14.219> which<00:01:15.149> keeps<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> whole<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:15.990> in

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
horn which keeps the whole thing in

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.349 
horn which keeps the whole thing in
place<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:17.039> one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.429> advantages<00:01:17.999> of<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
place now one of the advantages of this

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.569 
place now one of the advantages of this
is<00:01:18.799> because<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.950> positively<00:01:20.310> polly

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
is because it's positively polly

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.639 
is because it's positively polly
retained<00:01:20.969> by<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.179> servo<00:01:21.600> motor<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.469> don't

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
retained by the servo motor we don't

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.529 
retained by the servo motor we don't
actually<00:01:22.889> need<00:01:23.219> a<00:01:23.279> lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> friction<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.359> this

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
actually need a lot of friction on this

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.289 
actually need a lot of friction on this
part<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> most<00:01:26.159> fan<00:01:26.429> to<00:01:26.609> keep<00:01:26.819> it<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> place

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
part of the most fan to keep it in place

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
part of the most fan to keep it in place
like<00:01:27.569> you<00:01:27.719> do<00:01:27.899> with<00:01:28.079> conventional<00:01:28.490> piston

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
like you do with conventional piston

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.230 
like you do with conventional piston
ejection<00:01:30.409> methods<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.069> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> very<00:01:32.700> free<00:01:33.029> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ejection methods so this is very free to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
ejection methods so this is very free to
move<00:01:33.359> in<00:01:33.599> and<00:01:33.749> out<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.289> because<00:01:34.469> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
move in and out but because it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.089 
move in and out but because it's
positively<00:01:35.840> retained<00:01:36.840> within<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.469> payload

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
positively retained within the payload

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.669 
positively retained within the payload
bay<00:01:38.340> there's<00:01:39.179> no<00:01:39.329> chance<00:01:39.569> of<00:01:39.749> drag<00:01:40.020> separation

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
bay there's no chance of drag separation

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.469 
bay there's no chance of drag separation
of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> nose<00:01:41.130> cone<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.240> once<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> gets<00:01:43.349> ejected

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
of the nose cone so once it gets ejected

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.319 
of the nose cone so once it gets ejected
and<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.349> then<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.770> pressure<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:48.179> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and this then will pressure from the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.569 
and this then will pressure from the
walls<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.749> the<00:01:48.929> body<00:01:49.200> cube<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.369> free

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
walls of the body cube is it just free

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.589 
walls of the body cube is it just free
to<00:01:50.819> swing<00:01:51.719> open<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.229> parachute<00:01:52.649> pulls<00:01:53.099> out

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
to swing open the parachute pulls out

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.789 
to swing open the parachute pulls out
and<00:01:54.599> then<00:01:54.719> you'll<00:01:54.869> notice<00:01:55.049> there's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.499> couple

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
and then you'll notice there's a couple

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.609 
and then you'll notice there's a couple
of<00:01:55.889> lips<00:01:56.099> here<00:01:56.459> around<00:01:57.329> which<00:01:57.569> we<00:01:57.810> hook<00:01:58.049> rubber

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of lips here around which we hook rubber

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.919 
of lips here around which we hook rubber
bands<00:01:59.099> that<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.669> tied<00:01:59.880> up<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.389> on<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.749> body

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
bands that are tied up here on the body

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.019 
bands that are tied up here on the body
cube<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.439> help<00:02:01.649> push<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> whole<00:02:02.310> thing<00:02:02.549> out

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
cube that help push the whole thing out

the<00:03:58.190> servo<00:03:58.549> motor<00:03:58.579> with<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.359> hole<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.750> for

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
the servo motor with the hole that for

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.680 
the servo motor with the hole that for
the<00:04:00.109> wire<00:04:00.640> from<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.700> grapple<00:04:02.150> arm<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.569> can

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
the wire from the grapple arm so you can

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.920 
the wire from the grapple arm so you can
actually<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.290> servo<00:04:03.620> motor<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:04.069> there

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
actually see the servo motor in there

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.690 
actually see the servo motor in there
these<00:04:05.930> are<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.260> holes<00:04:06.440> are<00:04:06.769> just<00:04:07.160> used<00:04:07.489> for

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
these are the holes are just used for

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.660 
these are the holes are just used for
passing<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:09.350> shock<00:04:09.650> cord<00:04:09.889> through<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.549> it

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
passing the shock cord through that it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.000 
passing the shock cord through that it
touches<00:04:10.880> back<00:04:11.239> into<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.500> main<00:04:12.650> market

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
touches back into the to the main market

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.949 
touches back into the to the main market
here<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:14.030> have<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.359> top<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.780> pressure

of the payload Bay from the pressure

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.820 
of the payload Bay from the pressure
chamber<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.260> can<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.620> pull<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.860> pin<00:04:46.100> out<00:04:46.250> and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
chamber we can just pull the pin out and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.970 
chamber we can just pull the pin out and
then<00:04:48.830> disconnect<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.400> short<00:04:49.640> cord

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
then disconnect the short cord

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.530 
then disconnect the short cord
next<00:04:51.980> comes<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.220> electronics<00:04:52.820> package<00:04:53.000> and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
next comes the electronics package and

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.330 
next comes the electronics package and
that's<00:04:53.990> just<00:04:54.320> slice<00:04:54.530> over<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.920> shock<00:04:55.130> cord

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
that's just slice over the shock cord

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.490 
that's just slice over the shock cord
and<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.670> top<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.120> pressure<00:04:56.300> chamber<00:04:56.660> fits

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
and the top of the pressure chamber fits

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.090 
and the top of the pressure chamber fits
inside<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:58.040> fiberglass<00:04:58.460> tube<00:04:59.590> the<00:05:00.590> lower

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
inside this fiberglass tube the lower

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.400 
inside this fiberglass tube the lower
centering<00:05:01.670> ring<00:05:01.850> sits<00:05:02.210> up<00:05:02.360> against<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.900> PVC

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
centering ring sits up against the PVC

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.680 
centering ring sits up against the PVC
tube<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.520> helps<00:05:04.850> support<00:05:04.940> all<00:05:05.420> of<00:05:05.570> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
tube and that helps support all of the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.360 
tube and that helps support all of the
electronics<00:05:06.230> that's<00:05:06.440> in<00:05:06.590> here<00:05:06.830> against<00:05:07.190> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
electronics that's in here against the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.500 
electronics that's in here against the
g-forces<00:05:08.770> over<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> top<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.400> we<00:05:11.240> just

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
g-forces over the top of that we just

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.670 
g-forces over the top of that we just
slide<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.620> rest<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.220> body<00:05:13.400> tube<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.680> then

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
slide the rest of the body tube and then

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.560 
slide the rest of the body tube and then
back<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.220> screw<00:05:16.520> down<00:05:16.700> at<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.090> appropriate

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
back that screw down at the appropriate

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.270 
back that screw down at the appropriate
holes<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:18.020> just<00:05:18.350> don't<00:05:18.500> have<00:05:18.650> them<00:05:18.740> lined<00:05:18.950> up<00:05:19.130> at

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
holes I just don't have them lined up at

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.350 
holes I just don't have them lined up at
the<00:05:19.310> moment<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:21.080> here<00:05:21.440> we<00:05:21.560> hook<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.360> rubber

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
the moment so here we hook the rubber

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.390 
the moment so here we hook the rubber
bands<00:05:23.810> onto<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.230> grapple<00:05:24.590> arms<00:05:24.920> and<00:05:25.160> put<00:05:25.310> the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
bands onto the grapple arms and put the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.580 
bands onto the grapple arms and put the
parachute<00:05:25.670> in<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.240> then<00:05:26.900> it's<00:05:27.050> just<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.440> matter

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
parachute in and then it's just a matter

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.900 
parachute in and then it's just a matter
of<00:05:27.970> compressing<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:30.160> against<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.430> quite<00:05:31.880> a

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
of compressing it against it is quite a

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.750 
of compressing it against it is quite a
bit<00:05:32.090> of<00:05:32.210> force<00:05:32.420> and<00:05:32.810> then<00:05:33.560> we<00:05:34.250> just<00:05:34.460> hook<00:05:34.640> it

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
bit of force and then we just hook it

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.750 
bit of force and then we just hook it
over<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.270> servo<00:05:35.960> motor<00:05:36.250> here<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.340> can<00:05:37.550> see

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
over the servo motor here you can see

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.730 
over the servo motor here you can see
the<00:05:38.030> wire<00:05:38.660> from<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.960> grappler<00:05:39.380> I've<00:05:39.590> hooked

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
the wire from the grappler I've hooked

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.940 
the wire from the grappler I've hooked
over<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.280> servo<00:05:40.700> arm<00:05:41.200> it's<00:05:42.200> actually<00:05:42.560> hooked

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
over the servo arm it's actually hooked

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.630 
over the servo arm it's actually hooked
over<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.430> center<00:05:43.970> of<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.390> axle<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:46.220> provide

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
over the center of the axle to provide

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.450 
over the center of the axle to provide
maximum<00:05:46.850> strength<00:05:47.510> okay<00:05:48.410> so<00:05:48.650> let's<00:05:49.250> have<00:05:49.340> a

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
maximum strength okay so let's have a

00:05:49.460 --> 00:06:03.659 
maximum strength okay so let's have a
look<00:05:49.580> how<00:05:49.760> this<00:05:49.910> works

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.719 

and<00:06:04.669> then<00:06:04.909> we<00:06:05.029> have<00:06:05.180> to<00:06:05.330> wait<00:06:05.479> until<00:06:05.689> it<00:06:05.960> turned

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
and then we have to wait until it turned

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.610 
and then we have to wait until it turned
and<00:06:08.050> it's<00:06:09.050> now<00:06:09.229> found<00:06:10.029> so<00:06:11.029> when<00:06:11.779> we<00:06:11.960> break<00:06:12.439> the

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
and it's now found so when we break the

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.300 
and it's now found so when we break the
break<00:06:12.800> wire<00:06:13.090> about<00:06:14.090> 6<00:06:14.419> seconds<00:06:14.749> later<00:06:15.310> the

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
break wire about 6 seconds later the

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:26.050 
break wire about 6 seconds later the
parachute<00:06:16.759> should<00:06:16.789> deploy<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:25.460> so<00:06:25.759> here<00:06:25.999> it

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
parachute should deploy and so here it

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.459 
parachute should deploy and so here it
is<00:06:26.180> from<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:26.509> different<00:06:26.719> angle<00:06:27.039> and<00:06:29.139> after<00:06:30.139> it

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
is from a different angle and after it

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.239 
is from a different angle and after it
sound<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:31.639> can<00:06:31.849> sit<00:06:31.999> now<00:06:32.090> seat<00:06:32.360> turned<00:06:33.249> and

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:34.249 
sound you can sit now seat turned and

sound you can sit now seat turned and
when<00:06:35.150> we<00:06:35.270> break<00:06:35.449> the<00:06:35.659> wire<00:06:35.810> six<00:06:36.800> seconds<00:06:37.129> later

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
when we break the wire six seconds later

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:46.899 
when we break the wire six seconds later
parachute<00:06:38.569> will<00:06:38.749> deploy<00:06:45.219> and<00:06:46.219> you<00:06:46.550> can<00:06:46.729> see

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909
