 mario hernandez 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.770
 of oneself 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 it's time to listen to the public's opinion 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.570
 what they have to say about this subject 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.230
 the politician who can not have a life of their own 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.560
 because I will live 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.160
 Bush father of health of mom or dad 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.740
 they can not have a space for them to be able to function as an institution 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.290
 free living 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 they present the problems by the 9th 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 well then welcome as santa inés this opinion table 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 with this question what can a man who lives with his in-laws do? 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.619
 but it bothers you a lot 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.820
 that get into the education of their children 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.439
 we start with you clear 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.230
 well I think something that is very important 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.299
 e is 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.579
 a comments and ideas do not live with the sun 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.860
 the word married 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.680
 speak if we see it in another way 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.869
 its almost what is not of receipt 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.529
 means married hunting 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.059
 two 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.149
 has a family that is forming a couple that is 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.209
 getting tired 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 is living together with your spouse not 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.009
 not with the parents either of one as of another day 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.849
 because he was 3 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.329
 some may will bring many problems 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.310
 today among them that all begin to put in the education of their children 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.940
 He said that he finally chose the parties, respectfully, I think that he should not 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.459
 be nothing comfortable to live with 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.869
 you will know at the end of the day is what people have been found dead in the 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.659
 road need 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.429
 not economic or the community so this happens 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:17.039
 if that's the situation he believed and the in-laws start to get into how 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:21.779
 to educate a child even if it is not one I think the couple should have a good 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:26.289
 communication of knowing what it is that you want to do in this regard 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.139
 agreement 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.410
 and being able to start a conversation with grandparents and in-laws 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.720
 to be able to defend itself iniesta mind yes and no 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.200
 it has to be a conversation 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.149
 nice constructive saná 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.749
 to be able to set clear limits that it follows that 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.289
 despite being the mind of the parents many times what they do 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.169
 it is because they leave all the responsibility 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.549
 of Education 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.339
 of the grandchildren because they work or because they have other types of situations and that is 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:04:00.180
 what makes rock then if I leave you the obligation when it suits me if you 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.930
 allow 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.859
 well if you are points not 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.999
 so I think the important thing would be as a couple 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.130
 husbands 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.269
 with that agreement that yes and no 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.649
 and in a way 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.409
 assertive in a loving way 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.799
 to be able to talk to parents in order to put those limits that are already 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.660
 convenient if the judge live 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.930
 away from there as soon as possible there is nothing if I know I like them 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.419
 they will not go to the water not pleasant they exist and gilberto everyone in their house 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 if they come with the pp 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
 it's not being 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.960
 It is not comfortable to live with your current job that is lost with them 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.490
 for being a poncho 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.680
 and many times the real 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.650
 unemployment is not willing 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.650
 to offer them nothing either the wife 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.749
 let her stay 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.189
 asked them how is it possible that you came up portico alba although experts 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.930
 Swedish although these 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.569
 when they will be invited to the children 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.580
 the team is going to go 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.430
 husbands spouses 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.680
 from caspar 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.100
 but the truth is that if threats are given months, because they are not so 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.559
 culandras consequences not 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:11.800
 he arrives by 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.039
 an economic support for julien after the picón 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.069
 typical provisional solution we will have to go to as-work sector 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.349
 that would have to be before not since before you married push to foresee all those 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.480
 things were not going to get to marriage 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.800
 and now to see where we are going to go abroad 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.120
 as someone said no the ph I asked him to win 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.070
 four great deals of hamas that offers me extra 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.680
 but afterwards and that he feels sorry also to be direct with a safe conduct proposes 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.849
 marriage 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.550
 and the worst thing is that when we go to see what you do you think 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:52.849
 i paella and we propose you pop recently that if it was proven that we have 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:53.909
 space 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.000
 India outside 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.220
 because finally in that house where they are going to put this this couple does not 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.599
 only this couple 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.539
 there is already an authority not so it is winds there come show problems not so 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.770
 I agree 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.270
 with all of you 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.430
 because the rings to the sun is a principle from the beginning of creation the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.830
 he says the man will leave his father and his mother I was scared 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.029
 incera one flesh this is a separate place implies giving up the authority 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:27.530
 of the parents an image totally by with ugarte 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.879
 The authority 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.069
 and another team 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.460
 when they get married obviously 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.419
 leave 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.020
 than having paternal authority 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.410
 they were scattered authority because not only that but also the word 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.419
 exercises a unity pattern in its 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.749
 pacts it's time to go to a court 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.169
 and coming back then let's put it together talking about this 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:56.059
 the direct issue is living with the in-laws if indeed it is a 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:59.059
 solution we return 

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:05.599
 you can and should live with the in-laws 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.599
 when returning the goods 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.789
 the full council 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:17.369
 press
