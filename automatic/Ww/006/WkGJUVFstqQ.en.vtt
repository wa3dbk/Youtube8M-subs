you get the general idea

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.100 
you get the general idea
now<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> key<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:33.780> here

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
now the key that I you have to see here

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.850 
now the key that I you have to see here
is<00:02:34.260> now<00:02:34.530> when<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.660> put<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.750> back<00:02:36.780> down<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.800> is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
is now when I put it back down this is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.040 
is now when I put it back down this is
actually<00:02:38.400> written<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.060> reasonably<00:02:39.750> decent

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
actually written at a reasonably decent

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.250 
actually written at a reasonably decent
size<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.610> was<00:02:41.760> much<00:02:41.940> easier<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.630> write<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
size but it was much easier to write it

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
size but it was much easier to write it
because<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> used<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> automatic<00:02:45.000> scrolling

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
because it used the automatic scrolling

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.560 
because it used the automatic scrolling
mechanism<00:02:46.850> going<00:02:47.850> back<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.390> previous

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
mechanism going back to the previous

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.520 
mechanism going back to the previous
page<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.560> wanted<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.640> show<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.850> pen<00:02:51.270> colors<00:02:51.840> cut

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
page I wanted to show you pen colors cut

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.580 
page I wanted to show you pen colors cut
and<00:02:52.680> paste<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.220> erase<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.990> we'll<00:02:55.140> come<00:02:55.320> over

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
and paste and erase so we'll come over

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.160 
and paste and erase so we'll come over
here<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.920> our<00:02:56.070> scratch<00:02:56.760> page<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> let's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
here to our scratch page and let's

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.040 
here to our scratch page and let's
change<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> pen<00:02:59.220> color<00:02:59.700> I'll<00:03:00.210> make<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.660> bright

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
little bigger and older you should be

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.500
