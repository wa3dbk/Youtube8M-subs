00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
correct line for a mocker and the third

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.140 
correct line for a mocker and the third
part<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.650> where<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.220> maca<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.760> going<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.030> come

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
with the lid on top what happens is

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.830 
with the lid on top what happens is
coffee<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> absorb<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.600> lot<00:02:49.810> of

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
humidity or flavors around it so you got

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.430 
humidity or flavors around it so you got
to<00:02:52.180> make<00:02:52.270> sure<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.600> keep<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.900> somewhere<00:02:53.260> where

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
to make sure you keep it somewhere where

I'm<00:02:58.990> going<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> take<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> coffee<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.950> we're

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
I'm going to take a coffee and we're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:11.760 
I'm going to take a coffee and we're
going<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.250> spoon<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.730> into<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.150> filter<00:03:10.770> we're

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
going to spoon it into the filter we're

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.220 
going to spoon it into the filter we're
going<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.950> put<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:12.760> enough<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:13.959> comes

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
going to put in just enough so it comes

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.070 
going to put in just enough so it comes
up<00:03:14.410> above<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.770> liver<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:16.080> just

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
up above the liver a little bit just

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.790 
up above the liver a little bit just
like<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.440> we<00:03:18.280> don't<00:03:18.459> need<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.760> pack<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.060> down

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
like that we don't need to pack it down

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.960 
like that we don't need to pack it down
because<00:03:20.800> when<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:20.980> screw<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.400> top<00:03:21.550> then<00:03:21.790> it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
because when we screw the top then it's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.340 
because when we screw the top then it's
going<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> pick<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.450> down<00:03:22.600> just<00:03:22.840> enough<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
going to pick it down just enough on the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.050 
going to pick it down just enough on the
time

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.240 

take<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> lid<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:29.620> just<00:03:29.800> pull<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.070> through

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
take the lid we just pull it through

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.540 
take the lid we just pull it through
there<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.040> need<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.280> tighten

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
there like that now we need to tighten

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.030 
there like that now we need to tighten
it<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:37.780> bit<00:03:37.930> we<00:03:38.709> don't<00:03:38.860> want<00:03:38.980> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it just a little bit we don't want to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.410 
it just a little bit we don't want to
over<00:03:39.340> tighten<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.090> we've<00:03:40.209> got<00:03:40.239> to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
over tighten it because we've got to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.000 
over tighten it because we've got to
remember<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:41.080> still<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.350> pressure<00:03:41.620> cooker

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
remember it's still a pressure cooker

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.280 
remember it's still a pressure cooker
but<00:03:42.790> tight<00:03:43.120> enough<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.870> we're<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.050> going<00:03:44.200> to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
but tight enough that we're not going to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.750 
but tight enough that we're not going to
have<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.470> overflow<00:03:44.980> coming<00:03:45.310> down<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.550> side

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
have that overflow coming down the side

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.330 
have that overflow coming down the side
here<00:03:45.790> now<00:03:46.620> we're<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.890> take<00:03:48.130> and
