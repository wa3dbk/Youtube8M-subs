00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.460
 fantastic and a bit combo 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.149
 sliced 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.780
 Welcome to tech like me 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 I'm quieter and I have here now 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
 dennis or 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.390
 and I wanted to ask like that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.420
 alienware finals are so far for him 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.290
 very well, though 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.730
 easy in the problems we are now 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 have fixed that works better 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.790
 hopefully you have the best 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.900
 maybe not seen in the case 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 I would not have guessed his 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.270
 but to have seen woman now 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.620
 and not before two will be today 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.000
 still a lot comes the next game 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.620
 By the way, that he gives me a loud bang when he's off 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 by the game is long socke socke 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.650
 against cloud the gorgeous kassel huskies 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.070
 is pretty horny and I can 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 recommend 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.980
 then we have two more best 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.690
 of three we have, among other things 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.580
 buddy against the measure will also 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 very good and of course the loser 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.000
 bracket finale is also very good times 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 who will play against it so will 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 quite a lot of people already today 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.320
 is still pretty early out of the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.940
 experience he knows that later 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.950
 seats are already full 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.330
 There are already some people standing if you are 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.640
 if you do not take it today you should 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.740
 be there tomorrow what do you mean who gets 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.410
 because now overall finale or grand 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.150
 final also that you are not so 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.500
 I believe that preached 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.080
 now then okay very good opportunities to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.910
 the bed is the mass in the loose bracket 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.530
 and then I'm downstairs so everything is open so 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.110
 really everything the east does not come like that 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.670
 good with the good is finally clear and 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.630
 Klaus proved that he has the mask 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.430
 can beat can then 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.260
 quite a good hit by that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.810
 which terraner provides in the final 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.580
 I do not care about playing 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.100
 So you're the one who favors him 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.280
 wins I think realistic objective 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.269
 observer of the very good chances in the 2 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.890
 but wins is something completely different 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.000
 because he could I think against the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.400
 Masses would have the biggest problems 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.080
 very big problem then i thank you 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.920
 like this short interview you have to yes 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.110
 to go back to work 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.890
 Well , thank you, William is as well as the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.209
 Suspension 1 against interview viva will 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.910
 i have god you are standing in the night 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.600
 car with can as together 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.100
 we'll probably be back in the car 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.989
 sleeping or one of our staff 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.580
 again slightly after the caution not 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.100
 again we are sorry in the car 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.950
 sleep time matches up against bad 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.060
 So here we will tap 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.530
 probably far after the car 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.570
 sleep if we have just a few more 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.340
 drink beer or the lord cyber 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.260
 network of kddi still going home 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.690
 So drive to me 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.520
 but somehow I think so 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.840
 40 go very well if you 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.150
 the find was demanded by the dance 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 a car is so little twingo and that 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.930
 is then a little wider ago 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.240
 that's it and there is someone else 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.960
 Other that 's it, how do you like it? 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.930
 that too far 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:45.310
 I like it very much so and me 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.660
 It's very cool and me 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.040
 also makes a lot of fun, even if it is 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.140
 a bit stressful with the videos 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.760
 upload and everything but actually one 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.370
 very cool eps finals of the dance fountain 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.570
 is a great location and we are breaking 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.500
 the interview now I think I 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.920
 wish you all a nice day 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.780
 still 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.980
 he likes to paint me 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.480
 I saw it so I hope you had 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.440
 Have fun in the interview of William 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.950
