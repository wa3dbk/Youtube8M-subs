00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:13.770
"speaker 1: My name is Fo.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.540
I'm a PhD student in Dr. Mao's lab.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.250
This is my fifth year here at Cornell University,
and one of the first project that I started

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.619
on, a protein that's related to a bacteria
called legionella pneumophila.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.670
This bacterium can get into a body through
contaminated aerosol.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.010
Once it is taken up by the macrophages the
bacteria can replicate in our cells, and eventually

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.280
take control over it.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.899
As a result it can lead to life threatening
pneumonia.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.790
It is called legionnaire's disease.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.000
United States alone, between 8,000 and 18,000
people are diagnosed annually.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.890
Once you get infected the fatality rate is
between 20 to 30 percent.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.190
So far there hasn't been a good drug that
specifically targeted this bacteria.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.860
Our research is to study legionella proteins
so we can develop better therapeutics to cure

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.100
this disease.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
My research career started much later.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.490
It was really after college.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.540
I grew up in, in Taiwan.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.010
As a kid I never thought of being a scientist.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.140
I wanna be a basketball player.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.530
And I came to the states in 1995.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.390
I'm always curious about bacteria.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.070
It really got me hooked.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.410
Look under the microscope that you can see
all these amazing living organism.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.180
After I graduated from University of Washington
I applied for a research technician position,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.820
and fortunately I was able to get the job,
and I worked for two years.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.210
I had a really good mentor.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.600
The field, my passion for science and really
gave me the confidence to apply to graduate

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.510
school, and the reason why I'm here at Cornell
University.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.620
I'm fortunate to be doing research at Weill
Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.149
This building is designed to allow for open
collaboration and communication among different

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.999
labs, so as a graduate student it is a privilege
to have this environment where you feel very

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:19.780
comfortable talking to a leading scientist
in their respective fields.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.260
To study bacterial protein you can actually
manipulate the bacteria to mass produce your

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140
protein and biochemically purify them.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.430
That process requires molecular cloning, growing
your bacteria cells in large quantity, and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.939
for me, a lot of discussion with my colleagues.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.550
The entire process can take up to one to two
months, but when you see your purified protein

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.300
it's amazing feeling and it really opens the
door for a lot of experiments by structural

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.560
biology approach, also cell biology.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.819
Right now I'm using mammalian cells to study
the role of proteins that are excreted by

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.819
legionella.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.190
Cells are typically preserved at below freezing
temperature.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.530
However, once they are thawed, they have to
be kept in a special incubator.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.819
Most of the experiments are performed in the
fume hood.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.389
The reason I use these cells are so I can
engineer a fluorescent tag to my protein and

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.889
use confocal microscope to look at exactly
where the protein's located inside the cell.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.209
In my first three years here I was interested
in protein structure.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.370
What I find fascinating about protein structure
is that you can figure out the, the shape

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.189
at the atomic level.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.269
The method that I use is called X-ray crystallography,
which requires protein crystals that are only

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.849
formed under very limited conditions, but
luckily there is a robot that helps with this.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.029
Once you see the crystal you can shoot X-ray
beam through it to obtain very useful structure

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.349
information, and using that the 3-dimensional
structure can be revealed."
