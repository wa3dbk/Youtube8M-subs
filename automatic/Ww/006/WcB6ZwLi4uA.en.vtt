00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.559
 unpredictable 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.599
 you confuse courage with exuberance 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.289
 I will not move you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.920
 Do you know where we are that is the earth 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the back of our ship is an emergency 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.550
 transmitter about 100 kilometers from here 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.990
 we have to save this station otherwise 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.280
 Let's die the temperatures on this 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.490
 planets are subject to dangerous 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490
 fluctuations 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.570

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:40.259

 we have to stop this mission 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 that would be small other people 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.400
 sake is not a human 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.400
 you are my son 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.420
 think about it is something real 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.900
 but fear is his decision 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.740
 if we want to survive 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.740
 we have to fight 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.989
