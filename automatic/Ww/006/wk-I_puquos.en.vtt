intensity<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:10.139> got<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:10.590> six<00:00:10.860> rows<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.429> cones

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
intensity we got here six rows of cones

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.970 
intensity we got here six rows of cones
it's<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> simulate<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.599> bag<00:00:12.900> okay<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
it's going to simulate a bag okay and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
it's going to simulate a bag okay and
this<00:00:14.309> drill<00:00:14.639> we're<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> place<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.599> down

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809

this drill we're going to place to down
a<00:00:15.839> little<00:00:16.109> bit<00:00:16.289> farther<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.010> let<00:00:17.730> ourselves

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
a little bit farther to let ourselves

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
a little bit farther to let ourselves
get<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.570> sprint<00:00:18.900> after<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.380> through

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
get out and sprint after we get through

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160 
get out and sprint after we get through
the<00:00:19.680> cones<00:00:20.420> this<00:00:21.420> drill<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:21.869> we're<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the cones this drill here we're going to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.929 
the cones this drill here we're going to
sprint<00:00:22.560> forward<00:00:22.859> we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> shuffle

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
sprint forward we're going to shuffle

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.920 
sprint forward we're going to shuffle
from<00:00:24.269> side<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> side

from side to side
I'll<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.470> about<00:00:25.560> half<00:00:25.769> speed<00:00:26.010> show<00:00:26.310> us<00:00:26.400> what

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I'll go about half speed show us what

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.950 
I'll go about half speed show us what
we're<00:00:26.640> doing<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.539> you're<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> give

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
we're doing here so you're going to give

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
we're doing here so you're going to give
it<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.109> shuffle<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> come<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it a shuffle you're going to come up to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
it a shuffle you're going to come up to
the<00:00:29.429> next<00:00:29.460> cone<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.929> get

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the next cone and we're gonna try to get

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.630 
the next cone and we're gonna try to get
some<00:00:31.199> where<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.309> Leonard

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
some where it's a little bit of Leonard

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
some where it's a little bit of Leonard
linear<00:00:33.180> lateral<00:00:33.960> movement<00:00:34.350> we're<00:00:34.469> trying<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
linear lateral movement we're trying to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
linear lateral movement we're trying to
work<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.700> he<00:00:35.850> gets<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> end<00:00:36.510> he's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
work on when he gets to the end he's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.020 
work on when he gets to the end he's
gonna<00:00:37.290> sprint<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:38.690> jog<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.870> back<00:00:40.050> here

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
gonna sprint it out jog on back here

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.180 
gonna sprint it out jog on back here
notice<00:00:42.030> he's<00:00:42.270> got<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> bands<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.860> reason

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
notice he's got the bands on the reason

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
notice he's got the bands on the reason
why<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.640> K<00:00:44.879> bands<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> use<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
why we use K bands is to use the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869 
why we use K bands is to use the
resistance<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.950> build<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> hip

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
resistance to build a little bit of hip

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
resistance to build a little bit of hip
strength<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.930> drive<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.500> leg<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.070> power

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
strength and drive our leg up with power

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
strength and drive our leg up with power
so<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> go

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so when we do these we're going to go

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
so when we do these we're going to go
about<00:00:52.620> six<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> eight<00:00:53.160> reps<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.670> resistance

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
about six to eight reps with resistance

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.520 
about six to eight reps with resistance
and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> move<00:00:55.289> down<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and then we're going to move down to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
and then we're going to move down to
four<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> six<00:00:56.430> without<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.510> start

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
four to six without to really start

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
four to six without to really start
working<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> lighter<00:00:58.949> feeling<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> our

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
working with the lighter feeling in our

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
working with the lighter feeling in our
legs<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.180> develop<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.629> speed<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.410> let's<00:01:01.559> go

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
legs and develop that speed so let's go

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
legs and develop that speed so let's go
ahead<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> couple<00:01:02.190> full<00:01:02.699> speed

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
ahead and go out a couple full speed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
ahead and go out a couple full speed
here<00:01:05.240> notice<00:01:06.240> he's<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.810> planting<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
here notice he's really planting on that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.440 
here notice he's really planting on that
outside<00:01:07.740> foot<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> he<00:01:09.000> gets<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> goes

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
outside foot and he gets out and goes

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.580 
outside foot and he gets out and goes
let's<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> quick<00:01:12.900> look<00:01:13.080> while<00:01:13.320> he<00:01:13.470> gets

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
let's take a quick look while he gets

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560 
let's take a quick look while he gets
back<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.330> position

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
back here when you get in this position

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
back here when you get in this position
you<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> balanced<00:01:17.369> low

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you want to be in a balanced low

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
you want to be in a balanced low
position<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.689> shuffle<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.979> get

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
position you're gonna shuffle as you get

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
position you're gonna shuffle as you get
to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> point<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.150> gonna<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to the point where you're gonna go the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
to the point where you're gonna go the
other<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.590> sure<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> good<00:01:23.280> base

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
other way make sure you get a good base

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
other way make sure you get a good base
and<00:01:23.549> stay<00:01:23.970> centered<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> leave<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> foot

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and stay centered if you leave this foot

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
and stay centered if you leave this foot
out<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:26.009> wide<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.000> gonna<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.330> able<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
out too wide you're not gonna be able to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
out too wide you're not gonna be able to
get<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.860> leave<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> too<00:01:29.340> close

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
get out and go if you leave it too close
