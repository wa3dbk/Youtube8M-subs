hit plateaus and plateaus happen but I'm
not<00:00:44.969> calling<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> plateau<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> only

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
not calling this a plateau this is only

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.049 
not calling this a plateau this is only
one<00:00:46.770> week<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.160> measurement<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:48.000> though

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
one week of measurement and even though

i<00:00:50.219> factor<00:00:50.610> into<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.969> sometimes<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.570> body

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
i factor into that sometimes your body

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.950 
i factor into that sometimes your body
retains<00:00:52.140> water<00:00:52.230> based<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> fidgety

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
retains water based on the fidgety

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.599

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
can be a factor in that plateau so don't

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
can be a factor in that plateau so don't
get<00:01:03.570> discouraged<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.500> getting
