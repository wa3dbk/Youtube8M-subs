00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this one is really short so the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
really like about the hair is that we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.850 
really like about the hair is that we
can<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.280> curl<00:03:09.060> patterns<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.319> on<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
can see the curl patterns are not on the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.160 
can see the curl patterns are not on the
same<00:03:11.069> level<00:03:11.370> which<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.299> really<00:03:12.720> nice<00:03:12.900> because

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
same level which is really nice because

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.160 
same level which is really nice because
it<00:03:13.500> makes<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.980> look<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.700> natural<00:03:15.239> because<00:03:15.930> if

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it makes it look so natural because if

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.390 
it makes it look so natural because if
you<00:03:16.260> look<00:03:16.440> at<00:03:16.590> your<00:03:16.799> if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.160> like<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you look at your if you have like a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.240 
you look at your if you have like a
Spanish<00:03:18.030> friend<00:03:18.420> or<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> friend<00:03:19.260> who<00:03:19.500> has<00:03:19.680> ultra

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
Spanish friend or a friend who has ultra

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.880 
Spanish friend or a friend who has ultra
curly<00:03:20.609> hair<00:03:20.850> their<00:03:21.540> curl<00:03:21.870> patterns<00:03:22.440> are<00:03:22.650> not

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
curly hair their curl patterns are not

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.530 
curly hair their curl patterns are not
on<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> same<00:03:23.370> level<00:03:23.430> unless<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.390> know

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
on the same level unless they you know

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170 
on the same level unless they you know
curl<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.769> know<00:03:25.920> twisted<00:03:26.790> their<00:03:26.940> hair

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
curl like you know twisted their hair

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.620 
curl like you know twisted their hair
but<00:03:28.130> naturally<00:03:29.130> your<00:03:29.489> curl<00:03:29.850> patterns<00:03:30.480> are

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
but naturally your curl patterns are

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.479 
but naturally your curl patterns are
gonna<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> different<00:03:31.620> level<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.310> that

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
gonna be a different level you see that

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.490 
gonna be a different level you see that
I<00:03:32.670> don't<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.660> explaining<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.319> right

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
I don't know if I'm explaining it right

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.330 
I don't know if I'm explaining it right
but<00:03:34.709> basically<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:36.590> segment<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.680> hair<00:03:38.010> is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
but basically this segment of hair is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.229 
but basically this segment of hair is
not<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.569> like<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.079> same<00:03:40.590> exact<00:03:41.519> curl<00:03:41.940> as

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
not really like the same exact curl as

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.979 
not really like the same exact curl as
this<00:03:42.480> one<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.980> gives<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.310> gives<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.810> some

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
this one so it gives it gives it some

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.180 
this one so it gives it gives it some
diversity<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.859> curls<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.900> don't<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:49.190> you

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
diversity in the curls I don't know you

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.970 
diversity in the curls I don't know you
can<00:03:50.370> see<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.660> lighting<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.170> really<00:03:52.530> poor

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
can see the lighting is really poor

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.240 
can see the lighting is really poor
sorry<00:03:53.639> about<00:03:53.850> them<00:03:54.319> don't<00:03:55.319> mind<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:55.620> nose<00:03:55.859> they

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.009 
sorry about them don't mind my nose they
won't<00:03:56.400> chop<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:57.239> not<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.690> point<00:03:57.959> right

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
won't chop that's not the point right

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.180 
won't chop that's not the point right
now<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.859> point<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.220> about<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.609> hair<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:01.190> see

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
now the point is about the hair so see

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.430 
now the point is about the hair so see
like<00:04:02.549> how<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.819> curls<00:04:03.780> are<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.049> different

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
like how the curls are in different

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.340 
like how the curls are in different
levels<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:05.069> don't<00:04:05.489> know<00:04:05.989> another<00:04:06.989> thing<00:04:07.319> I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
levels I don't know another thing I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.090 
levels I don't know another thing I
really<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.220> about<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.700> hair<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:10.100> the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
really like about this hair is that the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.560 
really like about this hair is that the
way<00:04:11.340> they<00:04:11.579> sewed<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.739> let<00:04:13.739> me<00:04:13.769> just

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
way they sewed it let me just

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.770 
way they sewed it let me just
show<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:17.380> see<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:18.300> that<00:04:19.300> little<00:04:19.510> loop

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
show you you see that that little loop

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.080 
show you you see that that little loop
right<00:04:19.989> there<00:04:20.110> it<00:04:20.560> goes<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:20.980> loop<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.489> that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
right there it goes like a loop in that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.270 
right there it goes like a loop in that
goes<00:04:22.300> like<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.510> then<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.650> comes<00:04:23.860> out<00:04:24.040> it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
goes like that then it comes out it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.200 
goes like that then it comes out it
really<00:04:24.730> tries<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.390> mimic<00:04:26.670> your<00:04:27.670> hairline

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
really tries to mimic your hairline

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.210 
really tries to mimic your hairline
because<00:04:28.510> most<00:04:28.780> wigs<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.320> get<00:04:29.470> those<00:04:29.710> straight

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
because most wigs you get those straight

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
because most wigs you get those straight
across<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.060> in<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.190> one<00:04:33.460> actually<00:04:33.730> tries

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
across so in but this one actually tries

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.960 
across so in but this one actually tries
to<00:04:34.720> mimic<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.610> hairline<00:04:37.920> when<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.070> loops<00:04:39.340> it

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
to mimic the hairline when it loops it

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.420 
to mimic the hairline when it loops it
goes<00:04:40.150> like<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.390> loop<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.860> out<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.310> then

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
goes like a loop in and out and then

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.960 
goes like a loop in and out and then
another<00:04:42.700> look<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.410> can't<00:04:44.410> really<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.980> don't

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
another look in can't really I don't

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.430 
another look in can't really I don't
know<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.180> can<00:04:46.330> see<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.050> see<00:04:47.260> how

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
know if you can see that but you see how

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.610 
know if you can see that but you see how
it<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:52.270> does<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.690> all<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.200> way<00:04:53.320> around

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
it is it does that all the way around

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.230 
it is it does that all the way around
and<00:04:54.280> see<00:04:54.670> if<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.910> can<00:04:55.120> make<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:56.070> clearer<00:05:00.240> it's

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
and see if I can make it clearer it's

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.690 
and see if I can make it clearer it's
really<00:05:01.510> hard<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.900> show<00:05:02.250> actually<00:05:03.250> give<00:05:03.520> me<00:05:03.670> a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
really hard to show actually give me a

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.950 
really hard to show actually give me a
second<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.330> have<00:05:04.570> my<00:05:04.720> map<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:09.720> sorry<00:05:10.720> about

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
second I have my map and sorry about

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.300 
second I have my map and sorry about
that<00:05:11.170> thought<00:05:11.380> I<00:05:11.440> was<00:05:11.620> prepared<00:05:11.980> for<00:05:12.190> this

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
that thought I was prepared for this

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.990 
that thought I was prepared for this
video<00:05:12.670> apparently<00:05:13.830> wasn't<00:05:14.830> appeared<00:05:15.370> as<00:05:15.700> I

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
video apparently wasn't appeared as I

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.890 
video apparently wasn't appeared as I
thought<00:05:16.420> I<00:05:21.840> want<00:05:22.840> this<00:05:22.990> baby<00:05:23.380> up<00:05:23.820> show<00:05:24.820> you

thought I want this baby up show you

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:38.450 
thought I want this baby up show you
what<00:05:25.900> are<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.110> talking<00:05:26.530> about<00:05:36.060> little<00:05:37.060> loops

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
what are we talking about little loops

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.120 
what are we talking about little loops
it's<00:05:39.460> not<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.640> dramatic<00:05:40.240> effect<00:05:40.600> but<00:05:40.980> it's<00:05:41.980> good

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
it's not a dramatic effect but it's good

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.370 
it's not a dramatic effect but it's good
enough<00:05:42.370> see<00:05:42.880> how<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.480> looks<00:05:43.660> like<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:44.110> peak

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
enough see how it looks like the peak

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.290 
enough see how it looks like the peak
almost<00:05:46.410> right<00:05:47.410> here<00:05:47.650> let's<00:05:48.640> back<00:05:48.850> up<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:49.180> little

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
ended up here we took look more

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.020 
ended up here we took look more
realistic<00:05:57.490> when<00:05:58.060> you<00:05:58.150> put<00:05:58.360> it<00:05:58.480> on<00:05:59.040> and<00:06:00.750> yeah<00:06:01.750> I

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
realistic when you put it on and yeah I

realistic when you put it on and yeah I
really<00:06:04.030> like<00:06:04.240> this<00:06:04.510> way<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.190> I'm<00:06:07.500> really<00:06:08.500> cold

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
I got this on 120 density however it is

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.890 
I got this on 120 density however it is
really<00:06:15.280> cool<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.760> I<00:06:15.880> like<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.330> layered<00:06:18.870> yeah<00:06:19.870> I
