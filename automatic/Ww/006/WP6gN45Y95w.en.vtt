00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.200 
one do you recommend Brad do you like
the<00:01:46.799> pelicans<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> pelican

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the pelicans or they like the pelican

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
the pelicans or they like the pelican
storm<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:49.649> can't<00:01:50.130> tell<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
storm I can't tell them about some of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
storm I can't tell them about some of
the<00:01:51.000> differences<00:01:51.570> again<00:01:52.380> one<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the differences again one of them is the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
the differences again one of them is the
latches<00:01:53.960> some<00:01:54.960> people<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:55.680> they're

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
latches some people like these they're

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
latches some people like these they're
probably<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.460> easier<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> open<00:01:57.030> than

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
probably a little easier to open than

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.319 
probably a little easier to open than
the<00:01:57.630> regular<00:01:57.960> Pelican<00:01:58.759> when<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.880> comes<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the regular Pelican when it comes to the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.260 
the regular Pelican when it comes to the
ultimate<00:02:00.479> heavy<00:02:01.049> duty<00:02:01.439> though<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.850> way<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
ultimate heavy duty though the way that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.980 
ultimate heavy duty though the way that
the<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.899> true<00:02:04.170> pelicans<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:05.869> constructed<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the the true pelicans are constructed I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
the the true pelicans are constructed I
probably<00:02:07.320> lean<00:02:07.439> towards<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.220> if

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
probably lean towards that if you're if

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.210 
probably lean towards that if you're if
you're<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.910> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.890> serious<00:02:10.890> about

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you're really going to go serious about

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.380 
you're really going to go serious about
protection

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
protection

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.890 
protection
so<00:02:14.160> again<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.790> Pelican<00:02:16.480> storm
