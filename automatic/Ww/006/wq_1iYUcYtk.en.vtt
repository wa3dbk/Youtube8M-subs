source of life biological life here is

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.039 
source of life biological life here is
the<00:00:13.500> Sun<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.670> sunlight<00:00:15.089> coming<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.780> matter

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the Sun the sunlight coming in to matter

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.269 
the Sun the sunlight coming in to matter
which<00:00:16.440> gives<00:00:16.680> us<00:00:16.830> our<00:00:17.039> form<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> moon<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
which gives us our form and the moon is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.990 
which gives us our form and the moon is
the<00:00:21.270> magnetic<00:00:21.660> energy<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.949> moon<00:00:23.220> rules<00:00:23.640> all

the waters on this planet the tides are

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609 
the waters on this planet the tides are
controlled<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> moon<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.660> controls<00:00:31.260> the

female cycle the fluids in our body our
bodies<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.730> magnetic<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.730> Sun

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
bodies are magnetic and so the Sun

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.020 
bodies are magnetic and so the Sun
whenever<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> Sun<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.680> moon<00:00:41.030> alignment

energy and at the full moon its maximum

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
energy and at the full moon its maximum
radiance<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:01.530> why<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.739> the

indigenous cultures always did the the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.380 
indigenous cultures always did the the
new<00:01:04.500> moon<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.159> full<00:01:05.430> moon<00:01:05.640> ceremonies

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
new moon and the full moon ceremonies

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
new moon and the full moon ceremonies
because<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.840> new<00:01:07.049> moon<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> plant<00:01:07.950> our

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
because the new moon is to plant our

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.929 
because the new moon is to plant our
seed<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> our<00:01:09.090> desire<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:11.360> receive<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.939> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
seed of our desire and receive it at the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.330 
seed of our desire and receive it at the
full<00:01:15.210> moon<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:16.049> work<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:19.189> receive<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
full moon not work at it receive it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
full moon not work at it receive it
everything<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.520> need<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.759> coming<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
everything we need is coming from this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.730 
everything we need is coming from this
light<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.250> open<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.939> receive<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
light if we can open to receive it and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
light if we can open to receive it and
so<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> moon<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.490> pouring<00:01:32.490> these

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
so the moon is like just pouring these

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.080 
so the moon is like just pouring these
loving<00:01:33.869> vibrations<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.009> maybe<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.759> can't

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
loving vibrations and maybe we can't

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660 
loving vibrations and maybe we can't
hear<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.650> open<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.490> our

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
hear them but if we open up with our

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
hear them but if we open up with our
breath<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.600> hold<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.320> attention<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:41.430> can

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
breath and hold our attention we can

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
breath and hold our attention we can
receive<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
receive them and the more we do that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
receive them and the more we do that
during<00:01:45.689> those<00:01:45.960> times<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.670> we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
during those times the more we

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.840 
during those times the more we
established<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.780> connection<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> whatever

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
established this connection so whatever

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
established this connection so whatever
we<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.960> open<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.340> receive<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.939> an

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
we can open up to to receive as an

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
we can open up to to receive as an
experience<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> allow<00:01:55.170> ourselves<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.890> feel<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
experience to allow ourselves to feel is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
experience to allow ourselves to feel is
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> expand<00:01:58.040> that's<00:01:59.040> how<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> works<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
going to expand that's how it works and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.330 
going to expand that's how it works and
it's<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> come<00:02:01.829> from<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> mind

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's not going to come from the mind

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.459 
it's not going to come from the mind
it's<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> come<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.049> thinking

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's not going to come from thinking

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
it's not going to come from thinking
about<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.920> okay<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> come<00:02:06.630> from

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
about it okay it's going to come from

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.800 
about it okay it's going to come from
opening<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.740> breathing<00:02:08.580> into<00:02:09.300> our<00:02:09.420> bodies

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
opening up breathing into our bodies

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.340 
opening up breathing into our bodies
connect

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
connect

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.680 
connect
with<00:02:10.560> nature<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:10.980> allowing<00:02:11.850> ourselves<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
with nature and allowing ourselves to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.280 
with nature and allowing ourselves to
have<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.590> new<00:02:13.920> experience<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
have a new experience and then that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.480 
have a new experience and then that
experience<00:02:17.100> gets<00:02:17.700> amplified
