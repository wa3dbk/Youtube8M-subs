right<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.070> working<00:02:56.370> now<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.730> think<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.330> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
right it's working now I think this is a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
right it's working now I think this is a
to<00:02:58.050> do<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> network<00:02:58.770> side<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.160> things

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to do with the network side of things

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.949 
to do with the network side of things
obviously<00:02:59.760> it's<00:02:59.910> going<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.180> getting<00:03:00.480> hit

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
obviously it's going to be getting hit

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.910 
obviously it's going to be getting hit
quite<00:03:01.260> hard<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.739> now<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.580> really<00:03:03.030> go<00:03:03.360> for

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
quite hard right now so I really go for

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.270 
quite hard right now so I really go for
the<00:03:04.920> dying<00:03:05.220> star<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.870> nice<00:03:07.260> red<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> cool

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the dying star so it's nice red and cool

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.060 
the dying star so it's nice red and cool
and<00:03:08.520> stuff<00:03:08.900> let's<00:03:09.900> hope<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:10.410> launch<00:03:10.800> me

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and stuff let's hope this will launch me

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.199 
and stuff let's hope this will launch me
in<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.550> see<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.850> quite<00:03:14.940> simple

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
in but as you can see it's quite simple

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.970 
in but as you can see it's quite simple
you<00:03:15.330> put<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> helmet<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.320> go<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.650> comes

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
you put on the helmet you go and comes

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.860 
you put on the helmet you go and comes
up<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.190> lot<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.430> dialogue<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.720> can

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
up a lot of dialogue and then you can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.449 
up a lot of dialogue and then you can
just<00:03:19.080> choose<00:03:19.440> which<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.100> want<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.340> go

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
just choose which one you want to go

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.120 
just choose which one you want to go
into<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.270> when<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.510> games<00:03:21.690> were<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.830> or

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
into I think when the games were more or

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.870 
into I think when the games were more or
the<00:03:23.400> arena<00:03:24.239> commanders<00:03:24.690> more<00:03:24.930> near<00:03:25.170> its<00:03:25.380> end

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
the arena commanders more near its end

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.750 
the arena commanders more near its end
or<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> beta<00:03:27.300> stage<00:03:27.660> or<00:03:28.050> close<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.770> release<00:03:29.040> it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
or a beta stage or close to release it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.960 
or a beta stage or close to release it
will<00:03:29.940> get<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.570> point<00:03:30.750> where<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.970> get

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
will get to the point where you can get

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.030 
will get to the point where you can get
in<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.750> take<00:03:33.959> out<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.890> can

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
in and then just take out you can

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.610 
in and then just take out you can
manually<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:36.090> open<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> doors<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.930> go<00:03:37.560> out

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
manually like open the doors and go out

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.949 
manually like open the doors and go out
the<00:03:37.800> hangar<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.280> fly<00:03:38.580> around<00:03:38.780> instead<00:03:39.780> of
