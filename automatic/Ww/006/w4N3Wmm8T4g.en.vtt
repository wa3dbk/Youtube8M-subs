21<00:01:01.590> SSD<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> overall<00:01:02.790> length<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
21 SSD I think the overall length is

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.510 
21 SSD I think the overall length is
getting<00:01:03.600> pretty<00:01:03.810> close<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> 30<00:01:04.500> feet<00:01:04.770> but<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
getting pretty close to 30 feet but I

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.780 
getting pretty close to 30 feet but I
think<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> body<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.870> tents<00:01:07.290> out<00:01:07.790> that's

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
think the body with the tents out that's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
think the body with the tents out that's
about<00:01:09.150> 21<00:01:09.600> feet<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> body<00:01:11.640> itself<00:01:12.150> looks<00:01:13.050> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
about 21 feet the body itself looks to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.200 
about 21 feet the body itself looks to
be<00:01:13.320> maybe<00:01:13.710> 15<00:01:14.340> or<00:01:14.610> 16<00:01:15.150> feet<00:01:15.180> long<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.760> think
