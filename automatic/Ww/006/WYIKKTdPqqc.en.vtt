right right yeah we did a crash this
morning<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.340> think<00:03:03.580> that's<00:03:03.849> probably<00:03:04.540> led

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
morning and I think that's probably led

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.839 
morning and I think that's probably led
to<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.470> bit<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.680> air<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> brake<00:03:06.370> so

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
to a little bit of air in the brake so

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.510 
to a little bit of air in the brake so
just<00:03:07.239> unfortunate<00:03:08.910> he<00:03:09.910> needed<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.300> track<00:03:10.540> time

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
just unfortunate he needed a track time

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.680 
just unfortunate he needed a track time
he's<00:03:12.520> getting<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> little<00:03:12.970> bit<00:03:13.150> closer<00:03:13.360> all<00:03:13.660> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
he's getting a little bit closer all the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.360 
he's getting a little bit closer all the
time<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.350> he's<00:03:14.560> written<00:03:14.800> here<00:03:15.040> before

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
time you know he's written here before

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.760 
time you know he's written here before
once<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.820> 125<00:03:16.480> but<00:03:17.440> being<00:03:18.280> new<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.820> 600<00:03:19.420> he

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
once I 125 but being new to the 600 he

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.020 
once I 125 but being new to the 600 he
needs<00:03:20.770> all<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.100> time<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.520> get<00:03:21.640> out<00:03:21.790> there

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
needs all the time we can get out there

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.350 
needs all the time we can get out there
sure<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.710> think<00:03:23.980> he's<00:03:24.520> droppin<00:03:24.940> every<00:03:25.210> time

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
sure so I think he's droppin every time

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.850 
sure so I think he's droppin every time
I<00:03:25.390> go<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.660> he's<00:03:25.990> dropping<00:03:26.350> quite<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> bit<00:03:26.740> of

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
I go out he's dropping quite a bit of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.730 
I go out he's dropping quite a bit of
time<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.460> i<00:03:27.490> think<00:03:27.940> tomorrow<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:29.350> know<00:03:29.500> which

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
time so i think tomorrow you know which

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.470 
time so i think tomorrow you know which
we<00:03:30.070> thought<00:03:30.280> coming<00:03:30.550> in<00:03:30.760> he<00:03:30.880> do<00:03:31.000> his<00:03:31.090> fastest

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
we thought coming in he do his fastest

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.180 
we thought coming in he do his fastest
lap<00:03:31.510> times<00:03:31.900> from<00:03:32.140> their<00:03:32.290> race<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.650> sunday<00:03:33.070> with

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
lap times from their race on sunday with

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.790 
lap times from their race on sunday with
more<00:03:33.400> experience<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> he<00:03:34.960> should<00:03:34.990> be<00:03:35.290> would

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
more experience so he should be would

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.950 
more experience so he should be would
expect<00:03:36.190> hopefully<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.880> get<00:03:37.030> into<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.480> 30s

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
expect hopefully to get into the 30s

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.550 
expect hopefully to get into the 30s
tomorrow

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
tomorrow

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.559 
tomorrow
hopefully<00:03:40.459> we<00:03:40.580> can<00:03:40.730> get<00:03:40.819> them<00:03:40.970> out<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.300> decent

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
hopefully we can get them out a decent

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.660 
hopefully we can get them out a decent
bike<00:03:41.989> with<00:03:42.260> no<00:03:42.410> right<00:03:42.830> problems<00:03:43.310> at<00:03:43.520> that

we come up with so that'll take a lot of
been<00:04:06.200> around<00:04:06.319> between<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.220> mechanics<00:04:07.700> in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
been around between the mechanics in

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.020 
been around between the mechanics in
between<00:04:08.349> DJ<00:04:09.349> and<00:04:09.380> surfer<00:04:10.250> us<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.489> come<00:04:10.640> up<00:04:10.760> with

between DJ and surfer us to come up with
this<00:04:11.600> always<00:04:11.900> going<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.170> be<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> compromise

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
this always going to be a compromise

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.190 
this always going to be a compromise
from<00:04:12.980> one<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.370> other<00:04:13.720> hopefully<00:04:14.720> try<00:04:15.049> and
