00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.390
 very good guys yesterday we upload a video 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.370
 about money and an application that you 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.049
 let's now tell what the 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.999
 which was doing a promotion that 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.530
 I was giving away batteries in this 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.969
 promotion or there were some things that did not 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.799
 they are too light and some 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.119
 you had doubts about that we're going to 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 solve today in the video 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.410
 and ham and it's a Spanish application 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.480
 totally free which is going to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.579
 allow to send and receive money 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 in a very simple way psuv or that 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.120
 you will all know paypal because ya money 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.579
 would be something similar but a 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.620
 adapted to mobile and much more 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.540
 quick and easy with this application 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.710
 They can request the money if 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.360
 example someday we have gone partying 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.160
 with some friends and they have paid us their 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.629
 part or have to pay us some coffee 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.339
 in this way I can request it and 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.900
 it's directly from the cell phone, it pays for it 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.940
 It is also great because we 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.320
 example we can link our card 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.000
 and then when it comes to paying no 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.769
 we would need to have to use in the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.479
 card but we will simply have to 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.790
 use the application and we will not have 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.770
 to give our card information and how 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.850
 You see, I had the video yesterday 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.710
 unfortunately for Latin America not 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.150
 It was this promotion but still you 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.010
 I recommend that you download the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.720
 application since it is very useful and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.549
 really can serve you now that 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.470
 we know a little better that it is already money 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.390
 and what is it for, let's clarify some 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.159
 doubts that arose yesterday first 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 let's talk about the theme of the card 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.360
 there were many people who did not trust 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.220
 the time to have to give a card already 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.540
 that will be a free gift that is 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 totally free we are going to do 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.870
 no type of charge 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.770
 we should give our card then the 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.660
 fact that we have to give the card 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.760
 it is simply a way to verify 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.380
 our account since good already puts and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.460
 will send us a physical product that 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.020
 it's a battery and that's obviously 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.880
 it costs money and it would be a way 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.010
 example of preventing a person then 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.420
 you create 65 accounts so as I say 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.770
 it would simply be a way of 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.900
 verification and they will charge us 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.280
 absolutely nothing anyway for 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.470
 that you do not trust below in the description 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 I will leave the bases of this promotion 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.710
 that has jack money that left them yesterday 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.330
 in a comment but good upload 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 we want to open seen all to leave 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.360
 also down then so that you throw him a 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.740
 eye and despite how I'm doing not 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.150
 they are going to charge us nothing I asked 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.250
 expressly to the person who 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.739
 contacted jacques money asking them 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 if you really did not do any kind of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.070
 charge and what he told me is that not that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.630
 that there was no kind of charge and 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.050
 it was only to verify the account 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.370
 OK 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.780
 he knew that these emails so that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.430
 you see that it is true I will be leaving 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.200
 around here also related to this 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 you will see that if you go to the promotion of 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.610
 'ham and make it is only 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 exclusive for movistar clients this 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.000
 it's not like that and as you can see if you look 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.890
 the date is not good either because it puts 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.870
 as the limit is February and we are in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.790
 April and is that they have made another 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.680
 promotion in which yes it was unique 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
 to movistar clients and they have made us 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.299
 promotion for android and then we 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.799
 have passed as conditions or as 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.780
 it was just like the promotion of 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.890
 movistar put it has passed the same vale 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.930
 but you can participate absolutely 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.939
 everyone also answers here the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 mail in which they tell me that it's not only 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.870
 to movistar and now we're going to the topic of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.939
 I send a lot of you asked me how 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.799
 they were going to send us the battery if I did not put 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.239
 is your address well then 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 finalize the entire process that you fulfill 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.019
 all the requirements and having 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.239
 filled out your form and add the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.579
 Card send you an email 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.930
 in which it takes them to a link where 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.819
 they ask for your data to 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.040
 send us the battery you are commenting 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.139
 that some of us did not get this email 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.819
 and therefore you are not giving any 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.169
 address so it is sent in the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.030
 If you have not received any 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.919
 mail that asks for the information to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.919
 send us the battery get in touch 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.720
 either with jan money or with me and 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.250
 good would be the doubts that arose and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.349
 I wanted to clarify a bit in the video 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.939
 since they stayed a little bit in the air and 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.680
 I hope that they have been clearer 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.079
 However, if you have any other questions or 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.519
 put any inconvenience arises 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.470
 under the comments and we will try 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.090
 answer it and good and regardless of 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.519
 theme of the application of ya 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.410
 I would like to comment something that is in 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.519
 relation to yesterday's video and that there was 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.650
 Many people, especially from Latin America 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.930
 that we took very well the fact that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.330
 was from Spain exclusively good is 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.280
 normal that you want them to do it too 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
 for your countries it is logical 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 totally but in this case as you 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.790
 I said it was not determined by me I did not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.620
 could change the basis of the draw as 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 you will know on my channel absolutely all 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.129
 the draws we have made have been 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.080
 totally international since a 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.819
 much of the public is out of 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.190
 Spain - and in fact they will follow 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.799
 being always but a lot of people started to 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.859
 put insulting comments to leave 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.419
 dislike etcetera had a lot of 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.310
 raffles and I have a lot of draws 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 international preparations but the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.000
 true that things like these are me 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.680
 they take away the desire to do these 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.300
 raffles already because the fact that there 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.010
 an extra promotion that is 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.720
 exclusively for spain I'm not 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.270
 removing any that is international 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.800
 I'm not adding more possibilities than 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.840
 in this case it is a giant for Spain 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.880
 but just another one of the day contacted me 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.560
 application that is only from mexico and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.000
 some promotion that is only for mexico 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.729
 is an example so in this respect 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.400
 all those people who commented malisse what 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.809
 it seems to me that you are a little selfish like that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.580
 as I tell you I have a lot of draws 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:54.729
 prepared as I told you smartphones 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.349
 xiaomei band among others I already had 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.759
 thought to get through the morning tests but 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.229
 how do I tell you things like these take away 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.819
 you get it a little bit so I'll see what 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.990
 I do so nothing this would be all 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.490
 remember that by following our 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.930
 twitter and facebook social networks and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.939
 download this application from the play store 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.030
 totally free is over we have a 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.030
 next a greeting 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.030
 Y
