where you like pounced the Beauty

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.350 
where you like pounced the Beauty
Blender<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> doesn't<00:01:16.430> fade<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.119> all

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
Blender so it doesn't fade well at all

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.230 
Blender so it doesn't fade well at all
it<00:01:18.689> fades<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.259> patches<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> fades<00:01:20.520> bad<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it fades in patches and it fades bad it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
it fades in patches and it fades bad it
oxidizes<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.350> patches<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.189> only<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
oxidizes in patches so not only is it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
oxidizes in patches so not only is it
fading<00:01:24.240> away<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.630> certain<00:01:24.930> areas<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.710> then

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.069 
quick review because it I was so excited
for<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.979> it's<00:03:32.979> a<00:03:33.069> good<00:03:33.189> shade<00:03:33.430> match<00:03:34.079> it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
for it and it's a good shade match it

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.949 
for it and it's a good shade match it
doesn't<00:03:35.379> break<00:03:35.590> me<00:03:35.769> out<00:03:35.799> but<00:03:36.790> applying<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.780> is

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
doesn't break me out but applying it is

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.319 
doesn't break me out but applying it is
awful<00:03:38.500> because<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:39.159> so<00:03:39.400> slippery<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.269> it

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
awful because it is so slippery and it

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.819 
awful because it is so slippery and it
doesn't<00:03:40.659> absorb<00:03:40.780> into<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.199> skin<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.650> think

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
doesn't absorb into the skin I think

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.050 
doesn't absorb into the skin I think
that's<00:03:41.979> my<00:03:42.129> main<00:03:42.280> point<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.579> want<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.790> make<00:03:42.909> is

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
that's my main point I want to make is

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.629 
that's my main point I want to make is
that<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.269> doesn't<00:03:43.629> absorb<00:03:43.810> into<00:03:44.229> the<00:03:44.349> skin<00:03:44.639> it

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
that it doesn't absorb into the skin it

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.699 
that it doesn't absorb into the skin it
takes<00:03:45.939> so<00:03:46.180> long<00:03:46.509> it<00:03:46.780> takes<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.229> much<00:03:47.409> work<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
takes so long it takes so much work to

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.759 
takes so long it takes so much work to
blend<00:03:48.189> it<00:03:48.340> into<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.579> skin<00:03:48.669> and<00:03:49.150> buff<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
blend it into the skin and buff it and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.649 
blend it into the skin and buff it and
make<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.919> lines<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.609> away<00:03:51.639> and<00:03:52.180> make<00:03:52.359> sure<00:03:52.540> you

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
make the lines go away and make sure you

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.539 
make the lines go away and make sure you
have<00:03:52.780> even<00:03:53.049> coverage<00:03:53.439> everywhere<00:03:53.889> it's<00:03:54.159> so

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
have even coverage everywhere it's so

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.729 
have even coverage everywhere it's so
hard<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:55.599> much<00:03:55.780> work<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.199> then<00:03:56.620> it

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
hard it's so much work and then it

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.949 
hard it's so much work and then it
oxidizes<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.669> patches<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.449> fades<00:03:58.750> in

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
oxidizes and patches and it fades in

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.659 
oxidizes and patches and it fades in
patches<00:03:59.169> and<00:03:59.590> those<00:03:59.739> two<00:03:59.979> patches<00:04:00.220> are<00:04:00.459> never

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
patches and those two patches are never

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.759 
patches and those two patches are never
the<00:04:00.849> same<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.239> your<00:04:01.389> face<00:04:01.629> and<00:04:01.930> then<00:04:02.530> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
the same on your face and then the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.379 
the same on your face and then the
places<00:04:03.159> where<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.430> would<00:04:03.519> expect<00:04:03.879> it<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.090> fade

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
places where you would expect it to fade

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.649 
places where you would expect it to fade
in<00:04:04.659> your<00:04:04.780> t-zone<00:04:05.169> it<00:04:05.349> stays<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.030> maybe<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.389> you

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
in your t-zone it stays so maybe if you

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.199 
in your t-zone it stays so maybe if you
are<00:04:07.689> like<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.259> grease<00:04:08.590> monkey<00:04:08.970> everywhere<00:04:09.970> on

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.479 
are like a grease monkey everywhere on
your<00:04:10.239> face<00:04:10.689> you<00:04:11.290> might<00:04:11.439> have<00:04:11.739> less<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.400> a
