00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
January 2010 when I realized that the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.769 
January 2010 when I realized that the
relaxers<00:00:18.170> were<00:00:18.410> taking<00:00:18.980> my<00:00:19.130> hair<00:00:19.460> out<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:19.910> can

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
relaxers were taking my hair out you can

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.710 
relaxers were taking my hair out you can
see<00:00:21.110> I<00:00:21.590> am<00:00:22.040> beginning<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:22.520> ball<00:00:22.970> in<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.480> center

see I am beginning to ball in the center
and<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:24.560> starting<00:00:24.890> to<00:00:24.920> thin<00:00:25.250> out<00:00:25.630> around<00:00:26.630> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
and it's starting to thin out around it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.380 
and it's starting to thin out around it
I<00:00:27.169> think<00:00:27.950> in<00:00:28.040> the<00:00:28.130> next<00:00:28.430> like<00:00:28.610> two<00:00:28.910> years<00:00:29.210> I

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
I think in the next like two years I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.540 
I think in the next like two years I
probably<00:00:29.689> will<00:00:29.900> be<00:00:30.020> bald<00:00:30.290> now<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:31.340> is<00:00:31.520> a

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550
