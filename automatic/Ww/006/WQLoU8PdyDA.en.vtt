00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.340
 time for call of duty transporter 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.530
 the ps4 as every day 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.900
 it is the weekend there is call of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.889
 duty black ops 2 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 and yes we will graduate now 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.230
 confirmed play we take times the m1 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.340
 irons again with a knife yes we have to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.340
 collect brands 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.890
 We will now brand as well 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.890
 collecting returnable bottles 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:43.370
 no boni no more thank god came 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:56.930
 the team members that was me already 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 left death I have not seen anything I have 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.230
 just shot 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.150
 yes at the time of recording so where 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.500
 the result did not take the second run 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.280
 but when the sequel appears 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.530
 we already in the middle of the e3 in it and me 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.630
 personally expect a lot of times to look 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 Above all, I expect what will come 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.310
 that sony times her virtual glasses 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.350
 but I also expect titles 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.830
 which have not yet been announced 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.180
 that's just such a world premiere so 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.240
 not world-premiere gameplay or 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.890
 but a world premiere of titles that 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.710
 be announced and I expect that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.690
 in call of duty black ops three times 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.560
 Properly show in the gameplay material 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.099
 We also mention things changed 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 may have stop for example 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.759
 from the community of players cd 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.780
 gamblers 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.550
 were criticized or if it was again 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.649
 it will be five minutes of gameplay material 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.250
 the best call of duty of all time 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.099
 every call of duty whatever appears 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 if the man was the weapon and that was it 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.830
 then too 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.600
 So this standard is the best call 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.180
 of Duty become the latest technology 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.630
 and finally it feels like 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.630
 every call of duty on the topic story 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:39.940
 yes overland damn thing 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.290
 I like the e3 wood part man 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.000
 Do not have to go there any more 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.900
 I want to play him out of his man, though 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 you have to remember 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.830
 the game time will not be like this either 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.720
 be long I think you can play there 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.540
 four times really what right 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.579
 journalists and not the whole people 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 the as are most of all about 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.190
 to gamble or anything so it's 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 really what journalists she stops 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.390
 also report about it and not 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.390
 only i want i have played great 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.680
 I do not know if I have anything to do 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.680
 theme to do it 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.760
 3 g unit news you can all be 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.900
 View presentations on the internet 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.850
 even the highlights would be times 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.880
 watch or the live streams 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.700
 Of course, watch the time 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.350
 for example, at three o'clock in the morning is the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.350
 sony press conference or was 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.440
 mist mist mist if seen here higher 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.440
 fenced are given a total 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.990
 what a mess full of men with 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.410
 that's why you should go out of rome and 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:15.740
 then kill each one from behind in the middle 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:17.720
 or say from here almost the outside way 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:27.050
 Here the draftsman will come I feel 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:29.350
 that nobody will come I will pursue 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.730
 already or I have a few times already 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.950
 press conferences are what keeps me going 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.820
 it is exciting that they are just that 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.270
 triple agent marianne so title the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.540

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.550

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.540
 with things so that on any 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.640
 wants to know 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.590
 these for example this in the 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 Developer games or soya are 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.920
 Although beautiful, perhaps, are the most 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.250
 good but you are there or sometimes pursued 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.690
 the competition just because you just great 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:11.570
 duper everything from the latest call of 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:16.040
 wants to see duty and not somehow like that 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.390
 a game what 5000 people buy my 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.220
 old game what people do not 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.780
 Interested where you can see that there 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.850
 not the latest technology behind 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.950
 because I want the latest from the latest 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.639
 I want to stop this blockbuster 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.159
 see title 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.620
 then it's like star wars and 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.120
 documentation who wants a documentary 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.840
 if there is anything new about it 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.580
 star wars gives as an example the two 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.930
 latest star wars movie probably a doku 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.110
 about no idea 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.539
 turtles though here I am impulsive 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.680
 it would not be then 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.939
 we are it was the next time the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.550
 not so great now 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.909
 the beginning, but above all, let's see what 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.909
 tomorrow is coming
