00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.490

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.440
 I go home in jazz and 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.299
 others because I had especially for all 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.289
 new attack on crash of plant but 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.240
 first of all I'd like to do a little 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.130
 dedication to baptist to see the little 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.779
 dedication to you Baptist and now 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.710
 it's gone for the attack descends mignot 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.270
 the bike 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.789
 so here I just found a 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.470
 village with 100000 each of elixir 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.560
 like for gold so let's go for 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.599
 an attack of 200 million on 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.879
 assets and property or even country reservoir 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.460
 so 3 2 1 and it's gone 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.260
 so I'm already going to see times felt 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.840
 no one's the one so I'll attack 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:52.640

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.160
 still one here not so it's beautiful ya not 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.780
 There is no trap, nothing is that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.190
 that I really wanted to see so that's 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 for that I put a little everywhere 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.140
 so here we go, I send them by 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.100
 group so it's gone it's gone 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.180
 anti-air defense 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.180
 we will expose it 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.649
 the castle of caen so already there had 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.860
 nothing in it luckily they had 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:18.080
 no archers brawl and defense 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 anti-aircraft already ali plus then the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.320
 mortar 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.500

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.760

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.610

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.960

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.830
 no now it's not going to do it okay 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.330
 not do it there is the tower darche and there 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.290

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:35.170
 hut and to the body he'll go where the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:39.690
 here on the hut wipo hawks fun 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:45.420
 it is true that the cabin is nevertheless 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 goodbye to the censor tower okay 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.900
 good then win anyway on the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.220
 blood what more than a hundred thousand 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.820
 attentions are 1000 and dust 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.650
 hundred thousand 100 1 1000th 34 with them gold 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.660
 so of the more than 41 1394 of elixir and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.510
 finally to not find with a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.550
 bonus of 3300 in elixir as well as in gold 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.900
 so it's still yes it's not bad 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.950
 like attac is what you need to know 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.730
 also it is that at the beginning 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.560
 if I put one here at that point it's 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.360
 really to avoid I take them 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.640
 cities the minions a cute there a 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.330
 cute there it was really to avoid 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.850
 in fact the attacks of two the traps 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.190
 rather anti-aircraft defenses and 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.950
 its support of wind turbine traps so 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.200
 it was really to avoid that more 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.880
 it also saves you from losing 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.420
 troops by package of weapons if you say 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.010
 to go hop 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.190
 I attack the roma hi to send you 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.530
 10 15 troops and there in one fell swoop 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.430
 a trap at thierry a bar goodbye to 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.800
 see again so that's why it's 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.959
 better morning teeth there like that that you 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.290
 avoids losing big packages of 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.180
 troops 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.650
 here is so do not hesitate always to me 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.329

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.650
