implemented this thing called the speed

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
implemented this thing called the speed
pocket<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> does<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> makes<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

are<00:01:10.500> forgiving<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> point<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
are forgiving to the point where if you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
are forgiving to the point where if you
hit<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.770> bit<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> heel<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
hit it on a little bit to the heel you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
hit it on a little bit to the heel you
can<00:01:14.880> still<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.360> shot<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.780> little<00:01:16.110> bit

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
can still get a good shot a little bit

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
can still get a good shot a little bit
to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> toe<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.189> still<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.820> shot

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to the toe you'll still get a good shot

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
to the toe you'll still get a good shot
but<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:19.049> ends<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:20.189> club<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> goes

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
but it ends there this club kind of goes

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
but it ends there this club kind of goes
beyond<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.869> hit<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.920> hit<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
beyond so if you hit it if you hit it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.200 
beyond so if you hit it if you hit it
thin<00:01:23.430> you'll<00:01:24.000> still<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.659> shot<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
thin you'll still get a good shot and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
thin you'll still get a good shot and
like<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.420> hit<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> couple<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.320> thin<00:01:28.470> shots<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
