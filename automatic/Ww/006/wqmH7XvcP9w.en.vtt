this guy here and I'm I'm gonna die in a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
minute I think I can't get out the way

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:37.120 
minute I think I can't get out the way
of<00:03:19.670> him<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.290> he's<00:03:21.440> quite<00:03:21.680> annoying<00:03:21.980> ah

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.920 

ah<00:03:38.260> I'm<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.440> red<00:03:39.770> alert<00:03:39.800> here

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.300 

so<00:03:45.590> we're<00:03:45.680> going<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.859> try<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.540> knock<00:03:47.540> him<00:03:47.750> out

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.230 

it's<00:03:54.310> probably<00:03:54.430> why<00:03:54.610> she's<00:03:54.910> done<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
it's probably why she's done in the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:04.110 
it's probably why she's done in the
first<00:03:55.420> place<00:04:01.230> okay<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:03.490> if<00:04:03.550> we<00:04:03.670> gained<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:04.000> bit

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
first place okay so if we gained a bit

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:18.729 
first place okay so if we gained a bit
of<00:04:04.240> energy<00:04:04.360> after<00:04:05.070> nearly<00:04:06.070> copy<00:04:06.490> now

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.570 

ok<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:19.609> we<00:04:19.940> are<00:04:20.090> finally<00:04:20.120> up<00:04:21.310> after<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> bit<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
ok so we are finally up after a bit of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.430 
ok so we are finally up after a bit of
bit<00:04:23.389> of<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.539> nightmare<00:04:23.720> trying<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.229> get<00:04:24.349> up

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440
