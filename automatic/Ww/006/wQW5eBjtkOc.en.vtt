00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 so here and good morning everyone 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.310
 today a new little video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.740
 so as I say in the announcement the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.120
 first survival video I specify that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'm all these videos there I'm going 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570
 do it already in my garden most 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.769
 are normal garden that he is tall and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.000
 I have a kind of little wood at the bottom 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 or in other places 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.199
 it will see me well so today we have 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.230
 hungry will take how to make a call is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.600
 simple to catch animals I 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 precise well could ski trap and everything 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.529
 really is that in case of survival does not 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 you not have fun now do jsba 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 trap to catch rabbit to ask them 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 anywhere in a field all forgotten 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.250
 your trap and that 's it even though 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.660
 you catch a rabbit that you go in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.860
 do you do not have to eat it since 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 you are not in case of a mouse that me 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.649
 I really think I advise you 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 to really do it only in case of survival 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 it's otherwise it's useless here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 so I'm going to start by asking so 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 the two so we have here down I have 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.890
 recovered my shoelace is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.649
 alain well I put them after for 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.920
 to make the collar of small pieces of wood 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.750
 for meters on each side to be able to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 keep the collar and pieces of wood 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.400
 mainly that that he was worthy 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.530
 jo to keep the collar 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.930
 so already my mast me I can not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 look for the log forest gives us 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.200
 finally a passage of animals so the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 often you will see it's more 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 trampled by a place even in 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 tall grass or often near 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 streams 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
 always follow in the water if 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.479
 possible and at the edge of a stream will be 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.670
 always paths that cross 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 shred the right to the left we're you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.430
 put it stick in a way not to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 right or left 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.790
 that's not right at the intersection of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 social streets will fall in the creek 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 so a little bit before and that's so I'm going 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 lay the two main stakes and I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 find you after that so here are the two 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.850
 stakes that will serve to maintain the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 stick on the spot and so then we go 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 place the main stake so the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.689
 since she has it so we will put it to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 about here to maintain the collar 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.840
 I took white you can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.649
 take on black prices because 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.939
 it's discreet 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.430
 you go there for example of pageantry 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.600
 rope but that's possible if you 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.159
 go on a hike but you 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.049
 do not know exactly you're going so 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.420
 like me I do it often and I 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.220
 do not know at all take a little two 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.970
 Smiles frankly that's going to serve the age 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.440
 where my feeling of surville but good 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.930
 what with a survival kit of me I 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.760
 a knife joke wheels puts in I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.870
 put a survival kit with what 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.880
 to prevent quite frankly you rest 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.180
 very useful so here we have to 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.990
 childhood and britt yens and then we go 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 place the college 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.830
 so I take you back once 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.970
 college so here's to paste it you 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.760
 do it like that with a loop 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.200
 so a simple game and then for the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.660
 master you pass so the ati stream it 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.670
 and so wait sorry that's for the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.740
 strap here so like this so in 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.450
 after you pull 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.260
 and here and there it makes you angry 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.040
 I do not place myself and after we will do a test 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.780
 is there right now 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400
 so I sticked up so I 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.400
 I'm not going to exactly go freeze here I am 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.750
 a little fast so here I handed the collar 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.980
 is there on it so on the path of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.240
 toral toxic way she does not 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.430
 will inevitably trigger that for sure 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.550
 so there it is pretty much for a rabbit 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.540
 or a fox and then I read them here 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.320
 document existed a lot of the scene 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.690
 since finally I was in need 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.280
 meters from there it's good so here are the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.750
 connect to the stake so we will make a 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.970
 little demonstration so proof it's 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.750
 that I do not have the arm long enough but good 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
 the animal passes it takes and once 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.320
 they leave 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.090
 he will pull on the collar and his greenhouse 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.410
 around the wrist or if I'm struggling 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.320
 so in difficult times really one in 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.260
 done if I say bah it serves me more 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.360
 in addition and there he can go there so 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.070
 I'll hand it is my second 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.090
 test so I got up a little bit more 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.250
 like this so wait two minutes to 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.570
 have always connected her so I got 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.650
 put a little shorter so the animal 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.280
 going on like these he's going ahead and he's 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.030
 tight and there he can more bared here by 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.030
 whatever I happen to remove 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.070
 hear from second to flat so here is the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.390
 that's how to make a call is simple 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.370
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.260
 more and the next video I will do 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.370
 that's how to make fire so with 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.690
 an entire object that shines no for me 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.950
 I took a magnifying glass you can you can 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.410
 take part here I respect you the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.070
 same day so see next video 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.070
 go
