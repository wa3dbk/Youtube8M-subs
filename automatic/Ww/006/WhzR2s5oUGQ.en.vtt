00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
out heavily zoom in for a little bit

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.000 
out heavily zoom in for a little bit
anyway<00:04:51.160> so<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.600> was<00:04:53.110> worried<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.590> I'd<00:04:53.860> be

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
anyway so I was worried that I'd be

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.910 
anyway so I was worried that I'd be
collecting<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.550> whole<00:04:54.820> lot<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.540> land<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.410> it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
collecting a whole lot of land and it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.320 
collecting a whole lot of land and it
would<00:04:57.010> be<00:04:57.130> pressing<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.640> against<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.060> phone

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
would be pressing it against the phone

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.570 
would be pressing it against the phone
now<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.110> had<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.710> in<00:04:59.770> my<00:04:59.890> pocket<00:04:59.920> for<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.340> couple

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
now I had it in my pocket for a couple

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.890 
now I had it in my pocket for a couple
days<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:01.000> yesterday<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.420> took<00:05:01.540> it<00:05:01.720> all<00:05:01.810> apart

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
days and yesterday I took it all apart

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.110 
days and yesterday I took it all apart
and<00:05:02.970> there<00:05:03.970> wasn't<00:05:04.210> much<00:05:04.450> lent<00:05:04.690> in<00:05:04.870> there<00:05:05.110> and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
and there wasn't much lent in there and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.700 
and there wasn't much lent in there and
because<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.330> little<00:05:07.570> plastic<00:05:08.140> railing

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
because of that little plastic railing

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.950 
because of that little plastic railing
it<00:05:09.070> actually<00:05:09.790> prevents<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.360> from<00:05:10.450> directly

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
it actually prevents it from directly

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.800 
it actually prevents it from directly
hugging<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.980> phone<00:05:12.280> dead<00:05:12.970> on<00:05:13.180> like<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.720> was

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
hugging the phone dead on like it was

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.810 
hugging the phone dead on like it was
kind<00:05:14.200> of<00:05:14.260> loose<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.890> about<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.400> more<00:05:15.640> so

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
kind of loose and about and more so

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.030 
kind of loose and about and more so
stuck<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.330> inside<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.930> as<00:05:17.200> opposed

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
stuck to the inside of this as opposed

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.380 
stuck to the inside of this as opposed
to<00:05:18.130> touching<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.490> phone<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.060> was<00:05:19.270> actually

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
to touching a phone so I was actually

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.910 
to touching a phone so I was actually
pleasantly<00:05:19.690> surprised<00:05:20.260> about<00:05:20.410> that<00:05:20.470> so

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
pleasantly surprised about that so

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.560 
pleasantly surprised about that so
anyway<00:05:21.880> I'm<00:05:21.940> just<00:05:22.060> kind<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.210> showing<00:05:22.390> you
