this<00:00:13.400> will<00:00:13.700> fast<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.060> big<00:00:14.210> fat<00:00:14.390> gum<00:00:14.600> tree<00:00:14.810> on

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
this will fast that big fat gum tree on

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
this will fast that big fat gum tree on
the<00:00:15.020> right<00:00:15.170> there<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:15.530> we're<00:00:15.620> going<00:00:15.740> to<00:00:15.830> turn

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
the right there and we're going to turn

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.490 
the right there and we're going to turn
into<00:00:16.130> the<00:00:16.280> river<00:00:16.870> so<00:00:17.870> when<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.050> go<00:00:18.140> into<00:00:18.290> it

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
into the river so when you go into it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.020 
into the river so when you go into it
just<00:00:18.620> aim<00:00:19.100> for<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.370> center<00:00:19.700> and<00:00:19.730> stay<00:00:19.910> in<00:00:19.970> the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
just aim for the center and stay in the

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.920 
just aim for the center and stay in the
middle<00:00:20.710> get<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:21.800> speed<00:00:22.040> up<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.340> five<00:00:22.940> count<00:00:23.240> 12

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
middle get you speed up to five count 12

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.390 
middle get you speed up to five count 12
K's<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.440> then<00:00:24.529> just<00:00:24.680> keep<00:00:24.800> it<00:00:24.950> steady<00:00:25.100> all<00:00:25.310> the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
K's and then just keep it steady all the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.250 
K's and then just keep it steady all the
way<00:00:25.490> through<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:26.029> mean<00:00:26.750> we<00:00:26.900> know<00:00:27.050> there's

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
way through I mean we know there's

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.280 
way through I mean we know there's
nothing<00:00:27.500> in<00:00:27.590> here<00:00:27.770> but<00:00:28.689> yeah<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:29.960> just<00:00:30.140> take<00:00:30.259> it

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
nothing in here but yeah so just take it

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.800 
nothing in here but yeah so just take it
slightly<00:00:30.560> why<00:00:30.830> do<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.550> big<00:00:31.730> s<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.180> then<00:00:32.570> just

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
slightly why do a big s and then just

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.110 
slightly why do a big s and then just
imagine<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:33.710> white<00:00:33.860> line<00:00:34.100> down<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.370> river<00:00:34.880> just

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
imagine a white line down the river just

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.099 
imagine a white line down the river just
drive<00:00:35.329> down

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109

under<00:00:42.989> 20<00:00:43.260> KS<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.739> fishery

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
under 20 KS this fishery

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
under 20 KS this fishery
but<00:00:46.380> they're<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.800> make<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.130> little<00:00:47.340> bit<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
but they're to just make a little bit of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
but they're to just make a little bit of
a<00:00:47.640> bow<00:00:47.790> wave<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.240> PISA<00:00:48.510> study<00:00:49.070> will<00:00:50.070> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a bow wave the PISA study will be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.020 
a bow wave the PISA study will be
quicker

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
quicker

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.619 
quicker
oh<00:00:52.090> yeah

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

and<00:01:27.079> we're<00:01:27.200> great<00:01:27.409> city<00:01:27.770> bed<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.399> waters

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
and we're great city bed and the waters

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.760 
and we're great city bed and the waters
high<00:01:29.000> opinion

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
high opinion

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.929 
high opinion
we<00:01:31.310> go<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.579> 700<00:01:32.270> mill<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.079> because<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.979> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
we go to 700 mill so because of it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.249 
we go to 700 mill so because of it
that's<00:01:36.359> why<00:01:36.509> we've<00:01:36.719> got<00:01:36.749> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:36.990> button

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that's why we've got a little button

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.590 
that's why we've got a little button
here<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.530> rings<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.890> waves<00:01:38.069> on<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:39.299> turns

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
here with rings for waves on it it turns

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.209 
here with rings for waves on it it turns
off<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> electronics<00:01:40.499> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> engines<00:01:41.069> or

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
off the electronics of the engines or

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.120 
off the electronics of the engines or
the<00:01:41.249> water<00:01:41.460> doesn't<00:01:41.759> affect

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.770
