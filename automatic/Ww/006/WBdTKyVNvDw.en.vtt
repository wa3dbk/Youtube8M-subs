00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.389
 surely the duo percent have something 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.299
 too often with the opponents approximately 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.110
 for Gregor Pötscher percent US cheated good money 0 15 but I think 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.329
 10 kiltz 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.599
 I, on the other hand, somehow have six tracks, especially since I always have 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.710
 took 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.800
 there must still be some for my ass now Uni 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.230
 and like Berlin and so next round we are now 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.820
 k and that guys are terrorism warning you restart in ten seconds and now 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520
 People 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.280
 Dr forget 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 SK Sweden is now percent 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.670
 printed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.030
 Closer to the US to stay 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 Do not always make voices on the world at all 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.990
 directly to the bomb place look at me quickly skating on a run up run up 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.789
 serious 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.789
 Arri center the vehicles 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 OK 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 Get her Tiger 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 I have it again, it's easy 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 This boy I do not do everything alone 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 I have him unloved 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.230
 Okoro PLO 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.290
 Loßmann 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 lack of something also shows people to be that I can 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.000
 there 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 and I certainly have another plan but sustained pressure by the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 our safety 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.400
 undercut 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 says what does Maas say? 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 with a little luck 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 define by means of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 ten pieces of what she did not say what only mothers said 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.340
 that means almost a bit of exile 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 you did not put only in the middle said 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.249
 Kaymer himself likes 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.459
 in doing so you set on 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.259
 agree on the tactics 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.699
 just wins 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
 Le Bon 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.309
 Dr Voldemort after the first shock ContiTech from Kiel afterwards 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.929
 it is percent 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.929
 unbelievably incredible I know dabbed 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.909
 one rushes the percent the Russian opening 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.419
 Regards it is a show a lot of happy opening from behind 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.709
 October 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.709
 STS Dr 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 Freshness greets to be sold 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.449
 okay i think our tactics are not going to market 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.759
 but they have not put the bomb yet that's good 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.399
 That's good 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 he gets now 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.409
 some a nice way that I'm percent 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.159
 and counter-strike not so wrong always i really like the game yes i have 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.039
 like 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.889
 I canceled why do we actually counter-strike you down 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.579
 me 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.889
 Vale Fitz 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.889
 so i like real good idea now 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.889
 is the number back on Necker flannel with 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.349
 Prok OK 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.349
 the small 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.359
 Herbal dwarfs 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 I stopped fighting between troops 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.669
 so headstrong Bangkok a bit perplexed 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.749
 I had hoped a bit often that the market outlines it again 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.039
 but not worked 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.700
 5 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.140
 I was surprised normally it is always out of the market 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.389
 that can be too 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.120
 as I am with me trust that but we can also have a case tactic 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.870
 will that we just hide somehow and the and seek field 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 So look for ours and I put the bomb 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 rightly 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.710
 St 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.699
 I think they are yes it just looks like they are getting better that's easy 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.430
 they have to be here if I have to go to the place again 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.389
 all of him or her not in the spotlight of me burns the director 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.580
 the cameraman who shot Down with their more after that gummy bears 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.410
 In addition, mine has my shoes and together there are at least ten 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.410
 soldered to the step assistance 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.930
 I could call it on the spot 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.930
 why we are the better team after all 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 Bobo Potro 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.029
 you have to have him, I have certainly met ten times 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.659
 Ohletz last round after where percent 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.710
 short 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.710
 ste 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.550
 I have 10 I have new tactics 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.409
 Let's take the fair 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.229
 then we think we have bad weapons 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.990
 close to Enn ze 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.990
 given five moves 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.879
 FP 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.259
 Dreaming makes it incredibly fun to try 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:58.700
 it out 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.310
 in the songs songs
