 add momentum diminishing 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.689

 weighs wires have 4 razomchik and for 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:51.619

 the computer case itself is a box under 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.689
 two and a half that is, you can instead 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 put in place of the staff there 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.280
 card reader or some other nonsense 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.930
 old cases instead of a floppy disk drive 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.650

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.260
 bundled lay 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.459
 The wolves did not first notice the fasteners 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.560
 importantly lan well they are so on 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.220
 it's all connected 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.720
 also number 1 first 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 rheostat u zalmanovskie to the second 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.790
 third 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.660
 third and fourth so he disconnected 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.870
 standard computer power supply 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:15.410
 let's cut the green black plug there 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:18.830
 the wires we turn on check 1 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.190
 Immediately they exhibited on least such 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.180
 Illumination interesting blue 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:31.250
 cool glows so it means we are blue 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.940
 got caught though check everything out 1 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 add 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.210
 I 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.830
 audible year 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.830
 at least maxim works 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.469
 everything is fine the second zalmanov skogo and 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:00.790
 so usually he will be heard per kilometer 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:07.090
 before he went straight to take-off too 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:12.980
 works so 3 but hire inverted 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.430
 turn on the reason you will need to where 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.430
 skillfully 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.720
 works too that schmitt 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.319
 but 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:33.969
 everything is fine and 4 that's it always 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.210
 something quietly worked so we now 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.939
 hear and so here it is now in general 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.389
 practically he gets up the most minimal 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:50.099
 turns here even his 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:50.099
 it is necessary to slow down now add to the full 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.150
 but it is silent on its own 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:08.650
 box and somewhere up to 2.8 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:11.529
 Amp for three can say so and 30 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.129
 watts her maximum consumption then 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:19.539
 there are for fans these somewhere here by 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:23.889
 how much probably panel 2 amps times 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:27.849
 two three and this one to zero four to zero 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.750
 zero 35 i.e. somewhere about one 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.800
 there are three times less than he can give 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.159
 I think with a powerful emperor too 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.389
 work okay all right 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:44.879
 disassemble until presented 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.879
 photos on it all 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.490
